{"question": "What are some behavioral tools and supplements that can help manage ADHD, and how do they compare to prescription medications in terms of effectiveness and individualized treatment plans?", "doc_id": "-e9ErUozQo4_3", "video_id": "-e9ErUozQo4", "video_title": "LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman at the Brisbane Convention & Exhibition Centre", "video_header": "ADHD Management: Tools & Medications", "segment_idx": "3", "time_start": "7:43", "time_end": "12:42", "context": "managing ADH if not taking medication okay so we did two episodes of The hubman L podcast on ADHD the first was on behavioral nutritional and supplement based tools 50% of the comments like thank you so much this is very helpful um can't wait to try some of the stuff the other will like get your evil um um you are you're trying to persuade people to not take Pharmaceuticals which is not true I I I'm interested in all of it I just covered that stuff in the first episode and then the second one we did on H ADHD was about things like viance adderal rlin Etc most of which by the way are amphetamines are we putting our kids on speed yes yeah they're amphetamines but I don't think that we should walk away from those things in every case they do have real clinical value in many cases and their clinical value comes from the fact that one not all but one of the major effects of amphetamines is that it can increase dopaminergic and nergic meaning dopamine and norrine release in the brain which can increase attention and focus which is actually beneficial in some cases for the brain to learn to focus to get neuroplasticity of those very circuits so it's a you know you know consideration then 50% of the comments of that second episode were why don't you talk about the behavioral tools the suppl based tools and the nutrition tools and um and that everyone else said thank you for talking about the prescription drugs so the point being several fold one is that certainly a combination of Behavioral nutritional supplement based and prescription tools is viable for most every situation and it's worth thinking about all of those when considering a treatment for ADHD and think we really need to get out of these silos of thinking you know like big Pharma is evil listen there are drugs that can help people is it evil I don't know is it going away no okay is there value there sometimes is it overprescribed sometimes what about nutritional tools well in some cases it can really help in other cases it one still needs prescription drug Tools in some cases doing behavioral nutritional or supplement based tools can allow one to take lower doses of pharmaceuticals if that's your goal I think it really needs to be tailored to the individual what I would like to see is more of a tailoring to the individual than the simple write a script send people off or tell people that it's all bad if it comes out of a prescription uh drug label format now it is very clear that the original dosing schedule for things like Aderall viance Etc was during the week weekday but not the weekends that somehow has moved to uh no weekends off so there's been a lot of changing in the the dosing schedules um and the way these drugs are taken are we creating a dependency on these drugs is always a big question and the answer seems to be a sort of very few people for whom these drugs work decide to come off them there's nothing magical about turning 25 after which you don't need these these enhancements but sometimes people don't need them or need as much of them because the neural circuits can be built up one thing that I would like to see more of is attention to the behavioral tools for ADHD not the least of which is what's being carried out in many schools and Clinics in China where people are being encour children are being encouraged to teach themselves how to maintain visual focus on a Target some distance away from them which then allows them to maintain cognitive focus when they move to their work the relationship between visual Focus as we've talked about a bunch of times tonight in the case of the cuddlefish ETC and cognitive focus is a an intimate one such that if you expect yourself to focus you you can't really expect yourself to drop into Focus as an immediate State you know so it's not a square wave function as you say you don't just sit down and drop into a state of Focus right we're so attracted to these Notions of of focus and we have these Concepts like flow and by the way I'm I'm not disparaging of those Concepts I know Stephen Cotler I have respect for him and his books um about flow but from a neuros psychiatric neuros pychological standpoint you know what we can really say about flow is that backwards spells wolf we don't really know that much about it um and so I think that if you expect yourself to focus you need to give yourself some warm-up time to focus don't assume that you have attention issues if you sit down and it takes five or 10 minutes to drop into a state of focus just like you wouldn't expect yourself to go out for a hard run without some sort of warm-up jog beforehand so the behavioral tools such as focusing on a visual Target are underexplored at least in most countries but in China and elsewhere they are being explored pretty extensively so I would encourage a full exploration of all the tools in this case it says not taking medication then obviously heavier Reliance on the behavioral tools is going to be helpful while I'm getting more sleep now I neglected sleep for many years me

"time_end": "18:48", "context": "and at least 15 years of getting just five or so am I doomed or can I offset this past damage you can offset the past damage one of the things that's really um wonderful about the brain and body is that it can compensate you know there's certain things that I get asked a lot I don't know why I get this question a lot but people say you know I smoked meth for years and then um can I get my neurons back and I'm like well you know it's neurotoxic but the fact that you're asking the question is reassuring um you know so don't start um but if you did you know I mean you can always do better than you're doing and you certainly can do better than you did in your past or at least that's what they tell me um um so really when it comes to sleep deprivation you know I spent many all nighters um I I wouldn't talk about sleep so much if I didn't have challenges with sleep I mean for a long time I slept like a bulldog I would sleep anywhere any time by the way folks if you ever walk down the street and you see a bulldog and you stop you'll notice they always stop they always seem so friendly they always stop they always stop and they look up at you and you pet them and like the reason they seem to like you so much is because they love to stop I owned one they're all about the stopping it's all it's not you it's about the stopping anyway the the goal is not necessarily to sleep as much as a bulldog actually it's the only animal see can't help myself it's the only animal for which there's a genetically induced apnea they're bracky calic which means they have a short snout they all those folds you know you know when the folds are there the folds are there because they have a genetic mutation they bred out the pain receptors in the face because they used to like have them like they would bull bait they bite on the face of the bull they kill all the pain they bred out the pain receptors gave them a floppy face short snout English Bulldog thank you for the specificity a biologist loves the specificity the Frenchies are pretty cool the Frenchies are pretty cool they have a little more kicking them right the Bulldogs little less and costell was a bulldog master so he was s of more or less like a sea turtle you know just slow movement stopping and he's going forward and you can move aside or in fact Costello was so mellow that when he would lie down on the floor had one of those you know kind of robot vacuums things we call a Roomba in our country it would come up to his face and he would just and it would bounce off his nose and he wouldn't even take the opportunity to Blink it's the Bulldog is sort of the essence of a om of effort and actually if you look at people people resemble different dog breeds I spent a lot of time thinking about this some dogs and some people have a bit more kind of reverberation in them they've got a higher RPM all the time all the time all the time and then they're the Bulldogs right Rick Rubin right there are these people that are just more still and we look at these people that are more still and think well there probably isn't that much going on in there but now we know from the Rick thing and the Carl thing that they're thinking a lot but in the case of Costello they don't don't get much done you know I maybe Costello wanted to get things done but I he if he woke up on New Year's Day and said all right 50 rabbits this year he never actually achieved that but listen the point is some of us sleep like Bulldogs some of us tend to go to sleep and wake up in the middle of the night I'm one of those people go to sleep four hours wake up I hate it it but I figured out that non-sleep deep breast or yoga needra has taught me how to fall back asleep really quickly and I can recover some sleep I haven't gotten through non-sleep deep breast some people are waking up in the middle of the night because they don't have their sleep timing right we have a series on sleep coming out soon with the great Matt Walker we record a six episode series with Matt and he talks about something I take no credit for this this is Matt's acronym qqr T quality quantity regularity and timing you want to pay attention to to the amount of sleep some people need six some people need eight if you only got seven for years and you're reading that you need eight or else you'll get dementia please don't worry about it it is simply not the case some people need less some people need more this varies across the lifespan then there's the quality how much of that sleep is continuous did you drink caffeine in the afternoon or alcohol in the evening in which case the quality will be diminished the regularity is very interesting going to sleep more or less five nights a week at least going to sleep more or less at the same time every night plus or minus an hour it's fine on the weekends I'm not just saying that so you don't all leave at once or a third of you leave um some people do Best by going to bed at 800 or 900 p.m. and waking up at 3:00 or 4 in the morning and that's where you would feel best in fact if you're somebody that wakes up at 3:00 or 4 in the morning you might be going to sleep too late and you have this intrinsic chronotype as it's called and you can shift your clock a bit later but most people want to go to bed sometime between 10:00 p.m. and midnight wake up sometime between 6:00 a.m. and 800 a.m. am and there's great variation there too um but you know qqr T so think about the quality the quantity the regularity and the timing once you dial those in everything is much much better so much so that even if you're not getting enough sleep as long as you're going to bed more or less the same time each night you'll you'll Faire better so if you didn't do any of this stuff for years like I didn't uh in when I was in graduate school Etc I don't despair don't despair um it's very clear that the brain can recover um and I wouldn't waste a single moment thinking about what you didn't do um also my time machine's broken your time machine's broken I realize that doesn't create a lot of comfort but it's unlikely that you did substantial damage unlikely you did substantial damage unless you did that your whole life and we're talking about a conversation that's happening late late in life but even then more sleep would be better do you

there a name for that okay T the T at the end of trt is therapy testosterone replacement therapy testosterone replacement therapy technically means that someone's levels prior to that therapy fall outside the reference range so low lower than 300 nanograms per deciliter typically or some other array of symptoms at and they replace it replacement therapy many many people nowadays in my opin opinion for far too many and Too Young take what I call testosterone augmentation therapy where their levels are within normal range and then they take it to get out of range and look there's nothing wrong with that I'm not going to tell you what to do I'm not a cop you do what you want to do um there a couple things trt or tat augmentation and here we're just setting aside high do steroid use um cuz that's just a whole other Biz and and frankly the bodybuilders will get upset but um but I'll get away from you because you'll be waddling and I'll be running um the that's just like a whole other business so um testosterone replacement therapy is um widely used nowadays I think far too young basically it will lower your sperm count dramatically if you're a male so so you'd have if you want children um you want to conceive children you will need to offset that by taking something like human chonic gonadotrope and HCG um which is available synthetically they used to sell it in the form of pregnant women's urine um there was a black market for it we could really go off into the sticks with this question um my in my opinion if you want to explore this I would say first get your behaviors right sleep exercise nutrition stress control training get that right don't train too hard or too long get that right then there are certain supplements and we've talked about this on the podcast some are debated a little bit more than others things like zinc Tong Ali Etc that can probably provide a boost Beyond normal without shutting down the goads um and then and only then if you feel you really want to do this and it's in line with your ethics or you know I don't know if you're playing a drug tested sport Etc um then just minimal effective dose and then if you want to have kids someday or if you don't know if you want to have kids someday make sure you're taking the appropriate things to offset that that's basically what I would say and the major effect of testosterone in men and women is not libido per se and it's not aggression per se it tends to make people more like them if you're a jerk you're going become more of a jerk if you're calm you're become more calm if you're kind you're GNA I don't know if you become Kinder but there actually been studies of altruistic behavior and administration of testosterone by nasal spray or other means and frankly people will become more they'll become competitively altruistic um I think the major effect also could be described as it makes effort feel good so um we could go on and on about this I'll just toss in that nowadays there's a lot of excitement about peptides I'm going to do an episode about peptides a lot of the young people I run into um here and in the states are like what are you what are your thoughts on bpc c57 what do you think about this peptide or that peptide peptides are simply small proteins um amino acid chains um so there are lots of things called peptides but typically these are things that increase growth hormone that keep in mind that anything that increases growth hormone will increase the growth of any and all tissues so if you have a small tumor that you're not aware of that will grow also so just keep in mind if you're going to tickle these Pathways you're you're playing some with some serious biology but there are safe ways to do it sorry you said What are the benefits of star it sooner rather than later uh start it later what are the physiological and practical differences between breathing"}

we all be doing to give our children the best start in life and and what does that mean for those of us that have already started in life um so first of all we have a episode of The hubman Lab podcast with an absolutely magnificent guest Dr Becky Kennedy um coming out on I guess it' be Tuesday down here so this coming week all about this and you know we could talk about things for learning encourage them to play an instrument um I would think that we perhaps should teach kids some tools to modulate their stress in real time like physiological size I don't see why not um I certainly wish I had tools to regulate my stress when I was younger now they didn't teach us that stuff they didn't know it where it the knowledge was there but as I mentioned earlier they didn't teach us that stuff they taught us all sorts of stuff in high school health and stuff I mean they they taught us that you know drunk driving's bad um they taught us it just takes one sperm one time they um they taught us all sorts of stuff but they didn't teach us the uh this business of physiological size or stress thresholds or about the intering L cortex because a lot of that stuff wasn't known or just wasn't discussed so I think some tools to control one 's inner landscape play music I certainly am going to encourage the exploration of these energy states that you know letting kids explore I mean they need rules and Regulation and boundaries of course but there's this concept of impingement that I find very interesting that the classic psychologists used to talk about you know when we when a kid says they like something or don't like things like yes they need to be doing certain things for their normal life progression but kids are very good sensors of what works for them and what doesn't work for them we don't want to impinge on certainly their healthy loves and desires things that don't endanger them right things that are really reflect their unique loves and desires don't force them to play Suzuki violin if they want to play the drums right let let them bang on stuff and let the kids that want to play Suzuki violin do that don't make them play the drums so these impingements actually I think are are problematic they they lead to a lot of Confusion And if anything else they you know they they take us away from that unique wiring to be our own unique expression um Becky Kennedy does describe a few key principles of parenting that I think are really interesting that extend to all kinds of relationships she talks about the main role of parenting and to some extent all relationships is to create boundaries and to make kids feel safe seems pretty good to me um the other kind of short list of two things and she describes how to do this in in ways that um are highly actionable is that every child I found this really interesting every child wants to feel real like they want to feel like they're real like they're seen they exist and they want to feel safe and so that one of the things that really rung in my ears and still does from that episode recording again out this week is that when a kid or an adult says something about how they feel that perhaps one of the best responses we can give them is you know I believe you like that it doesn't you're not saying that like you don't want to go to school don't go to school right we're not saying you don't you don't enjoy doing something don't do it or or you want like a you know a fifth serving of candy like you can say like I believe you you know no um you know and so I think that a lot of it is is is you know we get confused with terms like validation and listening I mean what I like so much about what Becky offers um and I'm I do hope to do a Child Development series and the not too distant future um what what I like so much about what Becky offers is that you know it boils down to simple Concepts like we want to be real which I guess is a kind of an analog for scene and we want to feel safe not unlike when we did the podcast series on Mental Health with Dr Paul kti he said you know it's really about mental health is really about agency and gratitude but there are a lot of things that siphon up into those feelings or those moments of or that state of agency and gratitude so I I would say that's perhaps the most important thing is you know boundaries make kids feel safe and then make them feel real like their feelings and and what they're reporting matters um and then of course the impingement thing becomes a little bit complicated because they do need boundaries so we have to constrain their wishes sometimes and their behavior but we don't want to do it in a way that takes them away from that unique wiring that makes them who they are so they can become you know the the characters and people and professionals and creatives and scientists and Poets and just you know good people right everyday good people so that's the best answer I can provide at this time they're not going to give me another question but I can keep going just briefly if I may um by just first of all"}

we've taken or what is happening to us has a powerful effect on our physiology it's not purely psychological the whole business of psychosomatic even that word is starting to fall away as we start to understand that our beliefs have a powerful effect on what happens to us physiologically so much so that for instance my colleague Ali Crum a tenar professor at Stanford's Department of psychology who's been a guest on the podcast who studies mindsets has done beautiful experiments on stress showing that if you watch a short video about stress and you learn all the terrible things that stress can do to your cognition your sleep and your well-being well that indeed that happens and that if you watch a short video about how stress can be performance- enhancing by sharpening your mental acuity your access to particular memory stores Etc that indeed that happens so-called belief effects why belief effects not Placebo effects well Placebo effects tend to be more General belief effects tend to be around specific types of information but the placebo effect has recently been shown to extend to a dose dependent placebo effect one of the more remarkable papers I think published in the last few years most people are unaware of I talked about this in a journal Club episode of The hubman Lab podcast with the one and only Peter Atia described a paper where people took either zero I believe it was .25 milligrams half a milligram or a gram of nicotine which is known to be a cognitive enhancer please don't smoke dip Huffer snuff nicotine that's erous in those forms but and taking nicotine can increase blood pressure Vasa constriction Etc but nicotine is a cognitive enhancer it is a cognitive enhancer and I can't help but tell you one story about this before I get back to placebo effect don't worry I always make my way back you can see why living with me as a child was so challenging um nicotine I was told by a very very famous Nobel laurate member M of the Neuroscience Community because I visited his office I won't tell you who it is at Columbia University I met with him and he was telling me about what he studies but I noed he chewed no fewer than six pieces of Nicorette during the course of that conversation and I had to just stop him at one point and say why are you consuming all this nicotine and he said well it's what's going to allow me to saave off Parkinson's and Alzheimer's of course and I don't want to smoke and I said really and he said yeah there's some evidence that keeping levels of neuromodulators like dopamine acetylcholine elevated despite the increases in blood pressure that are caused by consuming nicotine May indeed offset Parkinson's and Alzheimer's I'm not telling you this as a clinical trial I'm telling you this as anic data he is a Nobel Prize winner he's still very very sharp in his 80s the point here is that in a study of nicotine and cognition where people's cognition is indeed enhanced by nicotine everybody knows that and agrees upon that people who were told they had a higher dose of nicotine performed better in this cognitive task when in fact they consumed zero and people who performed moderately who were then told that they had consumed a higher dose of nicotine performed better than those that simply consumed the moderate dose and were told they had a moderate dose in other words everyone gets the same dose either zero or moderate but depending on what you're told your performance changes accordingly and that's cool but what's really cool about the study is they actually recorded from brain centers of these individuals and the levels of activity in particular areas of the brain that are relevant for cognition changed according to what the people believe so there you go placebo effect is changing neural activity it's not all just through what you think is happening what you think is happening is the reflection of neural activity and then you go well of course but I think it's an important study so I believe in the placebo effect and it is dose dependent and that raises all sorts of scary concerns about the placebo effect but it's also pretty darn cool because what it means is that our belief system including our understanding of the mechanisms that are likely driving certain effects of drugs or protocols or what have you is going to play a powerful role in whether or not we get the effect that we want and perhaps that's the most important thing provided that you're going about it safely how do I enter the rest and digest State and exit my constant fight"}

{"question": "Is it true that our brains need periods of rest and relaxation, such as sleep, to undergo significant changes and adaptation, and how does this differ from muscle growth and endurance

from consuming new information or is the rest when we sleep great questions thank you Timothy um yes indeed our muscles get stronger grow after a proper stimulus is applied to them in the time after we provide that stimulus which typically is resistance but since not everyone's interested in that it's also the case that an endurance adaptation occurs after we embark on the run the hike the swim Etc there's something kind of interesting and I just want to take a moment and just um mention that there's something kind of interesting about resistance training is that the one form of training that because of the enhanced blood flow to the muscles while we do it gives us a window into what the adaptation might look like once it occurs if we allow proper rest whereas with endurance training it's very different right you go further and or you run up a hill until your legs burn and you want to vomit up a and then the next time you do it you don't feel quite as bad right the adaptation occurs of course in a very similar way to resistance training different mechanisms but there's a delay and adaptation you get better it's just that with resistance training you can kind of sense the change before the change occurs because of the enhanced blood flow of the muscles with endurance training you sense the limit of your ability and then you exceed that limit subsequently now in terms of cognitive learning the same thing is basically true if you want to get really technical about it the computational biology the modeling of this says that if you want to learn something probably setting the difficulty of what you're trying to learn to about 85% correct trials 15% error trials is probably ideal what does that mean it means if you're trying to learn a new piano piece you know or you're trying to teach that to a child if they're not starting from scratch let them play something that they know pretty well and then introduce a small percentage maybe 10 to 15 maybe 20% you don't have to be exact about this of Novel material that's hard for them to learn but yes it is the focused deliberate attempt to learn something that creates that sense of underlying agitation that is the trigger the stimulus for neuroplasticity this makes sense if you could complete something if you could do something a scale on of Music a physical task speaking a new language if you could do that why would your nervous system ever change and how does your nervous system know if it's supposed to change right your nervous system doesn't know successful trial versus failure trial right I've tried many times to learn other languages and I'm you know modestly terrible at Spanish but if I were to try and get better my nervous system doesn't know when I'm failing has no idea what it knows is the release of certain neurom modulators namely adrenaline and norepinephrine and a few others as well that are associated with the underlying agitation of like I'm failing at this I'm not able to remember that Spanish class because I didn't attend in high school and this is really difficult and that agitation the frustration is the stimulus but when we say frustration it's the neurochemicals that when they bathe the surrounding neurons those neurons go oh something needs to change for next time and lo and behold the stimulus for neuroplasticity has occurred but the actual rewiring of the neurons either the Improvement or the reduction in the strength of synapsis of connections between neurons and in rare instances the addition of new neurons for neuroplasticity occurs yes when we sleep in states of deep rest or non-sleep deep rest although there's less data to support that but the actual rewiring occurs away from the stimulus so there's really two important principles here one is that agitation and stress and the neurochemicals that underly agitation and stress that is the stimulus for Learning and goodness do I wish they had taught me that in school I mean they taught me all sorts of things in school but they didn't teach me that they didn't teach me the physiological side Lord knows I would have done better in life if I had those tools instead they told me look you know if you drive drunk you could die that was good information but they didn't tell us about all the other stuff so I wish they told us about the stimulus and rest thing and somehow they have permission to talk about the rest all right what's my take on hallucinations goodness gracious my take"}

compelling what do we know about these data and yes I've participated in two such clinical trials one on high do psilocybin high dose meaning more than two grams taken twice by the way this is with the support of medically trained therapists and the use of psychedelics such as psilocybin mostly psilocybin not so much LSD do you know why most of the trials are on psilocybin and not LSD I do but I'm curious if you know it's not to what's that LSD is too long that's right that people need to go home people need to go home the technicians need to go and LSD is a long ride it's a long ride so the the thing about cybin is that the you know the sort of Journey the trip is you know somewhere on the order of anywhere from you know 3 to 7 hours which can fit into a reason able work day for a technician clinician um and LSD can be many many hours longer the kind of um Mount Everest of psychedelics which is under investigation by a colleague of mine at Stanford School of Medicine Nolan Williams is ibigan iboga which is 22 hours long it has cardiac effects this is not something to to get Cavalier with this is something only to be done in a clinical context with medical experts there and iboga is very interesting from what I'm told I have not participated in iboga trial iboga allows for or induces a state in which you do not hallucinate at all with eyes open but the moment you go eyes closed you get a highresolution accurate picture of Prior events in your life but you have agency you have volition inside of those pictures and you're able to change your behavior and resculpt your Rel relationship to those experiences like wow and the state of Kentucky in California recently excuse me the state of Kentucky in the United States thank goodness Kentucky isn't inside of California that would be civil war the state of Kentucky recently took the $40 million settlement from the opioid thing right you've all heard about that the opioid crisis and applied that money to iboga trials so this stuff is happening this stuff is really happening now in the US in any event psilocybin these two sessions medically supported two sessions um has been shown to be pretty effective in the treatment of major depression not completely effective sometimes there's adverse outcomes but far more effective than the other pharmaceutical treatments that it's been compared to so that's interesting and psilocybin is serotonin if you look at the structure of psilocybin and it looks like serotonin so we're talking about is a massive dose of Serotonin and psilocybin appears to bind near selectively to a particular serotonin receptor and the outcome seems to be enhanced or more more broad connectivity between brain areas that normally are not communicating with one another probably not the growth of new connections but the let's say the unveiling of the ability for certain brain areas to communicate with with one another whereas they couldn't prior different ways of thinking about the same problems which is logically sound if you think about ways to deal with depression depression is characterized by a number of things of course but one of the Hallmark features of depression in addition to sleep challenges is a lack of positive anticipation of the future and it does seem that these macro do cocin trials are helpful for that turns out that the micro doing of psilocybin has not been shown to be Terri effective which is not to say it isn't but the trials don't support that although there aren't many Trials of that yet so it appears you know if you had to pick between micro and macro dosing go macro um but be careful um go be careful and and set in setting is important safety is important and certainly not for children and as long as and or adolescence or teenagers I really again want to want to reemphasize that the the other thing is as long as we're talking psychedelics and hallucinogens we should probably just touch on MDMA for a moment first of all MDMA ecstasy um has a number of challenges or potential problems that need to be highlighted first of all um contaminants you know we have a fentanyl crisis in the US so contaminants so Purity is essential second of all it is methylene dioxy methampetamine and the methamphetamine part often gets people thinking like whoa it seems however that the inclusion of the methylene dioxy component increases serotonin dramatically and it is the increase in serotonin perhaps or at least it's now thought in addition to the increase in dopamine caused by the methampetamine component combined that provides some sort of neuroprotective effect the early reports that MDMA ecstasy is neurotoxic quote unquote puts holes in your brain was flawed by and indeed that paper was retracted the researchers did"}

I must say down here y'all are really evolved in this Dimension the other day I noticed probably from jet lag and travel and I don't know maybe I swam in some stuff that had too much chlorine or something I was getting like some little like skin thing on my face I was like all right I'll go go get some triple antibiotic ointment like I do back home clean it up because I forgot mine so I go to the pharmacy here what you call the chemist I go to the pharmacy and and the guy behind the counter says well you don't first of all you can't get triple antibiotic ointment here you need a prescription like all right well this is going to get tricky now I got to forge a prescription and and I'm just kidding don't do that don't do that um and he says but you know have you considered whether or not maybe your skin microbiome is struggling because of the lack of sleep the jetl and maybe you were exposed to some chlorine or something I thought you know that's a logical way to think about it cuz cuz we just did an episode on oral health where I'm telling everybody hey like avoid these like high alcohol astringent mouthwashes that kill your oral microbiome because all the dentists and periodontists are telling me yeah they'll make your breath fresh but actually it's Wrecking your gut microbiome and it's bad for so I take the probiotic you guys have amazing probiotics here and in a day boom it's done now I didn't do a control clinical trial I don't know whether or not that was really what did it but it's an interesting idea this I we know for instance that we have a distinct microbiome niches different bacteria that live in our nasal passages on the surface of our eyes on the surface of our skin in the urethra in essentially every orifice mucus membrane but everywhere in and around our body and that these little microbiota are provided they are supported they do many things but among them the gut microbiome which of course start in the mouth as the oral health episode um describes with a lot of protocols as well the the gut microbiome when it's well supported creates certain fatty acids that are the precursors or catalysts for the production of certain neurotransmitters in the brain and it is now oh so clear that enhancing the diversity of Flora of microbiota in the gut and mouth is great for the nervous system so much so that some of the studies on on relief from certain Neuropsychiatric conditions are being achieved through and I know it's not pleasant but microbiota transfer between individual so-called fecal transplants which always makes me a little bit uncomfortable to think about never had one but you know it's pretty interesting you know despite the discomfort of thinking about that process at least for me the the whole business of taking the gut microbiota from one individual that's not suffering from something and putting it into another individual and seeing Rel from certain symptoms of given conditions is really compelling so I think that we should all be thinking about ways to support our gut brain AIS it's very clear that the best lowcost no supplement way to do that is going to be to consume one to four servings of some fermented food no beer doesn't count low sugar fermented foods I suppose beer does count but it comes with some other issues um such as you know kimch or Sauer krauts or kefir or you know every culture seems to have its own uh probiotic Prebiotic foods and that's going to be the best way and it's clear that it has immense benefit and then when you don't have access to those Foods doing things like taking a pill probiotic now and again is probably not a bad idea if you're traveling or you're sleep deprived the the the challenge with that sort of thing is that it's a generalized effect of supporting multiple systems in the brain and body so it's going to be a long time maybe never before you see a really nice clean study that says that okay increasing the amount of lactobacillus in the gut by taking you know X number of milligrams of lactobacillus improves your cognition you're not going to find that study why because in science it's important and in health to distinguish between moderating effects and mediating effects lots of things can moderate a given feature of your brain or health so for instance if uh you know God for a bit of fire alarm went off tonight it would moderate our tension or excuse me modulate modulate Kies in California now I'm saying moderate modulate your attention but it doesn't mediate attention on a normal basis you know the fire alarm isn't involved in your attention whereas certain other things mediate those mechanisms of attention so when you improve sleep you're going to see positive effects on any number of things when you sleep deprive people you're going to see deficit in any number of things these are not Direct effects these are indirect effects likewise with the microbiome so I think gut microbiome sits in the various what I call pillars of mental health physical health and performance these are the things that we should try and tend to on a regular basis to give buoyancy to our mental health physical health and performance but I wouldn't get too caught up in wondering which exact microbiota are important I think diversity of the microbiome is key if you're taking antibiotics you want to do something to counter that through pill probiotics Etc and and certainly antibiotics aren't bad but the overuse of antibiotics um certainly can be and um good on you for having uh chemists that know better than to just hand me a bottle of triple antibiotic ointment quality of sleep going to bed early compared to sleeping late but still for eight hours depends"}

{"question": "What are some effective strategies for gradually increasing focus and attention span, especially for individuals with ADHD, and how can they be incorporated into daily life to improve productivity and overall well-being?", "doc_id": "yOoVz9E9kfQ_16", "video_id": "yOoVz9E9kfQ", "video_title": "LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman at the ICC Sydney Theatre", "video_header": "Addressing ADHD & Focus in the Modern World", "segment_idx": "16", "time_start": "42:53", "time_end": "49:22", "context": "focus Nick okay so I think that nowadays many many people people struggle with um issues with Focus I think we have our dos and our do Nots and I'm obviously not a psychiatrist and I can't diagnose you Nick from a question on a on a slide but there I just want to start off by saying that there are indeed people who truly struggle with Focus to the extent that they have clinically diagnosable ADHD and I've did two episodes on ADHD and focus one that was mainly focused on behavioral tools and nutrition and to some extent supplementation and when I put out that episode about half of the comments out there were how could you you don't respect modern science you have no um Integrity how could you suggest that people use these tools it's all about prescription drugs and the other half were like yes finally some tools and some acknowledgement that these things actually matter and can help maybe even in conjunction with pharmaceutical AIDS and then we did a second episode which is about the prescription drugs and it was the exact reverse people writing to me in droves saying thank you so much I've been prescribing these drugs or I've been giving these prescription drugs to my child rather it's really been helping but I'm embarrassed to tell everybody because then people demonize me and tell me I'm poisoning my kid that they're on meth and then the other half saying how could you the pharmaceutical industry big Pharma is out to get us all I must say that um and I'm happy to be in this role um or not happy but I'm willing to be in the role of try and cover it all and give people options I don't tell people what to do I don't prescribe anything I profess many many things and you should do is you decide is best for you but just know what you're doing and here's the deal that drugs like adderal viant Etc are indeed amphetamines that's true um in the young brain they can help enhance some of the neurom modulators that allow for elevated activity in areas like the prefrontal cortex and elsewhere that allow for more focused attention and less impuls ity because the main function of the prefrontal cortex as you may all recall is to say to the particular areas of the brain that want to move or cause us to move or cause us to blurt things out like DMT or whatever it is and sorry I didn't mean to pick on you I we'll do DMT together we'll do some MDMA also and then we'll like be we like we heart heart medicine um so the reality is that there are neurochemical tools that can help help with ADHD but there are also behavioral tools and in countries outside of the US namely in China there are extensive efforts to train young people to focus for longer periods of time and believe it or not they're not doing that through any D at least in these experiments through any Draconian approach they actually have them do what they have them focus on visual targets the longer you focus on a visual Target we know the longer you bring about the activation of certain neural circuit in the brain that allow for better focus and while not everything is about Vision it is certainly the case based on those studies and the data I've looked at them quite extensively that even a short period of time of learning to entrain one's focus on a fixation points this would be the Virgin side movement this is the Cuttlefish ready to eat or mate not the Cuttlefish swimming around looking for potential predators in panoramic mode doing that for a short period of time of even a minute or 3 minutes can allow one to bring online the neural circuits that allow for enhanced focus in the subsequent 10 to 20 minutes which is a pretty reasonable bout of work if you think about it and here's another important Point none of us none of us ADHD sufferers or otherwise should expect ourselves to be in perfect trenches deep trenches of focus all the time that's an unreasonable request for your nervous system you can build up a capacity to focus and of course we can all Focus best on things that we really enjoy in fact children and adults with ADHD are known to have tremendous focusing capacity if they're focusing on something they really enjoy this has been shown over and over again which means that the capacity to focus is there it's just that the threshold to focus is higher which means that it's harder to access and these visual fixation they're not even experiments you can literally just place a visual Target on the wall you know one to three feet away force yourself to stare at that visual Focus point and then move into your work and you'll notice that your mind will flit away from whatever it is you're trying to focus on but with some training you can build up an enhanced capacity to focus it does require you flip your phone over you turn it off you leave it in the other room you remove distractions some people even find children will find if they wear a brimmed hat and a hoodie which basically took me through most of high school for other reasons if you do that you can create a more narrow tunnel of vision this is the reason they put blinders on horses so it sounds somewhat um medieval it some sounds somewhat primitive or crude but once again again what we're really talking about is removing the expectation that focus is like a square wave function where you know you you sit down you open your book and boom you're focused I mean you wouldn't expect that of physical performance would you there's a warm-up there's some Dynamic stretching there's perhaps some just getting your mind in the groove you know this sort of thing neural circuits are not onof it's not a square wave function takes some time to ease into a motive focus and so um my suggest question Nick is that you and others that struggle with Focus think about the do Nots the distractions that clearly are intervening in our ability to focus nowadays but also as you think about the things to explore which may include these pharmaceutical tools of course prescribed by a licensed physician but that you consider that perhaps the expectations that you're placing on yourself to focus are too immediate and that you should train these up more gradually over time which is not to say that you should settle on having limited Focus but that this is a skill that you can develop like any other skill that your nervous system is capable of plasticity throughout the lifespan we absolutely know that and given that uh I'm presuming I don't know why I'm presuming that you're a young person but even if you're not that you can increase your ability to access these narrow trenches of focus even for things that don't Delight you but I hope you are you are also doing some things that Delight you so I was told that's the final"}

{"question": "What are some factors that affect our subjective experience of time, and how can our visual system influence our perception of time?", "doc_id": "GA89kjVY6Ik_5", "video_id":

something I'm trying to do more of not necessarily lives but that too but um someone recently uh who I I love and admire very much said to me we're gonna have so much fun and I thought whoa like behold no one's ever said that to me no one's ever said that to me all my years growing up I I mean I mean I love with with all due respect to my parents I can't remember anyone ever turning to me and saying we're going to have so much fun so I'm trying that that to me just kind of blew me away I'm think yeah like you're allowed to have fun so time perception is a topic that I am you know as obsessed by as I am many other topics um but one that is really near and dear to my heart because I've always been struck by this observation that is certainly not uniquely mine that you know if you're sitting waiting for an appointment at the doctor's office it feels like time goes by really slowly like really slowly whereas if you have a really full day with lots and lots of activities it seems like time went by really fast like oh my God I can't believe that so much time has G by sorry so much has happened excuse me but not a lot of time has gone by which means that our frame rate on life is highly Dynamic and in fact it is and in fact it's set by you guessed it our visual system at least for cited folks for people who are low vision or no vision and by the way I I always reference that because my laboratory has worked on low vision no vision um issues for a number of years it's through the auditory system but for sake of generalizing now and simplicity we'll talk about the visual system so it is a fact that when we focus on things up close think of watchmaker think about looking into your phone our perception of time is more fine grain that is our frame rate is higher okay so more frames per second than when we view things at a distance you might think well how could that possibly be how could that possibly be but it makes perfect sense you know when we think about the time space coding in the brain we need to Anchor ourselves to something the rising and setting of the sun of course the you know I mean unless you're a flat earther you know we're going around the Sun now what's that no someone we got no flat earthers One Flat earther in the audience let okay cool um uh yeah just I don't think that's what they were saying but um but we need to Anchor ourselves in time and our visual system is the way that we anchor ourselves in time we have facts about past present and future so we have knowledge but at an unconscious level we need to Anchor our frame rate set our frame rate and so this is why if you go down to Bondi and you lie back and you look up at the clouds and the clouds are kind of moving in an unpredictable way whenever we're looking at a landscape which has some lack of predictable features like waves or rustling of trees where you could predict that if the wind's blowing this way that the trees going to go this way and then back again but you're not not really in a mode of trying to anticipate just how far in the same way that for instance if you call an Uber you're waiting on a text message you know if you're ever waiting on a text message you notice you'll F slice okay dot dot dot when's that thing coming when's that thing you're fine slicing time as your level of autonomic arousal goes up your frame rate goes up as your level of autonomic arousal goes down so you're sleepy or if you're viewing things that have kind of an unpredictable aspect to them then your frame rate expands your the passage of time changes or your perception of the passage of time changes this is why one of the reasons why I love Aquaria you know and one of my favorite things to do since I don't have a fish tank at home right now but that's going to change soon is I'll go on YouTube and there's this beautiful live video of this aquarium in Japan and I'll just zone out it's like the most relaxing thing ever and every once in a while a whale they have a whale shark in an aquarium every once in a while a whale shark will go through and you go like whoa and then it disappears and then the little fish and the kelp and things like and it's immensely relaxing what it does is it slows your frame rate down and then I find that resets me after just five or six minutes to go back to doing this you know High frame rate type stuff which is what we're doing when we're texting when we're typing when we're social media by the way is tuned to a frame rate that's really interesting that keeps us engaged just up to the point where then we want to swipe to the next thing it's it's the algorithms are are designed uh and by the way I have a somewhat benevolent semi benevolent view of social media I think it' be used for good I think it' be used for not good um I think you know limiting one's time on there is good but there's some there's some good content on there for sure a lot of my life is spent on there indeed so frame rate is set by where you're looking the further out you're looking the larger the longer sort of time bins your capturing bigger time bins okay less resolution closer in and the more you're trying to predict the next outcome sort of fine grain analysis predicting what we call dpos duration path and outcome what's going to happen for how long and what's going to happen is something that you're thinking about and wondering about then frame rate goes up and there's actually a wonderful movie um a Hitchcock movie The Name Escapes me at the moment in which Hitchcock understood this and it's a movie that's only about 90 minutes it's long but in the background the sun rises and sets and the way that people move through the scenes of this movie gives you the Feeling by the end of this 90-minute movie that a full 24 hours passed it's really interesting you feel it in your body as if it was a much longer movie even though if you look at your watch that happens and now the Cannabis smokers again are thinking like yeah like where you sit there and you're like whoa that was a really long time you looking it's like three minutes went by and you're like whoa like wow psychedelics will do this as well um they certainly do they distort our time perception mainly through the deployment of large amounts of the neuromodulator serotonin which is intimately involved in kind of clock perception mechanisms there are a bunch of other things that can set sort of in trenic rhythmicity of our auditory system that also adjust our frame rate I think one of the reasons why 40 Herz tones can be valuable for doing cognitive work is that they tend to entrain the the certain circuits within the brain for doing the kinds of work that most people call work kind where you have to type things out think logically kind of if then kind of um analysis very different than say writing new sheet music or coming up with poetry where you know here again we can think back to the you know the Rick Rubin thing or the you know being stationary right you like the W we're sitting with movement and the Brain going forward there's something about adjusting frame rate for capturing new ideas versus implementing ideas implementation of ideas to be carried out on higher frame rate type time perception and now you can understand why our visual perception said about the distance of a laptop or phone would be uh good for that or a conversation you know remember that whole thing of like looking at somebody's face and having a conversation as opposed to looking off into the distance walking and allowing one's gaze to go panoramic so hopefully now you're starting to sense some themes so that that's all I say about time perception now but of course humans have throughout history and still now Frank Al um also embarked on a lot of pharmacology If we're honest in order to try and adjust frame rate for sake of productivity but you know caffeine will injust frame rate in the predictable Direction but also things like alcohol and and various drugs like you know cannabis in order to adjust frame rate I'm certainly not suggesting you do those things I'm not a cop you do what you want just know what you're doing can you please talk about the jet lag"}

"18:22", "time_end": "26:39", "context": "protocol you followed when arriving in Sydney oh yeah well this one was a little bit easier for me because obviously it's not that far off it's just you're a full day ahead uh from where I live back home in California um but nonetheless I suffered tremendously from jet lag and once actually in 2017 I went to Abu Dhabi a 12-hour flip from uh where I was living at that time in the Bay Area and I was a wreck I could barely make it to the meeting I was crying I was like it really messes me up I I slept great the first night and then just didn't sleep for two days I was a mess so jet lag is something that I've really had to work hard on and there are a couple things worth noting and we've done a whole episode about this but I'll kind of hit a few key bullet points and maybe it's relevant to you even if you're not traveling at any point soon because many people are jetlagged without traveling because of the way that they stay up late in fact most everybody in the world now qualifies as a shift worker did you know that and here no disrespect only reverence and gratitude to the actual shift workers that stay up all night doing emergency work and Hospital work and caring for children and things like that throughout the night so I'm not trying to take anything away from them but we are all shifted Enough by virtue of artificial lighting and and uh electronic devices that we are effectively shifted and shift working because we're staying up engaging our cognitive systems in ways that frankly we didn't evolve to which I'm not saying is bad but it's just the reality okay what to do for jet lag the key thing is this and actually this is very valuable in general for sake of sleep so this is something I haven't talked enough about on the podcast ask yourself what time you normally wake up without an alarm I realize there's some variance from dayto day but you know for me it would be about let's say 6:00 a.m. so let's say for you at 7 you know just get pick your typical wakeup time if you subtract from that number so for me 4: a.m. that almost with certainty is what's called your temperature minimum your temperature minimum we could measure it you could put a thermometer in your mouth or if you come to the laboratory Unfortunately they have to do it rectally 4:00 a.m. would be my temperature minimum maybe for you if you wake up at 7 typically or around 7 it's going to be 500 a.m. okay so we're not actually measuring your temperature in this kind of Gunk and this thought experiment what we're doing is we're trying to find a time so here's what's interesting if you expose your eyes not your skin but your eyes to Bright Light in the 2 hours or so maybe 3 hours prior to that temperature minimum time so if you wake up at 7: a.m. 5 a.m. is your temperature minimum so in the two hours maybe three hours prior to that you're going to shift your wakeup time and your toed time what's called a phase delay a shift in your circadian rhythm by about an hour interesting given that if you view bright light in the two to three hours after your temperature minimum you advance your clock meaning you pull back your clock to want to wake up a bit earlier and go to sleep a little bit earlier by about an hour for every time you do that you think well okay I wake up in the morning at 7 and let's say I'm using you as an example or me at 6 and I usually try and get some sunlight in my eyes especially on overcast days etc etc you've heard me blab about this many times before on the podcast and elsewhere so how come I'm not going to bed earlier and earlier every night and waking up earlier and earlier every morning and indeed you would you would keep phase advancing your clock if you did that except that in the afternoon if you got sunlight in your eyes as presumably you did today it was beautiful sunny day on your way here you phase delayed your clock a little bit and as a consequence you wake up and go to sleep at more or less the same time every day it's an amazing mechanism and guess what viewing sunlight in the middle of the day does not do the same thing it doesn't shift your circadian clock they don't tell you that in school but they should they're telling you like all the other stuff the reason it doesn't do it is that middle of the day period is What's called the Circadian Dead Zone sounds very dramatic very ominous getting sunlight in your eyes during the middle of the day is great for mood it's evident that it's also important if it gets on your skin and healthy not burning amounts uh levels that would induce burn that it can enhance testosterone estrogen levels Etc in healthy ways healthy ratios nonetheless that morning sunlight viewing after your temperature minimum advances your clock makes you want to get up earlier go to bed earlier viewed before delays your clock makes you want to get up later go to bed later so this is very useful if you ever want to shift your clock at home before you Trav to get onto a new schedule for work or school or if you're traveling what it means is that when you arrive in a new location like I did in Melbourne the other day believe me I practiced that for like at least an hour you know and with two aies and they kept telling me I was doing it wrong until finally they're like no I'm just joking with you you got it right like the fourth time you guys have a wicked sense of humor down here the I'm tougher than I look the the the key thing is that if you land you have to ask let's say at 8:00 a.m. local or noon local time the key is to ask yourself hm what does my body think what is my temperature minimum back from back home so for instance if you land at 5:00 p.m. but it corresponds to a time before your temperature minimum and you go outside and you're like w W beautiful Setting Sun I'm supposed to get sunlight in my eyes well guess what you might delay your clock if you want to go to bed earlier that's probably not a good idea whereas if you want to stay if you want to advance your clock you would view sunlight at a time that is corresponding to the two hours after your temperature minimum I realize it's a little bit tricky but that's all you have to ask yourself for the first three days first three days that you travel to some location because then you can shift very fast so what that requires is sometimes saying oh I don't want to shift myself so I'm actually going to wear sunglasses and a brimmed hat to avoid shifting because I'd like to be on the local schedule or in some cases you think oh I really want to wake up here and I'm in the perfect opportunity to wake up because it's the middle of the afternoon in Sydney and back home I would have just hit my temperature minimum and so I'm going to get sunlight in my eyes well that's going to wake me up and it's going to actually make me want to go to bed a little bit earlier so I can go to bed at local time so I'm not going to be up until you know 3:00 a.m. so you might have to work this out a little bit on paper but this is the way that military and this is the way that shift workers who are educated in the in the mechanisms of this stuff that's the way they do it it also helps to eat on the local schedule because food is another what we call zeit Gaber another one of the timekeepers for the circadian clock so if you force yourself to eat on the local schedule that can help you shift activity can help you shift and social rhythms can help you shift as well but that temperature minimum and the role of light before or after the temperature minimum either delaying or advancing your clock that's the heavy hammer in this whole process so I did that and these days I do a lot of red light time in the evening when I want to go to sleep and I don't mean red light panels like the expensive stuff that has a whole other set of uses what I'm talking about is just getting a red light like a party light we turn off the lights and put in a red light and that is known to reduce cortisol levels as opposed to other kinds of lighting so it only takes about half hour before you go to sleep or so you want to mellow out you just switch over to Red Light it's actually very pleasant right um as long as you can go about the activities you want to do safely just you know get a you put a red light up and by the way Rick's house is like all red lights at night no artificial lighting past Sundown guys like a plant can you elaborate on the"}

lot like serotonin and it tickles that is it binds nearly selectively to a specific serotonin receptor and it seems to create more what we call resting state lateral connectivity which means more brain areas connected to other brain areas or at least talking to those brain areas after the psilocybin Journey as it's called as opposed to before now these Journeys and I have done them as an adult um I did this as part of a clinical trial did was participated in a psilocybin trial and I participated in MDMA trial um they can be terrifying while they're happening but often there's great Insight um from those experiences provided the right support is provided and it's they always say set and setting so I'm not providing all these like caveats about safety for for no reason or to protect me I'm saying to protect you I mean it it can be it was for me absolutely terrifying and then you do it again as part of these trials the second time I'm like okay this time moment is going to be good going boom terrifying it was a horrible but I learned a lot and there does seem to be an anti-depressant effect I wasn't clinically diagnosed with depression but prior to that but or after thank goodness but I think what we're seeing with these compounds and from my own experience if I may is that they allow us to see relationships between events of past and present and hopefully anticipate certain actions and changes into the future while experiencing the fullness of the emotionality of those experiences in real time so as somebody who's done an immense amount of therapy um I can tell you that I I find Great Value in talk therapy I do um especially of the I think what's called Insight oriented psychoanalysis or or Psychotherapy doesn't have to be classic psychoanalysis not just support you need that not just Rapport you need that but insight as well is is the goal those three things but one of the issues is unless you get on the phone with your therapist or you talk to them in person in a moment where something is really acute like it's really getting you right at that moment sad or happy or whatever it may be it's hard to experience the fullness of that issue in that moment while also parsing it cognitively and it does seem that the psychedelics and to some extent MDMA allow people to get into the full amplitude maybe even enhanced amplitude emotionality of an experience and at the same time allow people to reflect and with the help of a so-called guide or the the therapist take notes in a way that lead to specific actionable outcomes and I think that's the real value you can get realtime experience with insight and of course you need need support as well and of course set and setting and safety are absolutely key so psilocybin seems to do that in one manner MDMA does it in a different way MDMA by the way we we know dramatically increases serotonin and dopamine but it seems to be the serotonergic effect that um is responsible for most of its therapeutic effect by the way MDMA is methylene dioxy methampetamine which isn't necessarily saying that it's bad what's actually interesting is that MDMA ecstasy provided that it's pure and in the appropriate dosage range does not seem to be neurotoxic as it once was thought to be the paper claiming that was retracted they accidentally were giving the subjects in that study uh Beth amphetamine not MDMA and right yes right and they retracted the paper but nobody talks about that paper but do you know it's kind of interesting do you know where the um most of the data on the lack of toxicity of MDMA comes from there's a a beautiful set of studies that were carried out on subjects who were exclusively from the church of latterday saints sometimes referred to as Mormons right Mormons are an excellent test population for a study like that because they don't do other drugs but MDMA is not on the no-fly list so apparently according to these papers and by the way I have a lot of friends who are LDS and they're they're wonderful people the according to the these papers which I believe because they're published and peer reviewed and they still are in the literature you can find subjects in that Community not all of LDS are taking LDS folks are taking actually I don't think but presumably no but people who have taken anywhere from one to two to 50 to over a 100 doses of MDMA in a short period of time and aside from a mild deficit in in attention and the people who have taken the large doses or frequent doses that is they there do not seem to be many cognitive deficits um that are detectable and certainly no um apparent neurotoxicity which is not to say go do MDMA as much as you like I think there is the potential for neurotoxicity if it's taken too often and things of that sort so a lot to still figure out but MDMA um seems to have a slightly different um trajectory of than psilocybin it tends to be less um scary um although it it is very sympathetic uh arousing that is so people can get afraid or if the elevated heart rate Etc but the empathogenic component is really interesting because ultimately with PTSD it's really about developing empathy for one's self it's really about developing empathy for oneself and resolving one of the core issues of trauma which is often not discussed which is that at an unconscious level at an unconscious level trauma seems to be a confusion to the nervous system about who's responsible so that even if somebody knows and understands hey that was them they're the perpetrator I'm the victim somehow the nervous system gets confused about responsibility in a way that leads to triggering of some of the the negative feelings around that event or events as the case may be and MDMA seems to be able to intervene in that confusion and shortcircuit that confusion through this self-empathy self-empathy is something that I think um deserves more exploration in the years to come so lots happening there in the United States MDMA is um now being registered with the FDA for um for additional perhaps for legalization right now it's it is still illegal so if you take any of what I said tonight and go buy MDMA I'm not at fault okay getting in the sa about two hours before going to sleep really improves my"}

always nice it's always nice to meet people and this kid walks up to me this was in Melbourne in the in the gym like this has never happened to me before it was really cool he just walks up he goes hey Andrew I'm like cool like he just said that's it and he just walked away I was like right like I like cool and I was like that kid is so mellow it was really cool like I was like we would have been friends actually friends with all the wild ones but it was a really interesting phenotype again human phenotypes fascinate me so if we run into each other on the street and I ask your name and we talk I'm genuinely interested I'm not studying you I'm not taking notes or data but people are so different but hey Andrew okay so maybe it's him hey Andrew hey aie I found that I'm able to focus far better when I bounce my legs up and down while sitting on the balls of my feet what's going on you got a lot of energy that's what's going on no I think you know um there isn't a ton of science on this but it's very clear as I mentioned earlier that people have different um spontaneous movement rates and some people people you know some people are a little bit more jittery um if you look if you go into a uh a classroom of young children see them sitting around boys and girls let's say somewhere between 4 and 6 often times you'll notice that some of the kids can sit extremely still and then some of the kids are like really like and there is a chromosomal difference there the boy it's known that that boys have a slower development of the so-call top down inhibition from the forbrain that the prefrontal cortex which frankly we hear about over and over again many podcasts a lot of description of prefrontal Cortex its main job the best description I've ever heard of it anyway is from a friend who's a neurosurgeon at neurolink who came up through my lab Matt McDougall he's been on the podcast he the the job of the prefrontal cortex is to send connections to the rest of the brain and say basically to the appropriate circuit so it's that's why people of the pre with damage to the prefrontal cortex for any reason or degeneration of the prefrontal cortex find themselves doing things or we find them doing things that are a little bit context inappropriate and in some cases dramatically inappropriate but in most cases just kind of context inappropriate they don't suppress Behavior very well so you know it may be that a certain level of autonomic arousal brings us into that optimal you know some people call it a flow State a flow state is a little bit of a nebulous thing I mean I have great respect for Steven Cotler and those that have talked about and written about flow but what I really can just say about flow as it relates to Neuroscience is that like backwards that spells wolf like we don't really know that much more about like the neural basis of a flow state but for each of us we have these kind of tunnels that we like to be in um where we find that our level of focus and action is just right and so I I I don't think I'm going too far out on a limb here how you by saying that if you if you find that you focus best when you can dispel a little bit of that um energy by moving your body that you're able to do your your best work that makes sense to me I I don't do them so much anymore but for years I would do you know surgeries lots and lots of surgeries down the microscope dissecting retinas dissecting retinas like if you got an eyeball I can dissect it I'm good at it um I can do them in my sleep and I would find that if I had a little bit too much energy that the forceps would jiggle a little bit and it wasn't a caffeine thing and a friend of mine who's a worldclass neurosurgeon Eddie Chang is chair neurosurgery at UCSF he's been on the podcast he said ah there's a solution to that that we learn in neurosurgery they're like the astronauts of medicine he said you know you tap your foot I thought oh that's kind of cool why would that work he said well basically you've got some sort of anticipatory activity in an area of the brain called the basil ganglia which is involved in these go noo type actions like all of our actions are yes go and noo don't do something else so flexor extensor this all kind of stuff very complicated but seamless for most most people and when you have a bit too much anticipatory activity you're getting ready to go like a like a sprinter out the blocks and you're you know you're doing something that's very important like a brain surgery in his case or you know microsurgery in my case for research purposes that if you your activation state is too high that you can dispel some of that energy by just simply tapping your foot or doing some sort of rhythmic activity with another part of your body appropriate to that context of course okay last question don't know hey Andrew yeah oh oh they skipped that one I guess that's the new thing I'll never forget when I got my lab for the first time you know I came up in an era when it was still pretty formal Neuroscience you like you'd say hey professor so and so and then they say you can call me Barbara and I'm like hey Barbara but before that no one you know need hey or that and I'll never forget that in my lab one my first graduate student who's now a professor he's very very talented scientist at the University of Utah and I got a text from him that just said she called me Andy she said hey Andy when are you going to buy us an espresso maker it was like the second day and I was like whoa times have changed so I think it's good I think the lack of formality is actually good at first I was like wait a second I waited my whole life to become a professor and now it's hey Andy but I think you know W with with the years I've realized

for the next two and a half hours no I'm kidding the uh I'm not known for being succinct I didn't go over too much earlier so okay so uh ground truths so let's start with ground truths and then let's move to um emerging let's maybe get to a little bit of speculation let's avoid conjecture um ground truths um blood circulation is good for the brain perhaps most important for the brain so anything that is good for cardiovascular health is going to be good for brain health it's not the only thing but that's true we know this so you hear these days a lot about Zone 2 cardio I don't know who gets credit for that petera talks a lot about it I talk a lot about it none of us invented the notion but you know 150 probably more like 180 to 200 minutes of so-called Zone 2 cardio per week is good numbers to shoot for some of us get more some of us less what is Zone 2 cardio Zone 2 cardio is um cardiovascular exercise could be running could be swimming could be walking depending on your level of Fitness which you can just barely maintain a conversation were you to push any harder or faster you wouldn't be able to complete your sentences with much ease okay so is this zone two cardio for me no but if I were to jog and try and have a conversation at some point I would have a little bit of a hard time that's Zone 2 cardio um so we know that's true why uh well it seems to do a number of things at the level of release of growth factors brain dve neutrophic Factor at the level of um different let's call them I realize the immunologists are going to like roll their eyes but um anti-inflam flammatory cyto kindes and things of that sort you also have inflammatory cyto kindes um and things of that sort um it does seem that increasing blood flow in and through the brain is important for brain health which is not all that surprising there are species of animals that spend part of their life swimming about and then when they stop um a good port and stick to a rock or something good portion of the nervous system actually degenerates but neurod degeneration and dementia are not necessar neily the same thing and this is something that we don't often hear about um the age related decline in memory capacity in particular working memory can be related to reductions in dopamine Transmission in the brain so things that increase the catacol amines that we talked about earlier um this could be pharmacology of course but it doesn't have to be pharmacology it could be um anything that increases the camines um and we talk about this on the podcast we have zeroc cost protocols that you don't have have to sign up for you can just go to our website and go to dopamine regulation and it will list out ways to increase the catac colomines through zero cost and very lowcost ways are known to improve working memory working memory of course the capacity to maintain a string of numbers or information for sake of kind of immediate goals but not information that's passed to the longer term memory so that's that's different than neurod degeneration that's simply reductions in the amount of neuromodulators like dopamine being deployed as we get older so modul modulating dopamine through healthy ideally uh means but I do think we are going to see an increase in the use of selective pharmacology for this purpose and here I'm not recommending anyone do drugs or take drugs prescription or otherwise but it does seem that um certain compounds like nicotine believe it or not um even though it increases vasil constriction and blood pressure um Can offs set some of the age related reductions in dopaminergic and coleric aceto Coline coleric transmission um and you know you don't want to smoke Vape dip or snuff I'm not even recommending people take Zin patches but I think um there is some use cases for uh nicotine provided you're doing it with the you know a your physician knows and you're not getting into blood pressure dangerous blood pressure range or supplementation with choline donors and things of that sort to increase acetylcholine and dopamine some people are starting to take things like modafanil and adol in older age um but keep in mind these are not modaal but adderal liant Etc these are amphetamines they're amphetamines so I'm not recommending this but I think that's where we're headed I think you're going to see a number of different cognitive enhancers that are used to offset some age related um uh cognitive decline AKA dementia now in terms of um so we're going Zone 2 cardio to like prescription drugs we're kind of bracketing here and then behavioral protocols that can increase neuromodulators such as the catac colomines now in terms of um other things that can perhaps decrease the likelihood of Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia as it relates to neurod degeneration um currently there are a lot of do not don't hit your head too hard if you hit it really hard don't hit it again hard um the so-call two hit model literally um you know and and we think of football or I guess rugby that's a sport you guys play down here where they use the head as a battering ram um I've seen this right some big necks on those kids and then it boom and they yeah but the problem is not necessarily just rugby or American football um or a I was told that someone told me I had to shout out an Australian football team and I know it's a setup so I'm not going to do it they're like when you're in Melbourne tomorrow you got to say that your favorite team is blank and I'm like this feels really dangerous um so I'm not going to do it um I'm not going to do it but what's that do it I can't remember the name of the team sorry um but I watched the document what's that um but I still don't understand the rugby thing they do they use the guy's head as or G's head as a battering ram cuz I they used to play you see outside the my lab we had this big field and my Bulldog loved watching he was like this this sport makes sense but um they were just like run and then the I I never understood it but anyway what's that got it I need a translator sorry so I need a translator um but I love the enthusiasm um yeah so we think about um head injuries and brain injuries mostly in the context of sport but that's not where most the head injuries occur most of them occur construction workers car accidents TBI things of that sort um there's some interesting data on hyperbaric chambers this is getting really into the you know kind of high level stuff here meaning most people don't have access to them I I look forward to learning more these are playing with different concentrations of oxygen in a little micro environment for traumatic brain injury um and neurod deener ation I mean do I think in 5 years that everyone's going to be sitting in hyperbaric chambers order to offset neuron loss probably not I think it's not coste effective but um I will say that most of the things that are good for the body are good for the brain um keeping kind of anything that plaques the arteries capillaries and veins of the brain because it's so heavily vascularized um minimal and and minding those neuromodulators um obviously drugs of abuse like methamphetamine can deplete dopamine neurons the data on MDMA by the way I don't know there's drug enforcement in the room um the data you know where they have most of the safety data or lack of safety data in some cases on MDMA keep in mind MDMA ecstasy is methylene dioxy methampetamine methamphetamine we know causes neurod degeneration no question it also causes bad teeth do you know how do you know how turns people into mouth breathers dry mouth and the teeth degenerate yeah we have an episode on oral health coming out this this is real that's actually why the teeth degenerates from excessive um dry and it limits saliva production saliva is very important for remineralization of the teeth they shout out to the dentist in the house so the the the thing about MDMA is interesting because it turns out that MDMA because it also it increases dopamine just as methamphetamine does remember MDMA methylene dioxy methamphetamine but also huge increases in serotonin seem to be most most of the effect of MDMA the kind of empathogenic effect um there was a study done of um people from the LDS latterday Saints sometimes referred to as Mormons um why was a study on MDMA done with people from the LDS community and I don't want to imply that everyone from the LDS Community does MDMA but why they're very interesting um test population because they don't do other drugs but for some reason dma is not on the nfly list so there's is it's a beautiful paper um in which they took people who had only done as any drug not even taking caffeine right either once or semi frequent or very frequent use of MDMA and they did a bunch of cognitive testing and there were some attention issues when people had taken over what was a couple hundred doses of of MDMA at the 80 milligram dose or more but doesn't seem to be much neurod degeneration which is not to say that it's all safe there is an abuse and addictive potential there the biggest issue seems to be contamination of batches if we have a feny issue in the US I I I don't know if it's happening down here as well very concerning okay so the point here is that I think very soon you're going to hear about drugs prescription drugs and supplements to augment the release of neuromodulators not for sake of empathogenic states or psychedelic States but to try and keep those dopaminergic neurons online to offset dementia because that's what the question is about in fact there's a Nobel prize winning neuroscientist at Columbia University whose name I won't tell you or maybe I will who when I went to visit his office chewed no fewer than five pieces of Nicorette in the course of a half an hour and I'm like what's going on he got a Nobel Prize but this looks kind of pathologic and I said why and he said well the nicotine is to offset age related loss of dopaminergic and coleric neurons I thought really he's like yeah when I quit smoking because I want lung cancer but this is him this is anic data I'm not sugesting you do this I think there are a number of things that we can do but protect those neuromodulators keep perfusion that is blood flow to the brain strong there's a a case for cardiovascular exercise and it does seem it really does seem that exercise that engages the neuromuscular connections more than cardiovascular exercise so not just resistance training but anything that invol involves coordinated bodily training learning new physical skills Dance Etc really does seem to offset some of the loss of cognitive fun functioning in adults so it's kind of interesting that physical exercise is great for cognition and probably cognition may or may not help physical ability but one probably can imagine why there's a bidirectional relationship there your nervous system doesn't really distinguish between physical and cognitive it's all working as a bunch of functional units I could go on and on about this but um hopefully that um at least gets your um the gears turning around some things that perhaps you've heard about and some things that you haven't and we'll do an episode on dementia and offsetting dementia in order to get into some of the fine details okay can we increase our willpower just"}

glad that you mentioned the amcc I think of all the new areas of Neuroscience research um that are out there I think the anterior mid singulate cortex is one of the most interesting um structures and and areas of research nowadays you know I think I if I have my way then not only will most people have heard of dopamine and the amydala I guess you need a Star Wars character named after your brain part um isn't there one right I only saw the first three I'm of that generation but isn't there a Amidala or something yeah right don't leave me hang in here is there or not if I'm wrong just say no okay anyway the amydala um thanks the um the amydala is a brain structure that is involved in threat detect ction and Novelty detection not just threats the anterior mid singulate cortex is an area of the brain that we know is activated well let me tell you the best experiment the best experiment was done in my opinion by a neurosurgeon at Stanford Joe pery uh he's probing around in people's brains they got a little piece of skull missing he's stimulating in the brain he's asking them questions how do you feel what's going on how do you feel what's going on and he's got this electrode in the anterior mid singulate cortex and the patient says I feel like something really bad's going to happen like a storm's coming it's like okay well we can stop stimulating he's like no I'm going into the storm like oh that's interesting stimulate a little bit further back just by a millimeter or so completely different subjective experience for the patient that's interesting get a different patient in there map to the enter mid singulate cortex stimulate and the person says I like I'm going to get out of my chair and I'm going to do something hard wild right this is prior to any knowledge of what the interior mid singulate cortex is doing make a long story short people who successfully overcome a physical challenge a cognitive challenge that learn a new skill that um successful dieters I don't really like that term um their interor mid signate cortex grows or becomes more active under conditions that challenge the inter mid singulate cortex so this brain region seems to be the the brain region that puts us in a forward Center of mass physically and sort of cognitively and emotionally I often like to think that you know the nervous system as sophisticated as it is and psychology as sophisticated as it is as it is excuse me can be bined into kind of three categories things that we like to eat or don't like to eat or can kind of be bended into yum yuck or me that's kind of what the the nervous system has to do because ultimately you have to decide do I want to go toward it so-call repetitive Behavior do I want to get away from it do nothing people were either like yum or some cases yum yuck or in some cases like or like me right yum y me yum yum me this is the the sort of three tributaries that we have the option of moving down not moving down or moving away from so the enter mid singulate cortex because it has inputs from so many different areas and outputs to so many different areas it can access circuits related to dopamine norepinephrine it can access circuits related to memory and context it's a hub it's a hub that by All Views through all lenses of the existing research suggests that when we anytime we do something truly challenging in particular things that we do not enjoy this is key the an mid singulate cortex undergo some sort of plasticity everything's in the research data now point to the idea that the inter mid singulate cortex is the seat of so-called willpower which is linked to Concepts like tenacity or grit and Etc and what I love about this research is that it comes from a bunch of different areas human brain Imaging brain stimulation Etc here's what I don't like about the reality but that we all need to accept which is that the anterior mid singulate cortex is modifiable by experience by leaning into challenges at any stage of life that's great we talked about that earlier plasticity but lest we forget plasticity goes in the other direction too it seems that when we don't engage in challenges that the an mid singulate cortex it doesn't atrophy but it undergoes sort of a downshift in activation now here's what's really really interesting in relates to the previous question the anter mid singulate cortex seems to be especially active at Baseline and available for plasticity in what are called superagers superagers you know we've all heard of blue zones the superagers are these people who they don't just exist in blue zones they're spread around the world these are people that seem at least by cognitive measures and other physiological measures of the body seem to age extremely slowly so they shouldn't really be called superagers right they should be called super non aers anyway the anid singulate cortex seems to be hyperactive in these superagers as they're called and so it seems that not only do they maintain cognitive function later in life but that seems to be related to their regular engagement in challenging things so remember for so many years years we heard okay like nuns don't get dementia and then there's all sorts of things you can imagine could be related to that and then we're thinking oh maybe it's crossword puzzles maybe it's crossword puzzles maybe it's hanging out with other people maybe and you know and then you know that person down the street and she cycling on the weekends like crazy and she's 90 and she looks like she's 50 and she's sharp as attack it's probably leaning into Challenge on a regular basis leaning into Challenge on a regular basis as opposed to one specific cognitive or physical thing which means that if you love cycling or you love the cold plunge or you love a certain form of exercise it's probably not doing that much for your anterior mid singulate cortex but these super agers also live longer and so there is this notion that because the anterior mid singulate cortex has connectivity to a lot of areas of the brain and body that it is somehow linked to the will to live and this is being examined now in so-called terminal cancer patients so-called you you know terminal cases I don't like the language because there are these amazing instances and Physicians and oncologists have known this for a long time that when people decide they're going to fight cancer they don't always win that fight unfortunately but often times it's the people who insist on fighting it psychologically that they won't give in that end up still living more months more years and in some cases putting the cancer into remission with of course other tools right I'm not saying you shouldn't use other tools to combat cancer it's a very interesting structure relates to the question on dementia hopefully that was uh informative Julian thank you how would you recommend shift"}

schedules?", "doc_id": "ttNxNbqNQK4_3", "video_id": "ttNxNbqNQK4", "video_title": "LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman Question & Answer in Melbourne, AU", "video_header": "Minimizing Circadian Disruption for Shift Workers", "segment_idx": "3", "time_start": "22:41", "time_end": "29:16", "context": "workers minimize the effects of disruption to their circadian rhythm oh this is so important you know why because like right now 92 uh 9:40 p.m. we're kind of doing shift work right now most people are on a shift work schedule now in the world this is true we think of shift workers as only the people who are up in the middle of the night sleeping during the day but most people are doing shift work the criteria for shift work is at least a 2hour varant at least in the US a two-hour variance in the sleep wake cycle more than three nights a week anyone here go to sleep every night same time wake up every morning the same time never stay up later than that more than two nights a week okay most people are doing shift work nowadays they're just on their phone or they're on their computer and I'm not going to argue that's NE you know you shouldn't uh and many times that's me as well so here's what we do know and I could we did whole episode on shift work but I'll try and summarize some of the key points you want to have your cortisol elevated early in the day and then subside across the day that's the ideal pattern of cortisol release cortisol is a great thing when it's high and then tapers off from early day into the later day it's a bad thing if that cortisol Peak is shifted late that cortisol Peak is coming every 24 hours you don't have a choice question is is it going to be early day or is it going to be late day late day cortisol is Peaks are associated with depression anxiety this was done by my colleague David Spiegel and the great Robert spolski at Stanford a study about that Robert another great beard amazing and and and I I always thought it was to blend in with the species that he studies cuz he was like the baboon guy you know I haven't quite figured out how to master that one you know like the Cuttlefish look but the um working on it working on it maybe I just have to no never mind there's a there's a story about you heard remember the earlier story The the made anyway the cuttle fish anyway never mind um again this is why I don't like to speak too late in the day I get myself into trouble but um the point here um is that having that cortisol Peak early in the day sets you up for mood focus and alertness immune system function and really um in a really great way shift workers have a serious problem which is that late peaks in cortisol are kind of Paramount in all forms of shift work and so what you need to do is to put yourself ideally in lighting conditions that limit the amount of blue light coming in at night or when you're doing that shift work now you have to do your work and I think in the next two years if I have my way one one idea that I'd like to of embed in people's minds is you you know we hear a lot now about how hyper processed foods and highly processed foods are bad for us sort of empty calories what are empty calories it's foods that are very calorie dense but micronutrient poor right that's what it it really is it's also the quality of food issues and people get you know like let's please not have the seed oil debate it's like people get really into this and it's unclear to me still and okay but we we sort of think of empty calories like alcohol sugar Etc calorie dense micronutrient poor light can be viewed in much the same way these days we live in a very blue light Rich World lot of blue light so short wavelength light blue light UV light and by the way in sunlight especially down here it's very UV Rich blue which is great during the day especially when it's offset or or sorry when it includes long wavelength light full spectrum light by the way for everyone that's obsessed with red light and I love red light and red light therapies remember the best source of red light is the sun it's full spectrum light it includes red it's just there's a bunch of other stuff in there too see it doesn't look like a Red Light Panel um that said if you are going to do shift work one of the best things you can do it's been shown to reduce cortisol levels at night while you're doing that shift work is to filter out some of the blue so that is a use case for blue blockers or even for glasses that put you into more reddish conditions provided you can still do the work work you need to do safely you will see a dramatic reduction in cortisol under those conditions this blue and UV pathway picked up by a certain set of neurons in the eye the intrinsically photosensitive melanops and cells Etc is a real thing and it and it's designed to activate you this is why so-called Seasonal effective disorder lamps sad lamps are basically bright blue whsh light so when you're doing that shift work if you can get into red or orange or light conditions if that's great you can do this very inexpensively by the way by just getting some party lights it doesn't have to be any fancy red light this is we're not talking about red light panels the other thing of course is when you get back to your nonwork environment you need to do some work to think about when is best to sleep when is not best to sleep you know is it best to sleep all day and be up all night or get that sunlight in the morning and I talk about that in the shift work episode and I'm tempted to go down that rabbit hole now but I would just encourage you to take a look at that episode and um I'll just cue you all to a resource the hubman lab.com webbsite allows you thanks to our wonderful Engineers to put in multiple topics so you could say shift work red light or shift work dopamine or shift work sunlight and it will take you to the exact time stamps across all the episodes where those specific topics occur is all zero cost as opposed to having to go and peruse all these different episodes you a lot of people have said why not shorter episodes it's like well the idea was to create a library of information that now ai is and better engineering of websites can allow you to just pull the relevant information just like you would a book I used to go with the library for those of you like me old enough to remember he actually took this thing called a book off a shelf he Xerox copied it in any event he very archaic and very expensive and you'd always get the margin of the book in the middle like the the spine it sucked now you can go to the website and just get that information and then we also just launched an ai. huberman lab.com webbsite again as all zero cost you can say hey what should I do for shift work but I wanted you here to come here tonight so I didn't tell you that until you got here no I'm just kidding I'm just kidding okay um and there are a few other tools about adjusting eating schedules for and what not for shift work but um hopefully that gets you going um Julia thank you what's the"}

"segment_idx": "4", "time_start": "29:24", "time_end": "37:31", "context": "difference between nsdr and meditation um thank thank you for this question I am a huge huge huge believer and proponent and practitioner of nsdr nonsleep deep rest what is non-sleep deep rest well to be fair Yoga Nidra which translates to yoga sleep is a thousand-year-old practice um thousands of years little practice in which you lie completely still keep the Mind awake you're not thinking in a structured way it's more of a body scan directed relaxation Etc I discovered this in 2015 when I was doing some research for a book that I still can't manage to seem to finish on trauma and addiction and I went I have a friend very talented trauma therapist who's managed to help people with all sorts of addictions he'll be on the podcast in the not to distant future and I went down to this clinic in Florida and everyone there spent the first hour of the day doing Yoga Nidra this is pretty wacky I was still in my pure science quote unquote pure scientist naive scientist lens and I thought what is this about and he said well you know so much of addiction is about an inability to regulate impulses um to deal with agitation especially in the early days of trying to get sober or being sober and it just helps people learn to regul self-direct the their nervous system in terms of relax self-directed relaxation it also seems to help with their sleep it also has these components about time and and and sort of if you because he said you know it's kind of interesting if you take a step back you know if you can tolerate craving for a second you just did it so why couldn't you do it for another second why could you do it for another second another second it's not as if it necessarily increases linearly or over time so you know what's going on and so again sort of our ability to realize and regulate our states across time and to realize there's this funny thing where when we feel terrible we think it's going to go on forever and when we're happy we we were like certain it's going to stop there's a kind of asymmetry in our nervous system that we don't understand we showed he started talking about yoga NRA really seems to help addicts recover and stay sober if they do it regularly thought well this is cool what is it I'm a neuroscientist we started studying in my laboratory we discovered that the brain goes into these States during yoga NRA that are similar to sleep body still mind alert and that seems to be very beneficial maybe even accelerates neuroplasticity and learning and indeed there's evidence for that there's evidence that yoga at from a laboratory out of Scandinavia not my laboratory showing that it can increase dopamine levels in the striatum basil ganglia by up to 60% using human positron emission tomography Imaging so we're talking about how to increase dopamine through non pharmacologic means this something about body still brain active very very powerful way to do that I I made up this term This Acronym non-sleep deep rest because I have tremendous respect for Yoga Nidra and the the yoga Traditions but I was concerned for a lot of people un unfortunately when they hear Yoga Nidra the it sounds esoteric and they're not going to approach that practice also Yoga Nidra includes intentions and some things that are a little bit on the mystical side and I knew I was going to take some heat for it and I feel badly about it but that bad feeling is offset by I think when you call something non-sleep deep rest it tells you what it is and then more people are likely to come to the practice and I felt like it was worth you know kind of putting myself you know jumping on the grenade for that one so non-sleep deep rest is very effective at restoring cognitive and physical Vigor and can indeed offset some degree of sleep loss it also gets you better at falling and staying asleep and it's very simple and very easy to do and it's zero cost and if you want to try it you can go on to YouTube and put nsdr in my last name there's a woman named Kelly boy boys who has a much more pleasant voice than mine um who does them as well these are all zeroc cost protocols she's also in the waking up app um and there are many of them common deai as another person who has you know Wonderful yoganidra scripts so you can find these things and they're really about 10 minutes to 20 minutes sometimes 30 minutes long you can do it for an hour but most people won't do that consistently you don't have to do them every day and they're very very effective at restoring mental and physical Vigor when you're feeling depleted and it getting you to be a better sleeper so I figure that's a zeroc cost tool that is grounded in good mechanistic science and makes sense logically so why not meditation typically and if and there many different forms of meditation but if you're let's just say kind of um standard if there were such a thing um third eye meditation closing your eyes focusing your concentration on a point just sort of at your forehead concentrating on breathing redirecting your attention to your breathing if it if your attention drifts we know based on work from Wendy Suzuki's laboratory at New York University and some work out of the University of Wisconsin can improve memory can improve focus and does seem to have some stress offsetting effects but it's more of a focus exercise as opposed to an energy replenishing exercise now some people meditate and feel better afterwards they have more energy but then it's sort of like well compared to what um I don't think that's the maor effect of meditation and while we're on these topics I should just say that self-directed hypnosis of the sort that my colleague David Spiegel studies is more about solving a particular problem so hypnosis is more about engaging neuroplasticity remember earlier we said that neuroplasticity in adulthood can be activated by Focus followed by rest it seems that in the self-directed hypnotic States the brain enters kind of pattern of activity in which neuroplasticity can be accessed more quickly we think because the brain is both focused and relaxed in a particular way merging that focus and rest State and of course the hypnotic script is not about getting you to do crazy things on stage that's stage hypnosis but self-directed hypnosis is for instance smoking sensation by the way that the success with smoking Sensation from hypnosis is far greater than the cessation with smoking from pretty much any other protocol but unfortunately it has the name hypnosis which makes people think about stuff that people do on stage that's kind of wacky so we need a new name for it um because unfortunately names are a problem there there names can be differentiators as opposed to integrators they don't bring PE when people say I'm going to hypnotize you you should try hypnosis people like like yum yuck me they're like yuck so um by the way does everyone here remember how you know if you're highly hypnotizable do you know that the Spiegel eye roll test it's not what teenagers do David Spiegel and his father psychiat discovered the clinical application of hypnosis it's a clinically approved tool there's brain stem neurons that cause elevations and alertness and focus and they're associated with moving the eyes up they're brain stem neurons that close the eyelids and push and essentially Drive the eyes down that are associated with parasympathetic states which why you like this when you're tired you're out there I'm sure if you are capable of keeping your ey your gaze upward and closing your eyelids you score on a particular end of the so-called Spiel eye roll test which makes you highly hypnotizable because that state of hypnosis is one in which you're what alert but very very relaxed so if you go to Spiegel's laboratory they're going to look at you and they say look up at the ceiling and then close your eyelids and if you can still see the whites of if they still see the whites of your eyes as your eyelids close well then you're in the highly hypnotizable realm kind of interesting right there's all nervous system related and you can see this stuff is this is like real clinical tools okay how do we stop ourselves from mindlessly scrolling on our phones hard questions um I didn't look"}

monkey or versus the cloth monkey I mean primates go to the cloth monkey even if they don't get food there I mean it's such a critical component of you know how our nervous system forms um the I think this is a this is a you know what I'm going to do something I've never done before I'm going to turn the question around I actually would I seriously I'm not trying to avoid answering this but you know we've worked on all I've worked on cuttlefish we worked on respiration practices we worked on uh Vision we've worked on neuro regeneration you know I've enjoyed um working on a great number of different things I'm sort of curious what people like what do you think we need more of I've never done this but I really want to know um I don't know how we're going to do this in any kind of non-chaotic format but what the hell um it's late enough in the evening we just do it um like really I mean so now there's trials on psychedelics we do this by kind of like I'll throw out some options and then we'll do it so right now it seems that psychedelics are a big thing um do they increase plasticity yeah I'm excited about it I'm a convert but I do think that one has to be careful and there are certain people in populations like people who um suffer from certain types of manic bipolar or schizophrenia that really need to avoid these things kids I mean being a kid is basically being in a psychedelic State the you know lateral connectivity of the brain is extend ensive um and you know I don't encourage it I mean that the trials with MDMA and PTSD are incredible what's happening with maps is incredible you know 60 plus perc remission rates done with licensed Physicians of course I don't get Cavalier with this so okay so I'll just ask so I mean it's going to be hard to draw out the denters but more work on psychedelics psilocybin Etc as ways to amarate depression are people like more like yum yuck or meh is that like yum okay or like yuck don't be afraid to say yuck I like a good argument is anyone like yuck on psychedelics sorcery it's sorcery I heard that um meh okay all right interesting okay so psychedelics get a strong push I think we have enough evidence that changing patterns of respiration changes brain States but I think that that's an interesting area um I don't know you can you just shout it out just shout it out one all first over here yes oh God the accent you guys are so good I love the accent listen I listen I I don't drink I don't drink anymore but when I used to when I used to go to bars I'll just say the Australian accent never fails um in the US yeah time Chambers time Chambers oh hyperbaric chambers yeah hyper that's an interesting one yeah I mean when I think of ways to modify physiology you think temperature light neurom modulators right you think by the way anytime you want to think about changing something in the body your brain you think mechanical and chemical so this is kind of this is changing the chemistry of the brain and body through hyperbaric chambers thank you appreciate it I think I re did we run into each other at the gym the other day no anyway um think I recognize you I um the okay one I'll get to you in one second yeah yeah love that okay so protocols for childhood trauma yeah so I mean I think we're finally at the place where we as a world where like this word trauma actually is Meaningful like because we knew it before but I think before people thought if like if you hadn't lived in a war zone which obviously is trauma um now I think people appreciate that trauma is inherent to a lot of Life by the way I love your shirt I that shirt it's like yeah a lawn stale shirt was Against Racism hey I love I love that shirt um you know the history of that shirt right it's like lawdale was co-opted by some Neo-Nazi groups as a brand so lawdale came out with an Against Racism and hate shirt which is like the best like to that which is yeah so anyway little side note there not sponsored by lawdale um but rad shirt yeah I think childhood trauma you know trauma can be best defined as an adverse event that changes the nervous system in a way that causes maladaptive functioning going forward it's not every bad thing right but it certainly happens and I think we need to learn to rewire the nervous system let's let's face it whether not psychedelics or it's talk therapy or it's hyperbaric chambers or it's cold plunges what we're talking about is neuroplasticity we're trying to rewire the nervous system so I love that one um we need some very structured um tools there's all sorts of stuff about soaz release for trauma and you know there's little bits like little Sil of things that are all very interesting breath work you know release work but so far there isn't like a structured framework for for treating trauma different groups doing different things EMDR Etc I think they all have Merit okay there was that shouting out cons Consciousness The Big C yeah um in my house Costello was the big ca he would always remind me of that but Consciousness I think that um and now with AI we have to ask ourselves like what is what is conscious and I think we need a clear definition of what that is do you guys know this story of like they were going to solve Consciousness a few years ago and and they didn't do it there was this bet in Neuroscience that um it was going to be solved by 2015 or something like that so I think we need and it's not obviously so we need better definition of what that means but I think it's very important uh problem indeed so thank you maybe a free will yeah that's a tough one that's one I usually avoid um R Robert Robert slammed me on that one on the podcast what was it in the back I heard as an Adaptive technique but oh yeah you know we hear I yeah we hear so much I I'm agreeing with you the um we hear so much about ADHD these days without an understanding of like what it really reflects except in the extreme clinical cases so I think a better understanding I did two episodes of the podcast by the way on a attention in 88 she one focused mainly on behavioral and nutritional tools it was positively received by about half of people and then the other half were like this is garbage what about all the drugs that are useful then I did one about all the drugs that can be useful and people said this is garbage you're putting kids on meth and I'm like wait a second hold on we try and cover it all so um because I I favor balance I heard a excellent things there was were all male voices we kind of got a sampling bias here unless I'm got a high frequency cut off thank you something negotiation sorry science of negotiation yeah so people being able to resolve differences better Lord please yes oh my goodness I mean this is yes thank you um if ever there was a call to action it's like um you know this is a big question right I'm a neuroscientist not a historian not a not a futurist or a politician but um thank goodness can you imagine what a terrible job I would do I like being outdoors I hate meetings I like dressing like this and and I and I don't like the news um it'd be the worst but yeah if ever there was a need and a question it's you know are we just going to continue in these like iterative cycles of like when the economy is good things seem mostly good and then a lot of people are still suffering and then like these cycles of and or are we going to finally just sit back and go okay what are we good at as a species what are we really bad at what are we like kind of good at and start coming up with some tools to try and function better on the whole with the understanding that there are Bad actors out there that are constantly trying to you know exploit and manipulate but there are also a lot of good actors too and by good actors I don't mean actors in the in the stage acting sense I mean I think that um look what we're we're we're a smart species we can think in past present and future terms we can look at mechanism we can communicate better with each other better than any species except maybe the cuddlefish and so I think the question is are we you know is there going to be some sort of sitting back and finally just saying like enough like let's just figure out a way to dialogue and I love that um you know it it's a it's a science we that there are problems and there are hard problems um and honestly I think it's going to come about if it comes about it's going to come about through groups not through individuals I don't think we're going to get like the world leader or world leaders of 12 people like let's get it done let's get it done right this time I think it's going to be a a more Collective Consciousness you know I'd like to see fewer individual leaders and more groups and panels leading things but anyway that's that's my bias and you know um genetics genetics genetics love it yeah okay well there's okay I'll say two things and then I think my team's going to make me close out wait um rad okay awesome now it's turning into like a like a science punk rock show so um the um genetics well I think the big things is in genetics are we're soon going to be in the place where we can do genetic well right now you can take human embryos and Screen them for mutations by whole genome sequencing it's very inexpensive compared to a few years ago it's still expensive and you can do selection you can select out based on lack of mutations maybe even based on over representation of certain genes um that's interesting has some ethical considerations but there soon will be you can do crisper um you could in theory you could modify the Genome of of adults um and certainly babies and so that's where we're headed it's already being done in certain countries it was done in China um it was not looked upon kindly by the International Ethics committees um but it was done a mutation in the in the HIV receptor um so those babies exist so it's happening uh it's going to be interesting times uh the microbiome I think is really exciting here's my big call to action is that there's a microbiome in the gut but there's also microbiome on the skin and the nose and the mouth and the genitals like these all these little niches and well I guess it depends the little or not so little niches um depends um I was thinking about the nostrils um the night's getting long um there I go again um the uh they they are all important and and there's a lot more to understand I think the gut microbiome is just one of the microbiomes so and female hormones certainly important topic it's received far less sadly far less attention than male hormone therapy or um understanding and and things are starting to change there it's been slow yeah yeah there's been it's been can you believe it it was like four only like eight years ago that the National Institutes of Health in the United States was like hey maybe you should start studying female mice too it's like like this I mean we're modern science is very far behind we're very far behind and I think it's a it's a resource issue it's also uh you know there's a bunch of um sociological consider considerations in science anyway I'm trying to change the story there but I'm but one person and you know I hope to live a very long time but you know um should I get hit by a bullet to bus

{"question": "What are some specific lifestyle changes or supplements that can help improve cognitive function and reduce the risk of dementia in older adults, especially for those with physically demanding jobs like firefighters?", "doc_id": "LRM5LutB538_1", "video_id": "LRM5LutB538", "video_title": "LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman Question & Answer in Chicago, IL", "video_header": "What Is Your Best Advice to Keep My Brain Healthy in Old Age?", "segment_idx": "1", "time_start": "2:50", "time_end": "7:05", "context": "is the same advice I give to anybody, which is that, essentially, all of the things that improve cardiovascular health and perfusion of your bodily tissues are going to improve functionality of the brain. Because, of course, the brain is a rich consumer of fuel, requires very good portals to deliver those fuels, and the capillaries, micro capillaries and arteries, and so forth, need to be clean and clear. That's the big one. This is why I think the prescription now is that's generally accepted, and here I'm borrowing from my friend Peter Attia, but about 150, or maybe as much as 200 minutes of so-called zone 2 cardio per week, movement that you can just barely carry out a conversation, is going to be very useful. One thing that's often not discussed is that load bearing exercise of some sort is going to be better, provided your body can tolerate it, but you should do something that you can do consistently over those long durations without injuring yourself. But there's a very interesting literature about how load bearing movements actually generate the release of hormones, yes, hormones, from bone that actually cross the blood-brain barrier and may influence health of neurons in brain areas such as the hippocampus. And there, I'm extending from preclinical data in animals to humans, but there's some human data starting to emerge that that's true. It's also true, and there's a wonderful paper out just today or yesterday from Dr. Andy Galpin's lab and collaborators talking about how if you look at cognitive health, it's highly correlated with things that relate to strength. And that is not to say that you should just do strength training exercises but we know that all people, truly all people, should be doing some sort of resistance training two or three times per week. You know, and we know that grip strength and increasing asymmetry in grip strength between the two hands is one of the indicators of deficits in control from the brain out to the periphery, and it's correlated with cognitive decline. There's also some interesting data about how when the feet become floppy and kind of flaccid or the lack of ability to extend one's toes. I'm still working, I've been wearing this toe spreader thing. Has anyone tried those? Those hurt. Those hurt. I broke this foot a bunch of times. but I'll tell you when you get better at spreading your toes, it's really exciting. And it's really exciting for several reasons. It's really exciting because there's more stability in your feet. You can run and move and do things better without pain. But in addition to that, believe it or not, just as one of the first things that they're going to do when you come into this world is scrape the bottom of your foot and look for the Babinski reflex, which is a neural transmission reflex, as all reflexes are, but it's testing, essentially, the health of the nervous system. That over time, again, there are many correlates of dementia, many, many correlates of dementia, but an inability to finely control the extremities is certainly one of them. So strength training, cardiovascular training, these are kind of stereotyped answers for your question and, yet, those are really the prime movers against cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. And then, of course, I'd be remiss if I didn't throw in something that was a little bit more edgy because that's what I do. There are interesting data about the use of drugs to increase acetylcholine transmission, right? I mean, I was visiting a Nobel Prize winner at Columbia to learn about his incredible work some years ago and saw that he chewed no fewer than five pieces of Nicorette gum, something I don't recommend, during this short meeting. And I said, what is this all about? And he said, well, you know, I don't smoke anymore because I don't want lung cancer. But he said nicotine is protective against Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. I was like, how can that be? And he said, well, you know, decreases in neuromodulation, dopamine, acetylcholine correlated with cognitive decline, keeping your brain sharp, and so on and so forth. So I'm not encouraging people to take nicotine. It increases blood pressure, vasoconstriction, but it's an interesting consideration some of the emerging cholinergic and dopaminergic drugs are ways to increase acetylcholine and dopamine are certainly intriguing. And I won't tell you who that person is but his name is Richard Axel. Next question. Yeah. How can I optimize sleep while working 24/7 hour shifts as a firefighter, 24 hours on 48 hours off?"}
{"question": "How can I establish a consistent sleep schedule while working 24-hour shifts to minimize the negative effects on my health and well-being?", "doc_id": "LRM5LutB538_2", "video_id": "LRM5LutB538", "video_title": "LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman Question & Answer in Chicago, IL", "video_header": "How Can I Optimize Sleep While Working 24 Hour Shifts?", "segment_idx": "2", "time_start": "7:13", "time_end": "10:12", "context": "OK. And this probably also pertains to new parents, and it probably also pertains to anyone that's going through a particularly stressful time, where you're micro waking throughout the night, so not just firefighters. So what do we know? We know, based on really good data, that shift work is bad for us. It's just bad. We're a diurnal species. We're not nocturnal. But thank you, thank you, thank you, shift workers, because you essentially keep us all safe and make the world go round. And so we need you, and we want you healthy. So one of the main things is that you can make sure that you stay on the same sleep-wake schedule, excuse me, for at least two weeks. It's the swing shift that's really the worst. You can tell your boss I said that. And if they won't agree, and you're doing this 24 hour on 24 hour off, there are a couple of things that are really important. First of all, the main way to wake up your nervous system, even though it might not feel like a triple espresso is going to be that light exposure to the eyes. And if you can't get it from sunlight is going to be from any bright, artificial light. I'm not a huge proponent of the daylight simulators. They're very expensive. You can simply buy a 900 lux led far more inexpensively. I don't have any relationship to any company that sells these but you can find them on Amazon or wherever you happen to prefer to purchase things. Or you can just get really close to a bright light. Anytime you're trying to wake up, even if you don't feel that it helps you wake up very much, mostly for the melatonin suppression, because bright light will very acutely suppress melatonin. And then the real question from shiftworkers always seems to be, should I catch up on sleep or is that going to be problematic? Should I just stay up into the next cycle? And the answer there is a little bit nuanced, but the best answer I can give across the board is, if this is a pattern that you're going to be in regularly, over say months or years, then get whatever sleep you can. Get whatever sleep you can. If it's something that you're doing somewhat acutely, like you're traveling to Europe and you're just going to force yourself to stay up a day and a half then, in that case, I would say, no need to get the maximum amount of sleep. Just try and stay with the local schedule. We have an entire episode about shift work that somehow maybe didn't get as much recognition as it should have for shift workers, and we'll try and get it out in better form. We don't always succeed in top carding things in a way that gets them out to the most people. One thing I will say is an opportunity to announce that our website, hubermanlab.com, is completely revamped so it's highly searchable. It will take you to exact timestamps, and now you can segregate out timestamps from newsletters, from all this stuff. So thanks to a lot of effort by my amazing team, you can now navigate that site to real precision. So if you want to say ADHD, Adderall, kids, yes, no, for instance, it will take you to precise timestamps that will address those issues. Next question, please."}
{"question": "What are the potential benefits and limitations of using self-directed hypnosis as a tool for achieving relaxation and accessing a state of heightened focus and attention?", "doc_id": "LRM5LutB538_3", "video_id": "LRM5LutB538", "video_title": "LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman Question & Answer in Chicago, IL", "video_header": "How Does Hypnosis Therapy Work?", "segment_idx": "3", "time_start": "10:17", "time_end": "17:10", "context": "How does hypnosis therapy work? Well, this is a very interesting topic to me because my colleague, Associate Chair of Psychiatry at Stanford, David Spiegel, is a world expert in hypnosis and its neural underpinnings and its use for clinical applications. His father was a hypnotist, also a psychiatrist. And when people hear hypnotism, they think of stage hypnotism and being up on stage and doing things you don't want to in front of other people. But really, it's when we're talking about clinical applications or wellness applications of hypnosis, we're talking about self-directed hypnosis. I really wish there was a better name, because I don't think hypnosis is going to advance very far as a field, frankly, because everyone thinks hypnosis. And it would be like if psychedelics were just called drugs, right? We were taught in the 80s that drugs are bad, and that your brain on drugs looks like an omelet, and that's bad. And if you like omelets, they're still bad. And drugs of abuse are bad. And, actually, I hope we can talk briefly about psychedelics at some point, because I do think there's a little bit of a runaway train around the topic of psychedelics now. I think we need to be very careful how we approach that entire landscape. But hypnosis essentially works by allowing someone to place their own brain into this very unique state. Earlier, we were talking about neuroplasticity, and we talked about the fact that neuroplasticity involves intense focus followed by deep rest in the form of deep sleep or non-sleep deep rest, maybe even Rick Rubining it and just kind of like laying there. Hypnosis is different because hypnosis is a state in which your focus is very narrow, the context is very narrow, but you're very, very relaxed. So maybe the Rubin example of being brain active and body very still is a bit more like hypnosis, to be fair. Why would it be the case that David Spiegel and his dad have literally a tool that is approved by the Psychiatric Association, the major American Psychiatric Association, where they can figure out how hypnotizable you are by having look up and try and close your eyelids while continuing to look up, the so-called Spiegel eye roll test. Sounds pretty wacky, right? This is like TikTok level wacky. Well, the reason is you have cranial nerves, so they sit more or less near your neck, that allow you to direct your focus, your eyes, upward, and then you have cranial nerves that have your eyes go down and the ones that the cranial nerves that drive your eyes up are associated with alertness and eyes open. No surprise. And the cranial nerves that are associated with pointing your eyes down and closing your eyelids are associated with, what, with drowsiness, sleep, and lack of alertness. There's sort of a push-pull in the autonomic nervous system. And Spiegel, Spiegel's daddy and him, figured out, because they're geniuses, that if somebody can maintain upward gaze while closing their eyelids, two things happen. One, you'll see the whites of their eyes, and it's pretty creepy. Two, that means they're highly hypnotizable, because that is a reflection of the probability that they can enter a brain state in which they are both very awake and very relaxed. Pretty cool. Now, if that sounds kind of wacky, because you're just looking at the periphery, keep in mind, that one of the primary entry points for diagnosing concussion is to shine a light in one eye and have that pupil constrict and then see whether or not the other pupil constricts, the so-called consensual pupillary reflex. Although, technically, and I've been bothered by this from day one, it should be called the non-consensual pupil reflex, because the other eye doesn't have a choice if everything's working. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] In any case, if you have a hard hit to the head, you'll see that you shine light in one eye, the pupil constricts, and the other one stays really dilated. And then you go, OK, get this person to the emergency room because there's been a severing of the connections between the two sides of the brain. So looking in the eyes and trying to deduce what might be happening more centrally within the caverns of the skull and the brain is not a new thing. It is a primary diagnostic tool in neurology. It's also how your parents knew that you were taking drugs when you came in the door because your pupils were like that big, and that reflects a difference in autonomic arousal. And, basically, stimulants, as, most dilate their pupils. This is also why the story about belladonna, people intentionally dilating their pupils to trick people into thinking that they were attracted to them. I've thought about this one a lot, too. It's like not a precursor to good relationship. It's like someone's using their physiology to pretend that they're attracted so the other person thinks that they're attracted so that they might become attracted. Anyway, it's a recipe for failure, almost as bad as most of the dating apps. Well, I wouldn't know. I'm not one them, but from what I hear. OK. So where were we? Hypnosis. When you are in a state of elevated attention but very relaxed, guess what, neuroplasticity occurs much faster because you're essentially marrying the two states that are normally divorced, which are heightened levels of attention first and then deep rest. You're essentially putting the nervous system into a more, I wouldn't call it hypoplastic state, but a more plastic state. And for people that are highly hypnotizable, the success rates at, for instance, smoking cessation, pain relief, are pretty impressive. Spiegel Lab has published a number of these. So I think self hypnosis is a very interesting tool. I just hope that they rename it so that it stands a chance of getting off the ground. I mean, one of the things that you learn as a public facing educator is that what things are called has a great impact on whether or not they achieve any kind of use in the world. Hence, why I decided to swallow the difficult pill of partially renaming yoga nidra as non-sleep deep rest. I don't like to do that. Yoga nidra has more than 1,000 year history. But when people hear yoga nidra, unless they are very open minded, they hear magic carpet. They hear levitation, and it's unfortunate, and that's not how I feel. But for years, I talked about yoga nidra, it's so cool. It's like a sleep state but it's-- they're like, yeah, like yoga nidra. OK. But if you come from a culture where that's discussed, they're all about it. And so non-sleep deep rest, you know, I felt like, all right, leave my name out of it. You know, I'll be dead eventually. I mean, I'm in this line of advisors, right? I'm like approaching 50. I'm like, I'm winning in my lineage. But should I be fortunate enough to live past bullet cancer or car crash far enough, then NSDR hopefully will persist, and I don't need a piece of it. It's just the hope is that people will learn to put themselves into brain states that can be adaptive for them so it'd be nice if someone could come up with something other than hypnosis. I think Spiegel would agree. Super interested in psychedelics as medicine"}
{"question": "Can regular meditation lead to less sleep needs, and if so, what are the implications of this for people who struggle with sleep?", "doc_id": "LRM5LutB538_4", "video_id": "LRM5LutB538", "video_title": "LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman Question & Answer in Chicago, IL", "video_header": "Psychedelics in Clinical Therapy", "segment_idx": "4", "time_start": "17:17", "time_end": "30:22", "context": "to be done with somebody with experience. Worried about unlocking mental health conditions. Yeah. You should be. What does the research say, and what are your thoughts? OK. Barbed wire question, we like that. Psychedelics, well, let's just back up a little bit and acknowledge one thing that's more important than psychedelics or anything else when it comes to rewiring the brain, which is that, ultimately, rewiring of the brain is about shifts in neuromodulators, dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine. And it's no coincidence that SSRIs, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors, have been one of the major entry points for attempts to treat things like depression over the last 20-30 years or more. When I was in college, that's when the book Listening to Prozac came out. But prior to that, there's a long history of drugs, prescription drugs, in that case, to change levels of neuromodulators, like serotonin or acetylcholine or dopamine, in an attempt to cure or treat a disease. But keep in mind, despite the varied success of SSRIs, a topic unto itself, that there's a strong belief, and there has been for a long time, that, if SSRIs worked it wasn't because the depressed brain is deficient in serotonin, but rather because increasing serotonin offered the opportunity to increase neuroplasticity. So there's a different way of thinking about it, and that's a segue for saying that when you say psychedelics, that's a broad category of drugs. Nowadays, people even lump ketamine into that. Although, technically, it's not a psychedelic. But the sort of classic, if you will, psychedelics are LSD, Lysergic Acid Diethylamide, and psilocybin, aka mushrooms. Although, it comes in other sources, as well. The major effect of psilocybin is to stimulate a particular serotonin receptor which has elevated density in particular brain areas. And indeed, there are many recent clinical trials, many, let's say 12 to 20 good sized clinical trials done in diverse locations on the planet, many at Johns Hopkins and UCSF, some in Switzerland, showing that enhancing, and here you'll notice I'm using the mechanistic language, enhancing the transmission of the release of serotonin and activating particular serotonin receptors leads to an opportunity for more, what, neuroplasticity. Now, I say it that way not to add a bunch of word soup but because the real question is whether or not the experience that one has while under the influence of psychedelics is critical to the clinical outcome. Or a growing idea, just as a hypothesis, I think is equally interesting is that it's the serotonin itself and that the things you see, the things you hear, the things you experience are not relevant. Now, I have some experience with psychedelics. I had a bad time on psychedelics as a teenager. I was also pretty wayward youth. But I've had a bad trip on LSD. For years, I was scared that people were going to dose me with LSD after that. It was so bad. I think across the board, we can say, kids doing psychedelics just seems like a bad idea. Their brains are already hypoplastic. If you have a predisposition to bipolar type issues or schizophrenia, it can exacerbate those issues. And, certainly, if you don't have adequate support, in the form of somebody that can guide you through the sessions, as well as the presessions, which are not done with psychedelics, as well as the so-called integration afterwards, it can be a really slippery slope. I know examples of people really suffering in the aftermath of psychedelic journeys. Now, there are a few interesting points, as well, and it wouldn't be fair if I didn't say that several, if not many, individuals who have had so-called treatment resistant depression, at least in these clinical trials, have reported feeling far better after psilocybin therapy, but that psilocybin therapy was done with several presessions, then the psychedelic sessions then several after sessions. And it's not always the case that things turn out well. So I think it's early days. What is interesting, and I think important, is to recognize that psilocybin and the structure of psilocybin is very similar to serotonin itself, very similar, but it activates particular receptors. A lot of people don't realize how similar to serotonin it is, and that microdosing psilocybin, I should say the data on microdosing psilocybin, something that's increasingly popular, is not particularly compelling. It's not clear what it does. It's not clear if it's of any use. And I think the danger here is that we end up in a situation as we did with, frankly, with cannabis. And, by the way, I'm not somebody who demonizes cannabis. I think it has its uses for certain people, but very high THC concentration cannabis can be a problem, especially with people that have a predisposition to psychosis. And anyone that tells you that cannabis isn't addictive, just say, great, don't smoke weed for a week. Let's see how you do. Yeah. And let's go on a plane trip together. And how are you sleeping? And so I think the chronic cannabis users are starting to take note of some of the issues it causes but, again, there are some clinical applications. Now, when it comes to the high speed train psychedelics, like DMT, that's far less data available there. And then MDMA, assisted psychotherapy for the treatment of PTSD, there, the data I think are more robust, and I think we're likely to see legalization or at least decriminalization in the next few years. But keep in mind that MDMA is methylenedioxymethamphetamine. So for people that like dopaminergic states, it's a particularly compelling state to be in, so much so that they could overindulge in MDMA, and then there's the issues of purity, and I could do a five hour podcast on this right now. So I think the important point is approach with caution. Kids, absolutely not. And I think it's an exciting landscape, very exciting, and whereas a discussion like the one we just had would have gotten me fired a few years ago. I mean, Stanford has big programs now, a lot of philanthropy, federal grants, and many laboratories focused on the study of psychedelics. So I would say stay tuned. But keep in mind that increasing neuromodulator levels very acutely, whether or not it's with a prescription drug or whether or not it's with psychedelics, is really what lies at the heart of the recovery, the potential recovery, I should say, or the negative effects that happen to occur in anyone that embarks on the psychedelic journey. Do people who meditate and need less sleep than people who don't? Oh, that's interesting. Well, we know that from a study by Wendy Suzuki, who I believe, if NYU made the right choice, and I think they did is, now the Dean of Arts and Sciences at NYU. She ran a memory lab for a long time. She has data showing that even 10, I think it's 13, but as little as 10 minutes of meditation, so it'll be sitting still, breathing, focusing on your breathing, directing one's attention to third eye center, et cetera. We don't have a third eye. The pineal is thought to be the third eye. But I don't know why people say it's a light sensitive tissue deep in the brain but maybe that's why they call it the third eye. But, in any case, that type of practice has been shown to increase memory focus, aka learning, but there's some interesting footnotes in those papers, which point to the fact that when people meditate too close to bedtime, oftentimes, they have trouble sleeping because, basically, meditation is a focusing exercise. It's a perceptual exercise. I don't think of meditation is anything mystical. It's a self-directed shift in your perception to, what, to your interoception, to your internal state, as opposed to anything beyond the confines of your skin. There's nothing mystical about that. And then, in that state, your brain starts to generate patterns of activity that are distinct from when you're sharing your attention between what's going on internally and what's happening out in the world, right? I think we need to demystify what people have cloaked as mystical. And when I say cloaked, I don't think that the people that have meditated for thousands of years thought that there was anything mystical about it but, sometimes, what we experience there can feel mystical. So if you have trouble sleeping, I recommend doing some sort of non-sleep deep rest practice, like NSDR, aka yoga nidra. Although, those are different. NSDR generally lacks the intention piece. And the ones that I've put into the world, we've stripped away the intentions, and we've stripped away any kind of language that would make you think that there was some sort of, let's just say, like cultural aspect to it, which, again, is admittedly a bit unfair to the origin practice of yoga nidra. But the problem, again, is that in yoga nidra, you're going to be doing intentions and hearing language that for some people, not all, might divorce you from the wish to do it. In any case, non-sleep deep rest done at any time of day, but especially if you fall asleep in the middle of the night, is going to be useful for helping you fall back asleep. Whereas meditation, again, is going to enhance your level of focus. So I don't think it's a good practice if you have trouble sleeping. Now, to finally answer your question, if you meditate, can you afford to sleep less? My friend, Matt Walker, would say no. However, many of us can't sleep as much as we want to, and many of us are not like Matt, where we can wake up without an alarm clock. I'll just keep sleeping and sleeping, unless I went to bed at like 8:00. This is actually interesting. There's an asymmetry to your sleep needs. If you go to bed, remember that old adage, every hour before midnight is worth two after? Well, it turns out that for people that are meant to be early risers, going to bed at 8:00, you'll wake up at 3:00 or 4:00 feeling great. You go to bed at 11:00, you feel groggy, and there are good reasons to explain that. But Matt would say that need your sleep, period. I'm more of the camp, based on my read of the data, And, yes, we are allowed to disagree and still be friends. It's allowed. In fact, Matt's going to do a series on sleep with our podcast, even though he has a terrific podcast of his own, where we will maybe debate a little bit of this, that there are ways that you can at least replace the feeling of wakefulness that you would have lost if you don't sleep enough. And for me, really, that's why NSDR became such an attractive tool to do for 10 or 30 minutes each morning if I didn't sleep enough the night before. I first learned about yoga nidra, actually at addiction recovery center, trauma recovery center in Florida in 2017. I have a friend, a super talented trauma therapist, who also treats addiction, that I've sent many, many people to, and he has this kind of seemingly like wizard ability to get people who have been addicts to not be addicts. And one of the tools he uses is yoga nidra every morning for 30 minutes, and eventually an hour, which seems like a lot, but then he also has these people wake up very early, maybe an hour before they would normally wake up, and go into that liminal state between sleep and wakefulness. Now, my experience is that 10 to 20 minutes of NSDR, yoga nidra, is sufficient to offset some sleep loss and allow at least me to function, and many people report the same. We have a study going with the Sleep Laboratory at Stanford to explore this in more depth. And what I can tell you, because I'm involved in some of this work, is that there are several military units, because they have no opportunity to get sleep because they're working, that have to rely on tools like this in order to be able to function at their highest level. And I'm sure they will tell you, as I will, that they'd prefer to get 8 to 10 hours of sleep. But, guess what, they can't, and so I think that's the important takeaway is that we don't get to pick how much we sleep, unless you're going to be completely neurotic about your sleep hygiene, which makes you kind of a less interesting person in life, is what I'm told. Going to bed at 8:00 is great like some or most of the time but you got to stay up every once in a while. I mean, after they released \"Chimp Empire\" on Netflix, I discovered that NSDR is a very valuable tool. And by the way, \"Chimp Empire\" and \"Succession\" have a lot of parallels. And if you watch one, I interleave \"Chimp Empire\", \"Succession\", \"Chimp Empire\", \"Succession\". And you start to realize, like, whoa, like were pretty similar. And then you look at the world differently, I promise. Your podcast has positively changed the lives of so many people, including me, how has it changed your life?"}

I wasn't expecting that one. Thank you, Samantha. Well, first of all, I mean, as this little 11-year-old told me. I mean, this is essentially what I've done my whole life. I'm a fairly private person. Believe it or not, I'm pretty introverted. I spend a lot of time alone, and I think that's required for me. I basically have four modes. Four modes. One, I'm either readying myself through sleep and NSDR to do one of the other three modes, maybe there's a fifth mode, or I'm in one of these other three modes, which is I'm either foraging for information, organizing that information, or dispersing that information, or getting ready to do it all over again. And then, there's this relaxation vacation thing that they keep telling me about. But then I went to Italy, and then like Rick and I like just hung out there, and it didn't feel like work. I also discovered some really great podcasts. I don't know, I think one of the coolest podcasts out there if you like rock and roll, which I love, is A History of 500 Songs by Andrew Hickey's podcast on rock and roll. I like the nerdy podcasts. It's like a graduate or an education in rock and roll. It's so cool. And you'll learn a lot about music and history and the mobs involved and all that stuff. And from what I was told, like Al Capone used to sit there, right? His exit was there, you know, so it was weird. Right? And then he died of syphilis, and like so I don't know how I feel about all that, but they told me that. So I think the podcast has been wonderful as an opportunity to share things that I love. If I had my way, it would be more like this, although more of a dialogue, frankly. It's changed my understanding of what the world is like. I certainly get critique, and that's good. But, again, I was raised by iconoclasts, and particularly my postdoc advisor, Ben Barrus, who unfortunately, as I mentioned, is dead because I worked for him. But he really encouraged all of us in his lab. And often, we were very close friends. I spent the last year of his life recording interview with him. There's actually a documentary coming out about Ben, and then I'm going to release the audio interviews with Ben, which he approved, by the way. And you'll get to realize that the history of what you see is often not what the dead person really did or said. It's going to be fun, so I can't wait till they release this documentary, and then Ben gets to have his voice infused in it. And it'll be a cool documentary. But, as some of you know, that what appears to be and what was and the historical narrative is not necessarily what really happened, but that's just life. So I suppose the short answer is that I feel very honored with the opportunity. Very, very honored. And it's a challenge at times. I suppose the major challenges are when things are taken out of context, like little clips, and things of that sort. Being misunderstood doesn't feel good. But look, at the end of the day, I feel like the luckiest person in the world because I get to spend my time learning. So it's either I'm foraging, I'm organizing or I'm dispersing information that I also want and that I find incredibly useful. Or if not that, then certainly informative and, at times, enchanting as well. So I try and focus on the positive, and I have a number of practices that help me do that. And I am somebody who engages on social media. I'm not a post and ghost kind of person. I want to understand. I think that cuttlefish are super interesting, but human beings are super interesting too. And I have a strong drive for mastery, but also I do have a strong sense of justice, and that can be problematic at times. I define justice as feeling like there's something for us to do about something. Like seeing something that upsets us or that excites us is great, but then if you have a strong sense of justice, you feel like there's something you need to do about it, and not everybody feels that. And then, of course, a desire to understand. And I think, for reasons very personal to me, that relate mostly to just having a kind of incredible array of experiences in life, many of which were like shocking, disturbing, exciting, enchanting that I want to understand. And so it's changed things, but it's like, I don't know, I got one truck, one watch. Which is not to say that I don't care about having things. There are a few things I really love, but mostly, like I'm just thinking about the podcast we got to record on Monday which is about willpower and tenacity. And if I don't stop myself, I'll give it right now. So what do you feel is the next big thing"}
{"question": "Does the time change from daylight savings affect our circadian rhythms and overall well-being?", "doc_id": "LRM5LutB538_6", "video_id": "LRM5LutB538", "video_title": "LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman Question & Answer in Chicago, IL", "video_header": "What Do You Feel Is the Next Big Thing in the Health Space?", "segment_idx": "6", "time_start": "35:23", "time_end": "44:27", "context": "to come to the forefront in the health space? Thanks for this question. One is non-protein amino acids. I love these debates online because I know that there's something there. It's so cool because I grew up in seeing these debates, and you know there's something interesting there because people are debating about it. But the debate isn't what's interesting. It's almost always the thing that people aren't talking about that's sure to surface at some point. And right now, there's. This obsession with like seed oils it's like seed oil. Seed oils. And I can't demonize seed oils. All the data say that if you separate out their caloric load, there's nothing inherently bad about seed oils, and et cetera. I don't know. It's still an emerging literature. But there was a scientist at Stanford, Ed Rubenstein, who passed away at a ripe old age, a brilliant scientist, who talked about, and I had a lot of discussions with when I was a postdoc, about non-protein amino acids. It turns out his son is a neuroscientist at UCSF. His other son is a physician at UCSF. So it's another one of these low performing families. And all wonderful people. And you know, Ed had data that unlike a lot of animals, like birds, there are certain amino acids, which are non-protein amino acids, that exist in fairly high density in seeds and nuts, which is not to say that seeds and nuts are bad. I had almonds this evening, so please. But non-protein amino acids are similar enough to mammalian protein amino acids that if they are consumed in abundance, and perhaps especially in liquid form, that they may, again, may, because this is about the future. This isn't about what we know. This is about where I think there's interest and growing interest. They may be able to incorporate into certain proteins of our tissues of our body that potentially Ed thought could lead to misfolding of those proteins and may explain certain forms of neurodegeneration and other neurocognitive challenges. So I think non-protein amino acids are going to be an important discussion. Now, there are lots of non protein amino acids that don't come from foods, but I think the discussion around non protein amino acids from foods is going to be very interesting. So that's one area. The other area, and perhaps you picked up on this a little bit tonight, is that I like the nuts and boltsy stuff around stress, neuroplasticity. But the high level stuff, I think the relationship between structured thought, abstract thought, I'm not interested in the free will discussion. I just feel like that's a career ender. I'm friends with Robert Sapolsky, and he's got a great book coming out about this called \"Determined\", so he obviously doesn't believe in free will. But he's far smarter than I ever could be. And it just feels like, I don't know that there's an endpoint with that one. But if anyone could find, it would be Robert. He's oh so smart. But I think that the higher level stuff, creativity, abstract reasoning and thought, defining and better understanding the different states that we can go into in waking. And I confess, without a hint of sheepishness about it, that I also think the notion of spirituality and the belief in things that are beyond our current and conscious understanding is super interesting. I think that as a species we've been challenged and conflicted from go, at least that's what the historical scripture tells us, and that it's sort of inherent to our experience that life is challenging and perplexing and also wonderful. And so I think a better understanding of how to navigate all that, I mean, this stuff in our skulls, except for the eyes, which, by the way, are your two pieces of brain that are not in your skull, the retinas. I have to point that out. You know, it's tricky, and we're trying to use that very tissue to understand it. And so I'm intrigued by the possibility that there are certain aspects of self that maybe are not intended to be explored because they are not really of us, right? Brains interacting with one another is an interesting area, certainly for scientific exploration, but I'm fascinated by and excited about the possibility that, at some point, our species will both understand and the mechanics of our emotions, mechanics of our thought process, creativity, and so on, but that we will also allow room for the stuff that we can't explain with science and to allow room for that in our life experience because I also believe that can be powerful. And while understanding things in great detail and putting mechanism and utility around that and applying that is wonderful, it's the stuff of my life, which is obvious, I also think that there's great value in not trying to control and understand everything and enjoying the mystery of things that are clearly greater than us. [APPLAUSE] How do you balance having fun with having such a rich knowledge and passion in neuroscience and optimization? Fun. People ask me, like what do you do for fun? I think people think I do all the protocols. It's like, sure, I get my sunlight, I drink my water. I do. I do them. But fun, I like learning. I like learning. I do enjoy physical movement. I like learning. For me, OK, so like for me, it's the little things. I don't know, maybe I'm weird. Certainly, I've been told that. The other day, there was a frog in my swimming pool, and he was just like sitting there like. And I just like spent some time looking at him back and forth, and then I had all sorts of ideas about what's he doing? And what's he thinking? And then I was thinking how Oliver Sacks used to spend time imagining experiencing life as a bat through only echolocation. He talked about this. And I thought, and why would he do that? Right? And that's kind of cute. He's like delightful old man, right? He had a 600 pounds free weight squat, won the state California squatting championship but also liked pretending he was a bat. He's a weird dude. Did methamphetamines, raced motorcycles, hung out with movie stars, but then also was like a recluse and liked rocks. OK, that's a weird scientist. Been around a lot of those. But in discussions with people that knew him, I mean, that exercise of like seeing something he thought was cool like a bat allowed him to also use theory of mind to kind of think, what would it be like to have locked in syndrome and only be able to blink your eyes to communicate? And gave him an incredible compassion and sensitivity for other people that then he transmuted into the form of these wonderful books. So for me, fun is really about doing the things that I do systematically each day, but then when something excites me. I know that feeling. I know it physically in my body. And to just follow that trail like a weirdo, right? Like a weirdo, just like Barrus was weird and Barbara Chapman was weird. And like, I think everybody's a little weird if you allow yourself to just see the things that you think are really cool. And there are a bunch of things that I think are really cool that enchant me that a bunch of other people love too. And I know that because I see we're all watching that video or something like that. But I think for me, fun is in the practice of trying to stay open to like the little things. The little things that kids say are always delightful because they're not filtering through all the bullshit that we filter our life experience through. But also just, yeah, I like reading and learning, exercising. I mean, I like to think I'm not a very wooden person. But, at the same time, I mean, I didn't see the \"Barbie\" movie. No disrespect to Barbie. I go to movies. I do that kind of thing. I don't know what else is there to do? At some point, you know, what else is there to do? Anyway, I mean, I delight in certain things, as you now know far too much about. But fun is a relative term. That was a hard question. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING & APPLAUDING] Thank you. Thanks for the pass.

Daylight saving time is anti-health. OK, this is where I'll get like, it's just dumb. It's just dumb. It's just so dumb. It makes no sense. I mean, the director of the Chronobiology Unit at the National Institutes of Mental Health, my good friend, long time friend and brilliant scientist, Samer Hattar, will tell you, it's a stupid idea. It's anti-biology. And increased car crashes, increase heart attacks, increased depression. Kids don't like to wake up early anyway. Parents don't like to wake up early, especially with kids that don't like wake up early. It makes no sense. And then there are all these arguments about is really about trying to truncate the late, you want more light in the evening so there's less crime. Like, that's totally unsubstantiated. Like, completely unsubstantiated. So the daylight savings thing is just stupid. Basically, try and get as much light in your eyes, ideally from sunlight early in the day. And, by the way, if you're worried about cataract, that's a serious concern. After all, I have an appointment in ophthalmology. Cataract, macular degeneration. But guess what, the chair of ophthalmology from Stanford when he came on the podcast verified this. When the sun is low in the sky, you're not really at risk of that. So when the sun is overhead and you're like beaming in your eyes, like trying to get, yeah, it's a problem, but we're talking about viewing low solar angle sunlight in the morning and in the evening. And if there's clouds, do it anyway. In fact, do it longer. And if you can't do that, look at some artificial light inside. Daylight savings, it's just stupid. You know, what happens here is as the night goes on, the amount of GABA in my brain starts to diminish, and I just kind of go to short form. We've thought about podcasting in the middle of the night. That's why when I went on Lex's podcast recently, the more recent one, he did it at 8:00 o'clock at night, and he cried. He made me cry. He didn't cry. He made me cry. I was so tired, and I can't think, and then he asked me about my dog, and I'm talking about the dog. So his goal was to get me to cry. We have this friendship, you know. No, he's delightful. What should I as a 19-year-old college student be doing to maximize the years of neuroplasticity I have left?"}
{"question": "What are some effective ways for a 19-year-old college student to optimize their brain development and set themselves up for long-term success and happiness?", "doc_id": "LRM5LutB538_8", "video_id": "LRM5LutB538", "video_title": "LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman Question & Answer in Chicago, IL", "video_header": "Enhancing Neuroplasticity: Strategies for a 19-Year-Old College Student", "segment_idx": "8", "time_start": "46:39", "time_end": "50:13", "context": "I get this question, I'm like, oh, man. It's such a great question. Rhys, I'm assuming, yeah. I don't know who you are, Rhys, or what you're doing, but you're 19. So the cool thing is, your brain is hypoplastic. Life is a psychedelic experience without psychedelics. Gosh, people always say, like, if you could go back to your 19-year-old self, what would you do? And that's a tricky one. There are movies about that, right? You know, I would definitely worry less. Yeah. I would worry less. I would have more fun. I would certainly, listen, I started latching on to practices and the understanding of science as a way, for me it was kind of like my world felt very unstable. And for me, it brought stability. But you want to avoid rigidity. So do you want to be the one 19-year-old who's like, oh, got to get to sleep. You know, I got to go back to bed at 8:30 at night. Enjoy life. But I would say, when you're 19, learn how you learn. Learn how to focus. Learn how to rest. Basically, you can stress and focus as much as you want as long as you can still fall asleep at night and sleep well and fall back asleep if you wake up. We hear stress is bad, stress is good, stress is bad, stress is good. Stress is bad unless you're getting enough sleep, in which case, stress is called learning in life. Now, obviously, don't do anything dangerous. Avoid psychological and physical danger. But I think as a 19-year-old, I mean my direct advice would have some cardiovascular activity you like, have some resistance training activity you like, develop some sort of self awareness practice like journaling. It could be meditation. Surround yourself with people that you like. Avoid people you don't like. I mean, it sounds so straightforward but then we can all look into our personal histories and be like, wow, I spent all this time trying to resolve this thing that, clearly, you didn't like them. It's simple. You didn't like them. They weren't into cuttlefish or ferrets. You didn't like them. Wasn't your kind of person, right? And that's not a box you can check on the dating apps, they tell me, right? The ferret thing, I think it'd be very, very, very small subset of people. I think the know thyself thing is huge. Learn to tap into that early feeling of like this feels right. This doesn't feel right. Learn to be a bit of a rudder for yourself. And journal. I still have stacks of things that I wrote across the years, most of it is terrible, but you will find if you go back that you kind of knew better all along even if you didn't do better all along. That voice in your head, don't do that. Do that. This person's like everyone else is crazy about this person but not me. I don't want to sound sentimental, but you have to find your heart, right, or at least not lose it. You have to make sure that you're in touch with that piece of yourself that wasn't judging and just felt good. And as long as it's not something that's self-destructive, I think that's the most important thing. And then, yeah, have tools and practices in place, because they work, and when you're 19, and your neural neuroplasticity is through the roof, you can do a lot less and get a lot more. But don't worry about hitting 25 and it all being over. Certainly, that's not the case. But you can cram in a lot early on. I still regret not learning an instrument. The data on people that learn an instrument even later in life, but certainly at 19, is that it greatly increases your ability to learn all sorts of things. So learn an instrument. How can we transform the American education system"}
{"question": "What role should education play in teaching children about their brain, body, and how to manage stress, anxiety, and other mental health issues?", "doc_id": "LRM5LutB538_9", "video_id": "LRM5LutB538", "video_title": "LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman Question & Answer in Chicago, IL", "video_header": "How Can We Transform the American Education System to Be More Effective?", "segment_idx": "9", "time_start": "50:19", "time_end": "54:03", "context": "to be more effective? Oh, so in ten seconds. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] So when I'm in charge. Nah, I'm just kidding. A little while back, I did an interview with a major media outlet, and they were very gracious. And then they said, like, what's next? And I was like, I'm going to run for office. I was just like, look, it's not out of the question. But frankly, I think that I'm so poorly suited for that, it's obvious. I'm so poorly suited for that. So it wasn't a joke, but I think as I spent some time afterwards like, I should really go talk to people who do that for a living. But I am very interested in potentially informing policy. If I were to ever be asked, I'd certainly respond. And my stance on this is much in the same vein as the podcast, because keep in mind, the podcast, yes, like suggested I start one, but it was really during those days of the deep 2020 and 2021 pandemic where, by the way, I wasn't allowed to talk about vaccines so I didn't. And also, I don't have any expertise in it, so I was not well suited to do it. But I also decided it's a topic that enough people are talking about. So my response in life, and in general, when people say, what about something is I like, well, I've got a lot of opinions about that, but this isn't the venue. OK. But during the pandemic, I realized there was a lot of circadian disruption, anxiety, stress, a bunch of things happening with visual systems and biological systems that I felt there were tools that people could, perhaps, benefit from. So I started putting that information into the world, and I was really surprised, really surprised that people that I knew from the neuroscience community, for instance at NIMH or in government positions, weren't talking about this stuff, so I just kept doing it. And I think that it made clear to me that the education system is not one thing. It's tough, especially when talking about kids like what to do is a tricky thing. But that the education system, in my mind, should at least involve some sort of discussion early on about this thing called the brain, this thing called the body, how they work, how you can do certain things to modulate your stress level, your sleep not just the importance of sleep and nutrition and avoiding social isolation and all these important things, but giving people some levers and knobs to maneuver within themselves and zero cost tools as a way to do that that transcend socioeconomic boundaries, ideally transcend language as well, because we're not just talking about the United States. And of course, within the United States, there are many different cultures speaking different languages. And maybe AI will soon allow us to put out the podcast into a bunch of different languages. I think it will. So I think the education system should start, in my opinion, with teaching kids how to understand themselves, what to do in difficult scenarios that's really anchored in the real pillars of biology and psychology, and take some of the mystery out of trying to navigate the tough business of growing up. I mean, if you think it's tough being an adult, which it can be, certainly. It's really tough growing up, as we all know. And I think that more tools, more tools, more protocols more tools, more tools, more protocols, more tools. But that's obviously a biased opinion. And no one's ever asked me like, hey, what should we be teaching kids? But if they ask, as you can tell, like, I'm not going to shut up. So I think that was our last question.

He's a Stanford and Harvard trained psychiatrist, and I wanted to do the series with Paul for several reasons, and we initiated that series. First of all, he's incredibly talented as a clinician. And yet despite having written an excellent book about trauma, I felt that two things were true for sure. One is that most people won't get the opportunity to work with Paul, sadly. He's time limited. And second is that his expertise is incredibly vast not just restricted to trauma. Traumas, if understood, can be transmuted into deep sources of knowledge that other people can benefit from. Indeed, what I found in Paul as I got to know him is that he has just profound insight into the unconscious mind. And people had long asked me in and around the podcast, what about the subconscious? What about the unconscious? And I was of the mind that the supercomputer of the human brain is the forebrain, the thinking, planning, context, setting piece right behind our forehead. It's the reason that we're not the house cats. The house cats are the house cats, and it's the reason we're the curators of the planet. But Paul said, oh, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no. The unconscious mind is the supercomputer of the mind. I'm like, well, that sounds great. But how do we understand the unconscious mind? And he has a really biological and psychological and psychiatric understanding of the unconscious. And in that series, he talks about these so-called cupboards that we can look into in order to better understand our unconscious mind in order to allow our unconscious mind to teach us things about ourselves that are useful. And there are three main places where our unconscious teaches us useful things that allow us to be more conscious of the way that our brain is working in useful ways. The first is in these liminal states between waking and sleep. It really does seem to be the case that when, surprise, surprise, we're completely still and we're emerging from or we're dropping into states of reduced autonomic arousal but our level of thought, if you will, is still active enough that we are aware maybe even lucid dreams and also in dreams, our unconscious mind uses, as I think Jung and Freud pretty well understood, symbols to teach us things. But everything's flipped in there. Gender's flipped. Just because you're having a conflict with somebody in your life who's a man doesn't mean that person shows up as a man. They could show up as an animal, so species are flipped. The symbols become mishmashed, but Paul made it very clear that all this can be parsed if you do a certain kind of introspective work. And I thought that would mean a lot of talk therapy. How are we going to get people to learn how to do talk therapy by themselves? We want to keep things as much independent of cost and things like that. And the practices he started talking about were incredibly simple. Things like mirror work-- some of the psychologists in the room will be familiar with this. I thought, mirror work? What is that? And he said, literally, people trying to access their unconscious in sleep by a practice of staring into the mirror for some period of time while awake and reflecting on self and aspirations and the idea of the body as a container. All this stuff, even for a kid from Northern California, sounds really, woo, new agey. But here, it's scripted by Paul into a formal structure that one can use to parse your own mental health and enhance mental health. So that was the reason for doing the series. And especially the episode on relationships, not just romantic relationships, I found-- hasn't come out yet. Incredibly interesting, because he talked about how in his clinical experience, virtually all the stuff that people pay attention to in relational stuff is, are they a narcissist? Are they obsessive? Is this person a musician versus whether or not I'm an accountant? Are we compatible? That none of that stuff predicts anything as well as the balance of these three drives-- the aggressive drive, the pleasure drive, and the so-called generative drive. And I found it to be fascinating, and I'm excited for that episode and the other episodes to come out. But basically, because Paul is brilliant. And he makes what I consider pretty obscure and opaque very clear and concrete, and there are a bunch of worksheets-- again, all available at zero cost and none of them requiring that you do therapy with anybody if you choose not to. This is all the kind of work that one could do on oneself. And the last thing I'll say about this is-- and I should have said this first-- is that the primary motivation was we did a series of Dr. Andy Galpin on physical fitness. Why isn't there a series on mental fitness? What is that? Why do we talk so much about mental health when we're-- and it's usually a conversation about mental illness. People should have tools and practices that are zero cost, I believe, to be able to introspect in a structured way and enhance their mental health independent of their level of income, and I think Paul was the guy to do it. And we'll do more of that with other people as well because no single episode about any topic or series can exhaustively cover any topic, although Lord knows we will try. OK. Next question. What are the recommended protocols and best practices"}
{"question": "What are some practical strategies for developing emotional resilience and responding effectively in triggering situations, and how can morning routines and practices help in achieving this?", "doc_id": "eC9fiJBdMG0_2", "video_id": "eC9fiJBdMG0", "video_title": "LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman Question & Answer in Toronto, ON", "video_header": "Enhancing Emotional Resilience in Triggering Situations: Protocols and Best Practices", "segment_idx": "2", "time_start": "8:09", "time_end": "12:43", "context": "to enhance emotional resilience and develop effective responses during highly triggering situation? You're asking the wrong guy. I mean, I don't snap. I don't snap. I was a wild teenager, but I don't snap. I'm not the aggressor, but I do have a snap button, and it's been pushed before. And I have to say when that happens, it's really kind of a scary thing. Not to me, right? And it's been many years. But I think anyone who's hit that threshold where you're trying not to say something, you say it anyway. That's usually how it shows up for people. I think we hear the statements. Be responsive, not reactive. That's why I became a biologist because stuff like that makes no sense to me. In that moment, how are you responsive, not reactive? So to me, it was like, what are the tools? Clearly, as you go up that continuum of autonomic arousal, it becomes much harder to do whatever that means, right? Hence, the tools for reducing stress in real time. I think the one that we haven't emphasized so much on the podcast-- and by the way, thanks to some great therapy that was not voluntary, I was able to-- I was a wild kid. I was a wild, wild kid. I hung around wild kids, and things were pretty different then, and we worked it out. But I think nowadays, it's wonderful because I think people are more conscious of the need to understand their nervous system, their own psychology. That wasn't as common back then. In fact, I hid the fact that I had to do therapy for a long time, thinking, wow. Everyone's going to think I'm crazy. They did call me crazy. I think things have really changed. I think the last 20 years have brought about a profound shift in the way that we think about our own species and what our useful tools and practices. And I think that one of the things that is abundantly clear is that threshold for a stress response really is different for different people, different in different situations, but that it is something that can be practiced and elevated in terms of not getting near that trigger point through the types of practices that I talked about earlier. Getting more comfortable with adrenaline circulating in your system is what it's really about, frankly. But of course, it all starts with a good night's sleep, right? It's going to make you far less reactive. But of course, when you're stressed, that's often when you're not getting good sleep. So I think ultimately that our ability to-- as more emotional resilience and effective responses during triggering situations is really the consequence of practices of taking good care outside of those situations. And then of course, inevitably, there will be situations where people get triggered. And it's actually interesting to see the way that people behave online and the fact that many people, in fact, in science as well have literally lost their jobs for not being able to control their thumbs. We're in an odd time where there's the distancing of doing things online as opposed to in person where people somehow engage in saying things and doing things that they wouldn't in person. But I think that ultimately it's the consequence of good self care, and this gets actually back to some of the things that are covered in the Conti series. We hear about self care. We think that means massages, which are great, by the way. And we think that is about exercise, and that's wonderful. But much of self care is about really making sure that our nervous system is in the state that we need it to be in order to go about our day. And I think this is why morning routines and practices are so vital. I think that those set the stage for the emotional resilience. Those set the stage for avoiding getting triggered, so to speak. I don't think there's a lot that one can do in real time except perhaps physiological sighs. So sorry to give you a sort of empty answer. I'm not a pessimist on this front. But I think that ultimately, it's like saying, well, what if you have to scale the side of a building to get in and you locked yourself out? What can you do to prepare for that? Well, you can buy a ladder. But if you don't have a ladder, what you probably should do is be physically fit enough to climb up a railing or something like that and know how to pick a lock or something like that. So I think ultimately that it's the consequence of stuff that's done away from those triggering situations. Next question, please.

I think one of the things that I've observed over and over again is that as much as we need to dedicate ourselves to our craft, to our families, to our friends, that ultimately our best ideas come from disparate experiences when we're not seeking a particular kind of input to get ideas. Now, maybe, this practice of being completely still while being alert fosters a lot of-- I think the way I understand it is more of a geysering up of stored information in the unconscious. That's how I think Rick would talk about it or Paul Conti would talk about it, as geysering up from the unconscious. Because when we are focused on the outside world, we're taking in sensory information, exteroception as opposed to interoception. Of course, that external sensory information-- that no input, no output-- is that those are the raw materials that our nervous system uses to construct ideas about anything. So my belief-- and this is a practice I do every week is I make sure that at least once a week I either walk or hike or run without any earphones. And I'm trying to get into states of wordlessness, states where I'm not digesting a podcast, where I'm not reading a book, where I'm not listening to a lecture, where I'm not in conversation, and essentially, trying to turn off the linguistic narrative. We are a storytelling species. We tend to take all of our internal and external experience and construct things around language. But spoken language is not the language of the nervous system. The language of the nervous system still remains to be identified. It's something else. For people that think in feels, it will certainly incorporate that. Spoken language, of course, is important, and we have some core structures to spoken language. We covered this in the podcast episode with my friend Eddie Chang. But ultimately the way to come up with new ideas or inspiration is going to be to collect the raw materials of experience and then give ourselves these periods, maybe even just five, 10 minutes-- you don't have to lay around half the day doing nothing still wide awake-- and give that those raw materials the opportunity to marinate and combine in whatever ways that are unique to you and then to geyser up. What inspiration looks like in the brain, we don't really know. There's awe. There are some studies about awe, but that's different. The word that better comes to mind is delight. Awe in my mind is something that we witness that sort of overwhelms our attention. Like, wow. Delight is when it somehow links up with our own internal narrative. Like, I have something to do with what's happening. I'm not just here to witness it. A really impressive fireworks show is like awe, but there's nothing to do about it. It doesn't relate to anything about you, really. You're purely a spectator. Whereas delight is when you see something and it somehow links to something in your emotional or personal history or how you're wired, that now there's something to do about it. That's inspiration. And we don't understand where that exists in the brain or what that looks like, but I think we all recognize that feeling when it happens, and it's oh so wonderful. OK. Next question, please. How can Canadians fight the seasonal depression? Winters are too long here."}
{"question": "How can I increase my exposure to bright morning light naturally, without relying on artificial light therapy lamps or devices, to help offset seasonal depression?", "doc_id": "eC9fiJBdMG0_4", "video_id": "eC9fiJBdMG0", "video_title": "LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman Question & Answer in Toronto, ON", "video_header": "How Can Canadians Fight the Season Depression?", "segment_idx": "4", "time_start": "16:41", "time_end": "22:44", "context": "OK. Well, this gives me an opportunity to share with you what I think is one of the coolest things about our species. Notice I say that about many things. So we've talked about circadian rhythms, right? Sunrises, sunsets. And we get that information transmitted into our nervous system by looking at the sunrise. By the way, you don't have to watch the sun cross the horizon. It just needs to be low solar angle, low in the sky. Once it's overhead, it's a different signal. So low solar angle, that's what it's about. It's not necessarily about seeing the sun cross the horizon. By the way, someone the other day on my team said, won't you get cataracts if you look at the sun? Low solar angle sunlight is very unlikely to cause cataracts, especially if you're just doing it 10 to 30 minutes. The sun overhead is when it's quite bright. Yes, indeed, some people are going to be at risk for cataracts. So ophthalmologists in the audience can attack me for that one. But it was our chair of ophthalmology at Stanford that said it, so I'm going to trust him. OK. That's circadian, 24 hour rhythms. But there's also these circannual rhythms. So if you're at a fairly northern location on the planet, nights get very long. Days get short in winter. What happens then? Well, melatonin, the hormone of darkness, is essentially obliterated by sunlight. So what's happening when days are 12 hours long, you have very little melatonin, the duration of the melatonin signal is very short? Then as you proceed into the fall, days are getting shorter. Nights are getting longer. The duration of the melatonin signal is getting longer and longer. Then, of course, in winter, there's a lot more darkness. Melatonin signals are very long. Daylight signals are very short because the days are short. So you can say, OK. Well, that's obvious, thank goodness. But what that means is incredible. What that means is that you have a hormone, melatonin, that's secreted from your pineal gland, which Descartes called the seat of the soul because there's only one of them in the brain. I don't know how he up with that one. But the pineal secretes melatonin, and you suppress melatonin secretion with sunlight viewing. There's a couple of synapses in between the eye and the pineal, but it gets there up through the neck, basically, the cervical ganglia. What's wild, therefore, is that the location of the Earth around the sun and the tilt of the Earth is translated into a neural and then a hormonal signal in your brain, which to me is amazing. That literally means that the position of the Earth around the sun and its tilt are translated into a physiological signal that's working unconsciously to tell your brain and body what time of year it is. But it doesn't care what time of year it is. It cares about where you are in this orbit about the sun. So if you think about when days are, say, eight hours long in the fall versus eight hours long in the spring, what's different? What's different is how long the signal was the day before. So the seasonal depression we now know is the consequence of the melatonin signal getting longer, not an absolute duration of the melatonin signal. In other words, in the spring when a day is eight hours long, but yesterday, the day was seven hours and 48 minutes long, your brain has a memory of how much melatonin was released the day before, much more than that particular day. So it's a slow integrating clock. So this is a very roundabout way for me to teach you about the melatonin seasonal rhythm cycle and answer the question directly by saying, if you want to offset seasonal depression, what you want to do is extend the amount of bright light that you're getting in the morning slightly as days get shorter. But it's the extension of the bright light exposure-- and if you can't do that with sunlight because there's no sunlight because you live in Toronto, not Toronto, what you want to do is find some artificial source that you can look at in the morning before you leave your home. And I haven't talked much about this on the podcast because our listeners are extended it around the globe and not just in northern locations. But what this essentially means is getting maybe two to three minutes of bright light exposure as you're heading from fall into winter-- bright light from an artificial source. You do not need to purchase a so-called SAD lamp, one of these very expensive seasonal depression lamps. What I did was I purchased-- because I'm very sensitive to seasonal changes in light even though I don't live very far north. You can get a 900 lux drawing tablet. These are quite inexpensive. They're not zero cost, but quite inexpensive. And just put that on your desk or on wherever you make your coffee in the morning 90 minutes after you wake up-- this sort of thing. And just get five or so minutes before you leave the house. And then as you extend into the winter, you don't have to be neurotic about increasing the duration every day. Actually, the way these slow integrating clocks work, you could actually even just hold it a little bit closer each day. Don't burn your eyeballs out-- a little bit closer each day. But essentially, if you just dose yourself with a little bit more bright light early in the day as you extend into winter, that will essentially trick the melatonin system into thinking that you're going from eight hours into 10 hours of light as opposed to eight hours into six hours of light. OK? Very simple. And if you can't get one of these 900 lux tablets or something off a website, then you could do this with any bright incandescent bulb should work. Again, just be careful not to put it directly against your eyeball. OK. Next question, please. How do you increase neuroplasticity? Well, this is an opportunity to talk about something I should have said earlier, which is that ultimately,"}
{"question": "How can non-pharmacological methods, such as playing a musical instrument, be used to increase neuroplasticity and potentially treat mental health conditions like depression and anxiety?", "doc_id": "eC9fiJBdMG0_5", "video_id": "eC9fiJBdMG0", "video_title": "LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman Question & Answer in Toronto, ON", "video_header": "How Do You Increase Neuroplasticity After 30?", "segment_idx": "5", "time_start": "22:50", "time_end": "28:41", "context": "whether or not you are triggering neuroplasticity through elevated focus or whether or not you're taking high dose psilocybin-- your business, not mine. And we can talk about psychedelics if you want-- just decriminalized in California or soon to be decriminalized. Cool. People are enthusiastic. Yeah. I've been pretty vocal about my belief that the data are really interesting, to say the least, about not microdosing. By the way, there's not a lot of evidence that microdosing is useful. I'm not saying it's not, but there not a lot of clinical trials showing that. But the two macro dose with effective therapeutic support trials are very encouraging not just for major depression but also for various eating disorders, alcohol use disorder, which is, by the way, the term that people are starting to shift to as opposed to alcoholism-- alcohol use disorder. Which is not to be politically correct, just so you understand what they're talking about when they're talking about alcohol use disorder. Whether or not psilocybin, whether or not it's MDMA, whether or not it's frustration brought about by your inability to play an instrument and your determination to do so, in the end, it's all about deployment of these neuromodulators, neuromodulators being some combination of dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, or epinephrine, again, usually in combination. What's very clear is that the neuroplastic effects of MDMA, the neuroplastic effects of psilocybin are brought about by huge increases in serotonin. This also can help us understand why, for some years, and to some extent still now, it was thought that the SSRIs, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, would be good treatments for depression. I think some people, by the way, have experienced tremendous relief from the SSRIs. We don't want to demonize them. At the same time, it's very clear that depression is not simply low levels of serotonin. That's also not true, hence why there's effective, in some people, antidepressants like bupropion that increase dopamine and epinephrine and not serotonin. The point here is that these neuromodulators, as they're called, allow for what? They allow for modulation of synapses, which effectively allows for neuroplasticity. I mean, ultimately whether or not it's through talk therapy, Kundalini breathing, high dose psilocybin, MDMA, or the combination, which I think is called a hippy flip-- [LAUGHTER] Never done them together. I confess. Never done them together, but have done them with a clinician, by the way, in legal circumstances. And not a lot-- not often, that is. It's very clear that it's opening windows for plasticity. Now, what's intriguing, if we're going to just talk about psychedelics for a second, is why a drug like MDMA, which increases dopamine-- which, by the way, MDMA is methylenedioxymethamphetamine. Don't let anybody tell you it's something different. It's meth. It's meth. But it's meth with a lot of serotonin thrown in there, too. But it's meth. And it's clear that for the treatment of PTSD, it holds promise. It's not absolutely safe, especially for people with cardiac conditions. If you're going to go down that path, you want and need a skilled guide, and this is where I think the laws are really going to have to pay careful attention to who and what is a skilled guide, OK? And when it comes to psilocybin, the serotonin increase is what effectively causes broader connectivity in the brain. And what's interesting is that both of those drugs increase plasticity mainly through increases in serotonin but working on very different receptors. So they have different types and outputs of plasticity. What's interesting to me is that-- because I'm a strong believer that children should not be doing psychedelics nor should we be giving children psychedelics-- is that the increases in connectivity in the brain that are the consequence of playing a musical instrument, or ideally, an instrument with others as a child, mimic a lot of the broader scale connectivity, sort of so-called resting network connectivity, that occurs when people take psychedelics as adults. In other words-- and I can't emphasize this enough. And again, I failed at music miserably. I'll tell you a story about that in a second. Getting kids to play an instrument-- it's very clear it improves their ability to learn all sorts of things for their entire life. It's just so, so important. I don't really know what to do about this or who to shout at or talk to about keeping the arts active in schools and physical education. But the idea that we would just train kids in math is just frightening because if you want them to be truly good at math and science, you'd also have them play instruments. By the way, when I was a kid, I played the violin. My parents made me. It was not the instrument. I wanted to play, and we have only one picture. They taught me the Suzuki method. You're supposed to learn by ear. And there's one picture, and all the other kids have their bows up. And my bow is down, and I'm standing here on the stage, and my fly is down. And literally, the neighbor's dog howled, and I quit after that concert. So I was traumatized by it. They showed me the picture. My sister teased me relentlessly. So neuroplasticity-- figure out your choice way to increase a neuromodulator like serotonin or epinephrine, acetylcholine, or dopamine. I honestly would not encourage pharmacologic or psychedelic approaches as your primary entry point. I really don't. I think that there's a place for that in certain circumstances, but that would not be the primary entry point. Next question, please."}
{"question": "What are some simple exercises that can be done while working from home at a desk to stay active and healthy?", "doc_id": "eC9fiJBdMG0_6", "video_id": "eC9fiJBdMG0", "video_title": "LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman Question & Answer in Toronto, ON", "video_header": "What Type of Movement Protocol Do You Recommend for Someone Working From Home?", "segment_idx": "6", "time_start": "28:46", "time_end": "32:58", "context": "What type of movement protocol do you recommend for somebody who is working from home sitting behind the computer from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM. Oh. OK. Well, a couple of things. I mean, I can make all sorts of recommendations, like get up early and move, if you can take breaks and walk, this sort of thing. But let's assume that all of that is kind of understood, that there are certain forms of exercise that we should all be doing. I think now, it's very clear based on the beautiful work of Peter Attia, whose brother is in the audience, by the way, tonight. Yeah. He's got a younger brother. He's got a younger brother. Can you imagine if Peter Attia was your older brother? Can you imagine? That'd be pretty cool. I sort of adopt people as siblings. They don't know it, but I do. But I just assume Peter was my older brother, but turns out he has a younger brother already. And Peter has essentially hammered home the truth, which is that we should all be getting somewhere between 150 to 200 minutes of so-called zone 2 cardio where we're walking a lot and/or moving about where we can just barely hold a conversation. I notice people in Toronto seem to walk a lot, so that's great. And then three days a week or so of resistance training, and there are a bunch of other mobility things that we should all do so that we don't fall and break our hips or another bone because that's another way that people really limit their health span and life span and so on and so forth. But two things that can make being at a desk-- which I loathe. Even though I like to learn, I hate sitting still. You can do the standing desk thing. I do that by stacking boxes. The other thing that was interesting-- did anyone see this study out of the University of Texas? I think it was Houston this last year about the soleus push up. Did anyone see this? This is pretty interesting. So the soleus, this wider flat muscle below the gastrocnemius of the calf, is a really unique muscle in the human body. It's 1% of the total human musculature, but it has an ability-- what will soon be for obvious reasons-- to dramatically shift fuel utilization in the body. What they did in this study was they had people who were sitting for three or four hours a day just simply raise their heel. Seems almost silly, right? They call it a soleus push up. When I called it that online, I literally got attacked by the gym bros telling me that's a seated calf raise. OK? OK. No wonder this whole bro science thing gets kind of-- people get really aggressive. They lift their heel, and they're pushing their toe down. And some people think of it as bouncing the knee, but it's really about pushing the toe down and lifting the heel. So they just simply had these sedentary people do this heel raise. And what they saw was that there was a dramatic, highly statistically significant increase in blood glucose utilization and reduction in both insulin levels during that activity and around the clock. Really interesting. What they were doing was mimicking some aspect of walking. Now, is it as good as walking? No. But if you are stuck behind-- working from home, sitting behind the computer from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, what they found was that people getting into this unconscious pattern of lifting their heel over and over and shifting back and forth mimicked a lot of the effects of walking. It's not a replacement for exercise, but the shifts in glucose and insulin utilization and output respectively were very impressive. And this group down at the University of Houston at University of Texas in Houston is starting to incorporate this into people who have limited mobility. And it doesn't seem like other limb movements can do this. There's something special about the soleus. It was designed, in air quotes, to be a muscle that's used repeatedly over extended hours of time and that has this unique pathway of fuel utilization. So is it going to cure obesity? No. But if you're stuck behind a desk, that would be something useful. I have this little fidget thing. I was too lazy to build one, but I found one online for a couple of bucks where you just when you stand at your desk and just kind of kick it back and forth. Anyone seen these? These are kind of cool. Then you just kind of kick them back and forth. And some people will treadmill at the desk. I can't do that. I can't do that many things. But I also am still working on this one. I can't quite do that. Next question, please. My morning meditation consists of--"}
{"question": "How does the author's morning meditation practice of shifting between different time domains help improve their ability to switch between tasks?", "doc_id": "eC9fiJBdMG0_7", "video_id": "eC9fiJBdMG0", "video_title": "LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman Question & Answer in Toronto, ON", "video_header": "What Does Your Morning Meditation Consist Of?", "segment_idx": "7", "time_start": "33:04", "time_end": "38:00", "context": "OK. And then I think we're about out of time. Yeah. So my morning meditation is not really a meditation, it's a perceptual exercise. And that perceptual exercise has a weird name because I gave it a weird name. And I didn't intend to sound mystical, and I don't want credit for it. But I call it space time bridging, but it's not that. To me, one of the most interesting things about the nervous system is our ability to orient in different time domains. This gets a little bit abstract. But we know from states of high stress that we start fine slicing time. We know this, right? The world becomes like a slow motion video because frame rate has increased. As a vision neuroscientist, I can tell you that in my laboratory, we were doing studies with virtual reality where we can crank up people's level of stress by giving them certain visual stimuli, and then their ability to parse information is clearly increasing in the time domain. They're fine slicing much in the same way that when you look at a slow motion video of somebody dunking a basketball or something of that sort, it's because the frame rate went up. So when we are in high alertness states, our frame rate increases. When we're very relaxed, our frame rate decreases. So if you're Rick Rubin and you're lying there looking at the sky, your frame rate is probably slower than if you're hyper focused on-- oh my goodness. Imagine a dreadful situation where somebody sends you a text message. Well, let's make it positive. Somebody is having a child in your family. And you're like, is it healthy? Are mom and baby OK? Dot, dot, dot. I mean, seconds feel like minutes. Minutes feel like hours because you're fine slicing time. OK? And then mom and baby are fine. OK, great. Happy story ending. Great. So when we're very relaxed, we tend to bend time more broadly. Now, it's also true that your visual system and your perception of time are inextricably linked such that if you close your eyes and you focus on your internal state, you are fine slicing time. And the second hand, if you will, is more or less-- the metronome, rather, is your breathing and your heart rate combined. When you open your eyes and you look at something in your immediate environment, when you move from so-called interoception to exteroception, your perception of time shifts fairly dramatically, and you now perceive time according to, believe it or not, the speed of images moving in your environment relative to you. And then as you look out further on to, say, the horizon, you extend the time domain even more. If you then imagine yourself in the whole globe, you extend your time domain even more. So my morning meditation, if you will-- it's more of a perceptual exercise-- is to step through these different time domains, to close my eyes and focus on my internal state, open my eyes and focus on something close by, look a little bit further, look a bit further, think about myself on the globe, the whole world moving. So you're really extending your space domain, and then the time domain expands with it. And this comes up when you see these little memes of, anytime you're worried, just remember you're a little dot on a little blue spinning in the universe, this kind of thing. But you don't think that way when you're stressed. You're thinking, I'm the blue dot. You're the problem. Whatever. Or I want that. You're not thinking. So this perceptual exercise is a way of training my nervous system to shift deliberately between these different time domains. And for me, it's been very useful for improving task switching, something that, as you probably have noticed, I'm not very good at. I go into the trench. I don't leave the trench very easily. So that's been very useful. And if you are interested in more detail, there's a wonderful book called The Secret Pulse of Time. And there's a Hitchcock movie that's discussed in that book. The movie is about 75 minutes long. And during the course of that movie, the background actually includes rising and setting of the sun and a bunch of different speeds of movement and interplay between the characters. And your perception at the end of the movie is that a much, much longer period of time occurred because unconsciously, your brain was paying attention to these circadian signals and these other signals. Absolutely fascinating with Hitchcock. Not a huge Hitchcock fan, but after seeing that, I was like, wow. That's genius. He captured this space time thing. What you see out the window is in one time domain. In the room is a difference time domain. I won't tell you who killed who. But it's very, very interesting. And so the point being that when your visual system is up close, focusing on things up close or internally, you're fine slicing. When you focus on things further away, you're more broadly focusing and so on and so forth. So that's a morning meditation I do-- perceptual exercise. It only takes about a minute or so. The other thing is that on the monitors, they're flashing now. That was your last question. So I want to just say a couple of things before we go."}
{"question": "How can I tell if the stress I'm experiencing is short-term or long-term, and what are the key indicators of long-term stress that I should be aware of?", "doc_id": "uwWOc_RqTBA_1", "video_id": "uwWOc_RqTBA", "video_title": "LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman Question & Answer in New York, NY", "video_header": "You've Said Before That Stress Can Be Good for Us. How Do We Know When It's Too Much?", "segment_idx": "1", "time_start": "2:17", "time_end": "7:38", "context": "You've said before that stress can be good for us, but how do we know when it's too much? That's a good question, and I should preface that by saying that there's some incredible work that was done by a colleague of mine, Dr. Alia Crum. Ali is how she goes by, Dr. Allie Crum. Who is a-- she was a Division I athlete. She's a tenured professor of psychology at Stanford. She's a licensed clinical psychologist, like everyone. So when I look around my colleague, I'm like, oh, my goodness. Who are these people? Very humbling place to be. But she's made some important discoveries, and I want to just highlight one, which is this notion of mindset. And no, these are not placebo effects, but let me just tell you. When you think about stress, how you think about stress is really important. First of all, you can't lie to yourself. But if for instance you watch a one or three-minute video, as she's given subjects in her lab about stress, and it tells you all the terrible things that stress does to your immune system and sleep, then you experience those things-- increases in blood pressure, et cetera. However, if you watch a one to three-minute video that's also true about the fact that stress can sharpen your decision making for certain kinds of things, actually, can accentuate your immune system. I wish someone had helped me get this narrative right out there. Stress does not deplete your immune system, unless it goes on a long, long time. We'll talk about what long means in a moment. Why would it? Think about it. If you had to fast and move with family or weather a storm of any kind, emotional or physical, and you got sick, that wouldn't make any sense. It's usually after you're stressed. If you've ever been go, go, go, or taking care of a loved one or studying or working hard, and then you finally go on vacation, you rest, you arrive, and you get sick, it's because your immune system shut down. It stopped. Your immune system is mobilized by that alertness side of your autonomic nervous system, but you do need sleep. You do need sleep, and it's actually, we think, the slowing of circulation. And this is why it's probably not a good idea to exercise if you're already sick, and if you're veering towards sick probably limit the intensity of any kind of interaction as best you can and just still yourself. Well, Ali's lab has clearly shown us over and over again that what we know, our knowledge base, really does shape the physiology over those outcomes. Now, you know that stress is both bad and good, so which one is it? Does it average to nothing? No. It turns out that you can bias this in one direction or the other, depending on which information you're listening to more often. I think this is really important. I still am trying to get my head and my mind around what's happened over the last few years and where it's placed us. Like where did it land us? Are we more resilient now, or are we just really beat up? I don't know. I really don't know, but I think how we interpret the last few years is going to make a big difference in terms of how it impacts us. How do we know if we are-- thanks, yeah. What we're missing out there, I think, is a narrative from somebody that people listen to. And I'm not saying that person should be me. In fact, it shouldn't be me but somebody that can help us frame what's just happened to us, much like a good-- I think the world needs a good therapist, basically. Needs a very good therapist. So I would call short-term stress, which is very beneficial for us, is the kind of stress that happens on the order of a day, two, or three days. Not a problem. Even if you feel torn apart, provided you can get rest afterwards. Long-term stress is the kind of stress that really starts to impede your sleep-wake cycle, make your dreams more stressful and more like nightmares, and they're not going away. And I can promise you that for those of you that have challenges with accumulation of stress from the past that's now compounded by what's happening now, et cetera, the solution does seem to be to get yourself into a supported environment of some kind that will allow you to go through a full catharsis. Again, it doesn't have to require psychedelics. That can take you through the full ride of autonomic intensity-- catharsis of some sort-- and then relaxation. That does seem to be what snaps people out of what we would call longer term stress and historical stress. There's even the question of whether or not focusing directly on the trauma and the story is so critical. I think it is. Obviously that's something that should be done with a clinician, but stress that impedes your sleep for three nights or more, that shifts the pattern of dreams to more anxious dreams, that is more long-term stress. And for that, you need to take it seriously, and it's the kind of thing where if you don't take it seriously, it can start degrading things like your immune system, et cetera. And I would say that under those conditions, use sleep as a good marker. In fact, I'm sure there are some clinicians in the room. I mean, one of the questions that is used as a diagnostic for whether or not people are depressed or anxiously depressed is whether or not they are sleeping well or not. Again, language is not very good at parsing what's going on inside. We have to look to behaviors and regularity of sleep-wake cycles, et cetera. Hopefully that was at least a partial answer. I tried to be accurate, but if I were exhaustive, I might actually cure insomnia someday with these podcasts if nothing else."}

If your exhales are longer and more vigorous than your inhales, you're going to get calm down. If your inhales are longer and more vigorous than your exhales, you're going to become more alert. And if you hold your breath, just eventually just start breathing again. The physiology maps perfectly to that. That maps perfectly to the physiology. And if, for instance, you do box breathing-- inhale hold, exhale holding, and this kind of thing-- well, you're going to stay right where you're at. You're going to be on an even plane more or less. So that hopefully captures all of breathwork in one sentence. Now, I'll answer the question you were asking me. Hypnosis, it's impact in my life in a couple of ways. One way is more from a practical scientific way, which is that my laboratory works on vision, and we work on stress. And in some ways, those might seem divorced. Although now with the cuttlefish and the fact that your eyes narrow their field of view when you're stressed, et cetera, it should become obvious why that is. But hypnosis also takes advantage of this really weird cool feature, which is-- and it's always weird when you do a group exercise, but I can't really see you all that well. I certainly can't see your eyes well enough to know this. But David Spiegel, there's actually something in the-- this is a valid thing called the Spiegel Eye Roll Test, and it's not the teenage eye roll. That when you look up while not moving your head-- when you look up, you actually are engaging circuits in your brainstem that are involved in generating alertness. And when you look down and your eyes close, the opposite is true. You're engaging circuits in the brain that are taking you into a calmer state. Now, wouldn't it be wonderful if all you had to do was look down and you'd be calm and look up and you'd be alert. That doesn't quite work that way. But to induce hypnosis, what they do is they have people look up, and then while looking up, close their eyes, which is actually hard to do. Some people can't do it. Their eyes roll forward, hence the Spiegel Eye Roll Test. Some people, their eyes get-- you see the whites of their eyes, and it looks really spooky, and they're looking up while their eyes closed. Those people are very prone to hypnosis. Why? Well hypnosis is a state of deep relaxation with alertness and focus. It's a contextual narrowing-- excuse me. So it's like being in early stage sleep, and that's why stage hypnosis works with telling people to do certain things. It's not that they don't care or they're under the control of the hypnotist. It's that they forget what's around them. Why? Because their mind is focused internally and on the dialogue with the hypnotist and is not paying attention to context. So it's a narrowing of context. But hypnosis for me has been very useful because A, it validated the relationship between vision and states of mind. It also checks off this box, again, which is that to access neuroplasticity, what do you need? You need focus plus you need a state of deep relaxation. Usually, first focus then sleep or non-sleep deep rest. But Spiegel and his daddy figured out because they're way smarter than I am that you can get people into that perfect state of neuroplasticity by combining them both in real time through this atypical thing we call hypnosis. So I do daily or maybe every other day hypnosis script that's about-- it's self-directed hypnosis script of about 5 to 15 minutes, usually, trying to get myself to be less pissed off about something that I'm really pissed off about, frankly. I imagine the stuff I'm really pissed off about in the screen on the left side. I think about all the things that make me feel good, and then I keep thinking about how angry I am. This is really how it goes. And then over time, I've noticed, well, you're coupling that bodily state of calm to the anger thing. This is all very hard to do in talk therapy. No disrespect to talk therapy. There's a tremendous advantage to talk therapy that I myself have benefited from it, although according to certain people in my life not enough. But hypnosis works because it's capturing neuroplasticity processes. Thank you for that question. What are the most effective protocols for boosting the microbiome? Oh. Well, here, I'm very fortunate because my upstairs"}
{"question": "What are the most effective ways to maintain a healthy gut microbiome and improve overall well-being, beyond just taking prebiotics and probiotics?", "doc_id": "uwWOc_RqTBA_3", "video_id": "uwWOc_RqTBA", "video_title": "LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman Question & Answer in New York, NY", "video_header": "What Are the Most Effective Protocols for Boosting the Microbiome?", "segment_idx": "3", "time_start": "12:56", "time_end": "18:36", "context": "neighbor at Stanford is the great Justin Sonnenburg, and he and his wife Erika run this amazing lab defining all the principles of the gut microbiome, and they have a really cool idea. I don't know if he's serious about this, but I can't help but chuckle when I think that this might actually be true. We all know-- this is definitely true-- that we all carry around trillions of little micro-bacteria. Not just in our gut-- that goes from one end of our throat to the other-- any mucosal lining. Eyes, genitalia, nose-- we have microbiomes in our nose, et cetera. This is why we're heading into the winter months being a nasal breather. That sounds like crazy new agey stuff-- be a nasal breather. There's actually a book written by Paul Ehrlich and Sandra Kahn at Stanford with a foreword by Jared Diamond and Robert Sapolsky. The book, Jaws, so these are some heavy hitters. And there's very good evidence that people who mouth breathe are making themselves more prone to illness when nasal breathing because of the microbiome. It's just a better filter for germs. So this winter and always really try and be a nasal breather all the time. One of the best ways to do that if you're not into the mouth taping thing, which people do, is to try and do some of your exercise with just nasal breathing. It'll take a little while to get used to, but I'm not good at the nasal breathing thing because I'm always talking. The microbiome is all over us and in us. It's on our skin. We're actually exchanging it when we meet and we shake hands. Do you know what happens usually in the first 10, 15 seconds? Data from Noam Sobel's lab at the Weizmann has shown that we wipe our eyes. We wipe other people's molecules on us. We're really good at that. Just watch these interactions. Now, everyone's going be doing the germ free handshake. They're going to be fist bump. But there is this idea that maybe we are the house cats. Maybe we're not just transporting all these microbiota because it's good for us. What if we're just the vehicles, and they're running the planet? And they're like, oh, we're running out of some stuff. Like we should figure out somebody to take us to Mars, and then we'll take over Mars. I mean, maybe it's all them. And Justin was the one that told me that, and I was like, that's kind of eerie if you think about it. But there might be these other intelligences that are hijacking us, and that's scary because we like to think that we're in charge, and who knows. What's good for your microbiome, or what's good for them that is? Well, prebiotic fiber seems to be very important, but the studies of fiber, at least, as it relates to the microbiome are somewhat controversial. There was a study done on humans at Stanford by Chris Gardner and Justin Sonnenburg that showed that people who eat one to four-- you have to ramp up-- servings of low sugar fermented foods. This would be your kimchi, your natos, your sauerkraut, your kiefer's, your kombuchas, et cetera. Per day develop a very robust microbiome, and fiber did not do that. In fact, fiber increased the so-called inflammatory, which is the markers for inflammation, but that doesn't mean that fiber is bad. Fiber actually is-- getting enough fiber is correlated with a number of other things that are great, like reduced cardiovascular disease, for instance, cancers of the colon, for instance-- so fiber and gut microbiota. Prebiotics, probiotics, probably only necessary if you have a dysbiosis-- if you've been taking antibiotics, or if for some reason you're depleted of the microbiome. One of the great ways to deplete your microbiome is to just eat highly processed foods, but hopefully most people aren't doing that. So prebiotic fiber and these low-sugar fermented foods, and then someone always says beer. So and always, yes. Yes, beer will support your microbiome, but it might do other things too. So in general, low-alcohol, low-sugar fermented foods reduce the number of inflammatory markers. That's very, very clear from the Sonnenburg data. And then there are other ways, of course. The microbiome, actually, interacts with temperature. So the cold exposure thing is actually good for your microbiome, but-- and I want to really emphasize this. If you hear about studies that such and such improves such and such, keep in mind that anything that improves your sleep, your microbiome, or your social interactions will improve basically everything else. And those are what we call modulating-- excuse me-- effects, not mediating effects. This is really important, and we teach first year graduate students and medical students about this. Like for instance, if there were a fire alarm pulled right now-- God forbid-- it would modulate all of your attention, but would you say that fire alarms mediate Attention No. It's not directly in the line of mechanism, but it can adjust an existing mechanism. So great sleep is great for everything, but it doesn't control it directly. And so things like getting great sleep, keeping your microbiome healthy, getting enough sunlight, et cetera-- they provide a kind of buoyancy to all the organs and systems of your body, but they aren't necessarily the thing that cures ADHD. But of course, if you have ADHD or issues with focus, getting enough sleep will help. Is nutrition the way to cure your ADHD? No, but if you improve your gut microbiome, it's very likely that your neurotransmitter systems will improve. Limiting sugar will help, et cetera, et cetera. So there's reason to think that great sleep, solid nutrition, microbiome, social interactions, exercise-- those are the big five. There are others too, of course. With those you set a good buoyancy to all the other systems, and then we get into the things of how to directly increase focus or modulate dopamine and so on and so forth. Oh. Well, I realize some people are afraid of dogs."}
{"question": "Why do people tend to prefer having dogs over cats for affection and interaction?", "doc_id": "uwWOc_RqTBA_4", "video_id": "uwWOc_RqTBA", "video_title": "LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman Question & Answer in New York, NY", "video_header": "Why Do Humans Love/Need Dogs so Much?", "segment_idx": "4", "time_start": "18:43", "time_end": "23:17", "context": "We actually have a dog stimulus in our fear lab. We get people that are terrified of dogs. We hired this dog trainer guy who has these pit bulls that will attack you while you're in VR. By the end, people are a little more comfortable with dogs in general. For you and me, if you're not afraid of dogs, that's not terribly terrifying. But if you are, even the thought of that can be pretty terrifying. A couple of things-- people have thought about the eye contact thing. They make eye contact. We're big on eye contact. Humans too. Eye contact is meaningful in terms of oxytocin release. That's all real. Those data are-- the more and more data that come out from better studies-- eye contact is a big deal. I think it's also that just the dogs are always game to show up exactly where you want to meet them, and they always show up in their most loving possible state for them. It's a pretty simple equation if you get it right. They need proper care, but-- I mean, Costello was unique because the bulldog also-- you don't want to get me going on dog breeds, but the bulldog also looks disappointed all the time. And then you do something it likes, and then it looks delighted, and pretty soon you're working for their approval. And we were like the odd couple-- me and him. And I realize he's got me trained really, really well to do my best to please him and delight him, which delighted me. And there I was on the hook. So that's one reason. I think there's also another reason, which is super nerdy, which is this C tactile fiber thing, which is you have these little nerve endings in your skin. And we know, of course, that oxytocin is released from parent and child. We know this from neuroimaging, et cetera. We know oxytocin is released from non-sexual romantic touch. One of the things that is very powerful for the release of oxytocin-- very powerful-- is non-sexual grooming touch among members of a species or even across species. So those pictures of monkeys picking around in each other, or people who insist on popping things on one another, or people who go to the hairdresser or the barber and they like touch. It doesn't even have to be massage-- massive oxytocin release. Those data don't get as much play as all the data on oxytocin and love. It's called the love hormone, but it's basically a neurochemical signaling system for this interaction, feels good, and is very much of the present. And I think that's an important distinction to make more broadly. Is that dopamine is really about the pursuit of all things beyond the confines of our skin. I'm going to get that thing. I want that because it's all about anticipation. And when you have some distance between yourself and the thing that you think will deliver, whatever it is you want, usually pleasure in some form or another, or excitement, whatever your pleasure is or combined, then you actually have to mobilize. And dopamine is the precursor to adrenaline. A lot of people don't know that. Adrenaline is made from dopamine. It gets you into motion. Then you have the reward systems that are more about what you have from your skin surface inward. So this is gentle touch, holding hands, and indeed stroking your dog. Probably does that for you. It activates these C fibers, as they're called, in your skin, which feed right into these serotonin and oxytocin system. So the brain-- sounds a little pop psychology-ish, but it's a real thing, and it exists in essentially all mammalian species. So I think a lot of us just like dogs because they'll let us just pet them all day. Some people like to be touched a little bit more or less, even when they trust is all-- it's this consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate-- in this case, species appropriate. Those are the conditions, very important. When I was a kid, I had-- I don't know why. My sister is in the audience. I don't why she decided to do this in the first place, but I loved having my face done-- pet like that. I still like it, but don't try it because she's the only one-- she can't do it anymore even. So we all have these things that feel good, and I think it feels good because it releases these chemicals. And these are ancient systems-- ancient, ancient systems that we all have, and I think dogs let us do that. And cats toy with us with this one. Because there are those cats that let you pet them, but most of the time they're doing it to you, and then they withdraw. And I don't know many dogs that do that. So I think people, I'm going to answer the question finally. I think dogs we love them so much because they let us pet them as much as we want. And cats play this very diabolical game that's a lot more like human relationships. [LAUGHTER] How can night owls best function in a society made for morning birds?"}
{"question": "Can a person with a naturally nocturnal circadian rhythm, such as a night owl, adapt to a society that is geared towards morning larks by making conscious lifestyle changes?", "doc_id": "uwWOc_RqTBA_5", "video_id": "uwWOc_RqTBA", "video_title": "LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman Question & Answer in New York, NY", "video_header": "How Can \"Night Owls\" Best Function in a Society Made For \"Morning Birds\"", "segment_idx": "5", "time_start": "23:23", "time_end": "27:00", "context": "Can you change your chronotype or do us night owls just have to suffer? OK. Well, as a former night owl, I used to work long hours in the lab. I still work long hours but less in the lab. Just so happens that's the way the career goes. I'd put tinfoil on the windows. I would lock the doors. I'd blast the music, and I would stay there over the holidays, until I had to go home just for the holiday events, and my clock would drift. So I became a night owl, and then my clock would flip, and everyone was gone. Your mind gets really tweaked when you're not interacting with anybody. By the way, seeing faces in the morning and seeing faces at some point during the day once you're ready to face the day, very important for mental health. This is something I wish more people knew about. It also-- and here, I'm not trying to evoke any sentimentality. But when you think about people who just are clearly not doing well, whether or not they have shelter or not-- it's how often do we actually make direct eye contact nowadays? It's not very often. So eye contact is important, but I've also shifted to being a morning person. So here's the thing-- if you are a true night owl, that means that your circadian clock, meaning the genes that control the area of your brain and your hypothalamus that controls wake-sleep cycles, is fundamentally different. Very unlikely you'll become a morning person without being a kind of angry morning person. So you can use that argument, and you can cite me. However, as we get older, it is true that the amount of slow wave sleep to REM sleep tends to change, and we can do better on shorter bouts of sleep, mostly because we're getting less rapid eye movement sleep. And even if we try, we can't. Those people would probably be better off sticking to a limited amount of sleep at night, and then getting a short nap. The rule of naps is nap if you want to. Don't if you don't want, but not if it interferes with your nighttime sleep. And if you can't nap, do some sort of non-sleep deep breaths or NSDRs. I refer to it as non-sleep depressed. So you can probably shift your clock by anywhere from two to eight hours, and that's true for lag as well. Light is going to be the best way, but if you really want to shift, you're going to have to stack the big three or four. Light-- so get light when you want to be awake. Temperature-- you have to increase your body temperature to wake up. You have to decrease body temperature to go to sleep. Keep in mind if you get into an ice bath or cold shower, you get very, very cold, but then what happens it's like putting an ice pack on the thermostat. Your body temperature goes up. Remember, thermogenesis-- that's the warming of the body in response to cold. Of course, if you stay in a long time, you'll get crispy cold. You'll turn into a popsicle. But the idea is that if you take a cold shower, and you get some bright light, and you get some exercise, and you drink some caffeine, you can train your system to expect that at a certain time of day-- and you'll want to go to sleep a little bit earlier or much earlier, and you'll want to wake up when you stack those things. But that also means not taking caffeine and cold showers and doing exercise late at night, so it's going to take some work. But those are the big four. It's going to be light. It's the most powerful way to shift. More light, awake. Less light, asleep. Temperature increase, awake. Temperature decrease, asleep. Food is the other one. Eating-- you can force yourself to eat breakfast, even if you're not a breakfast eater. This works when you travel too. Just get on to the local meal schedule. Because you have a clock system in your gut, believe it or not. You want to synchronize that with your brain. And then activity-- getting some sort of exercise. But it takes a little bit of work, but you can do it. You can definitely do it. If you're nocturnal, that's weird, unless it's because of your work, in which case there are tools for shift work that we've put out there on the podcast. Your podcasts has been a wild success. How do you see it growing over the next few years?"}

I really do. Lex suggested we do the podcast. That's a true story of doing it. I still really do feel very much like I did when I was a little kid. I'm just going to keep trying to learn and share. I'd love for people to share the tools. I don't want credit for them. If people credit us, great. But if you think about it-- most of what we talk about are not things that you buy. These are tools that, again, work the first time every time. I always say behavioral tools first, then nutrition, supplementation. And then for some people, prescription drugs or some of these more experimental drugs make sense. For some people it doesn't. For instance, I don't think kids should be doing psychedelics. I mean, childhood is enough of a psychedelic experience in and of itself. But I had an amazing clinician-- he's actually a triple-board certified psychiatrist neurologist at Stanford Nolan Williams on the podcast-- and he talked about even the use of ibogaine and MDMA, even in some younger populations but again, with therapeutic oversight. It blew my mind. I also didn't know this-- that MDMA I thought was toxic. Please don't just take it off the street, but if you're interested in clinical trials, there are great clinical trials happening through maps, and you can look at Nolan's website as well. Most of the knowledge about the effects of MDMA is from the LDS community because they volunteered for these studies because it's not on the banned substance list. And so there's a lot of knowledge, and they don't tend to-- or they don't use other substances, like alcohol and marijuana and cocaine. So much of what we know about the effects of MDMA on the body and brain is from that community. Other communities too as well. So what are we going to do with the podcast? Well, every Monday I'm going to keep putting out episodes, until they put me in that grave with the thing. Thank you. Yeah. It is a labor of love, and it's a lot of fun. And we're just always trying to make them better, clearer. Somehow they're not getting shorter. I always tell Rob-- this one is going to be 90 minutes. And he's like, yeah. I'll believe it when I see it. I think for me one thing that has brought that's really wonderful is the opportunity to learn from people in other domains that are far better at putting information and things into the world. So I've been-- I hope he doesn't mind me saying this. I've been very blessed-- I've become really good friends with Rick Rubin, who's been really helpful to me. He has an amazing book on creativity coming out that's not a plug for the book, although I guess I just accidentally did it. But Rick of course, is like producing. Created all this amazing music. Everything from like Run-DMC, Beastie Boys, Slayer, Johnny Cash, everything. Just amazing. And one of the things that he's been impressing on me is that it's very important to stay focused on the process of what you're doing and to really not get into too much of how that's landing. So I do like to hear when things are not clear. That's really helpful to me. I do like to hear suggestions about great people to bring on the podcast. I love criticism most of the time. I try my-- it's hard sometimes, but I really try and just absorb it for what it is. But I love that aspect of interacting in this, even though this is very fairly unidirectional. Hopefully, there'll be more opportunities for dialoguing and learning what's out there. My real hope is that practitioners will start to incorporate things. And again, it's not about me. I'm gleaning from fields and discoveries of other people and trying to thread across fields. So that's why I see the podcast going just more of the same, more of the same, more of the same but a lot more and more topics as best we can-- lots of guests. And we actually have an episode with Rick coming out at some point about creativity, which I think is one of the more interesting aspects of our being, so watch for that. What is a stress inoculation protocol for workplace anxiety (speaking)? Does the principle of staying calm under high adrenaline"}

I think if you were to pick some sort of practice that you could do privately and safely-- again, how cold should you make the water? Cold enough that it's really uncomfortable and you really, really want to get out but you can safely stay in. And that's why we never say 40 degrees because you can't kill yourself with cold water. It's just hard to do. You have to get really, really cold before you kill yourself. And open bodies of water aren't good. Actually, I told my friend Samer Hattar. He's the director of chronobiology unit at the National Institutes of mental health. He came on the podcast. Got him really-- he's great about all the stuff on light and sleep. Taught me a lot of that over the years. We're good friends. I told him about the cold water thing, and he got into some river in Bethesda and almost drowned. And Sam right now-- he has a story about how he almost drowned, and what he was-- and he thought about a paper he wanted to write while he was almost drowning. So just be careful-- open bodies of water, that kind of thing. But I think you can quickly see within about a week or so of doing some sort of deliberate adrenaline release. It could be cyclic hyperventilation, 25 hyperventilated breaths with a short breath hold, repeat, done two or three times. We have good data to support that in the lab. You see massive shifts in people's baseline level. You become a little bit more like Costello. You really do. And the way to think about it is, if you are more on a seesaw then on the continuum, you get better at loosening that hinge and controlling that hinge. Or you can imagine moving up and down that seesaw a little bit more easily. And then of course, you have to place yourself into the environment. You have to test yourself in that environment, and some people will do Toastmasters and things like that, and it can work. My way-- I don't know if it works for everybody. My way is just start talking. Don't stop. I can't feel the stress. What do you think will be the next hot topic/new"}
{"question": "What are some potential new directions in the field of neuroscience and behavioral therapeutics that could lead to significant advancements in treating mental health conditions and improving overall well-being within the next 10-20 years?", "doc_id": "uwWOc_RqTBA_8", "video_id": "uwWOc_RqTBA", "video_title": "LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman Question & Answer in New York, NY", "video_header": "What Do You Think Will Be the Next Hot Topic/New Trend in the Field of Neuroscience & Behavioral Therapeutics Within the Next 10-20 Years?", "segment_idx": "8", "time_start": "33:08", "time_end": "37:48", "context": "trend in the field of neuroscience behavioral therapeutics? Ooh, I like that because I have a lot of opinions about that. First of all, I do not think it's going to be brain machine interface. My good friend, Eddie Chang, who I've known since we were nine, he came on the podcast. He works on epilepsy. He's a chair of neurosurgery. We had a bird club when we were kids at two members. You had to know the names of all the talking birds, and then you had to know which one was the best talker, and it's the minor bird. And of course, no one wanted to join. No one even took the test. But he became a neurosurgeon and does brain machine interface. He's doing truly incredible work getting people with locked in syndrome to speak through a device implanted under the skull. They just think what they want to say. These are people who haven't moved or shared a word with anybody, and they're now communicating, but here's what's really cool and-- he has also realized that facial expression is a lot. It's one thing to see on a screen what somebody in a chair or a hospital bed is thinking. That's wonderful, but facial expression is such a rich part of this. So this is a really good use of AI. He's now created very realistic iPad images of that person's face, and so they're actually speaking the words. And people form a deep relationship to the person who's right next to their avatar, so that's a positive use, I think, of avatars, and Eddie is doing amazing work. That kind of work-- a brain machine interface neural link, et cetera, I think is going to be very useful and popular in the realm of therapeutics for Parkinson's, movement disorders, epilepsy, locked-in syndrome, et cetera. I think we are many, many, many decades from chip implantation into the brain for things like enhancing memory, and frankly I wouldn't want it. Not because I wouldn't want to enhance my memory, but because of what I said earlier. Is that the nervous system has a certain amount of real estate, and you don't want to make that real estate very lopsided. And so I think we're going to see something very different in the next 10, 20 years, and I hope, hope, hope this carries over to younger populations. I think we're going to hopefully start learning about our nervous system and what it can do. And the fact that we have these pre-existing circuits in us that we can learn to leverage that work first time every time. So I'm strongly biased in my answer, but I think that it still remains an open question, for instance, whether or not people could require less perhaps or no medication for certain things. And I say certain things because for conditions like schizophrenia, bipolar in particular medication, OCD has proved very effective. But then there are a whole other set of conditions like depression and anxiety for which behavioral tools really work, but most people just don't even know they exist. So that's my hope, and again, the therapeutic community could try and expand their toolkit. I also think we're starting to see a blurring of the lines between different fields of psychology, so it's no longer psychoanalytic versus cognitive behavioral versus dialectic versus EMDR versus hypnosis. That it's all going to be governed by some central principles. All those camps-- it's just silly frankly to me. It makes sense academically why those came to be, but in neuroscience we had the same thing. You used to have to pick. It was like a John Hughes film from the '80s. Are you going to be a jock or a punker or a popular kid. Now, it's not like that, and half this audience is looking at me like, what are you talking about? And that's exactly the point. Which is that I'll never forget I grew up in the skateboard thing. The first time I saw someone wearing skateboarding shoes, I was like, damn. They skateboard. And they're like, no. They just-- people are just wearing this stuff. So well, you start to realize it's all blended together, which is great. And in the field of neuroscience, you used to have to pick. Are you an anatomist or a physiologist? Are you into neural computation? Now, your lab has to do it all, or you collaborate with people. Those divisions have really melted because people are interested in questions, and they're interested in answers. And don't get me started, but the careerism of the requirement for everyone to have their own independent laboratory and say this is my mission, that is one of the worst things about science. Because everything we know says that collaboration collaboration, collaboration, leads to faster progress. And I'm not going to take on the whole academic system. It's been very good to me, but I'd like to see a blurring of the boundaries. It used to be that labs weren't-- here, I'm really guilty, Huberman lab. But it used to be that labs were named after the problem they worked on. Vision Lab, Stress Lab, Happiness Lab. I like that quite a bit more, but I screwed up and called this whole thing the Huberman Lab. [LAUGHTER] You have had a number of performance interests and fitness experts on your show. What changes have you made to your fitness protocol,"}
{"question": "What are some effective strategies for staying focused and avoiding distractions during long periods of work or training?", "doc_id": "uwWOc_RqTBA_9", "video_id": "uwWOc_RqTBA", "video_title": "LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman Question & Answer in New York, NY", "video_header": "What Changes Have You Made to Your Fitness Protocol That Include Nutrition That You Wish You Knew Before Starting the Podcast?", "segment_idx": "9", "time_start": "37:53", "time_end": "40:10", "context": "including nutrition? Oh. Yeah. Well, I'm an omnivore, so I like those things they call carbohydrates, and I eat them in moderation. And so I've never really been too extreme about any of this, or the fasting thing, although I do just-- I'm not very hungry in the morning. That's also because I like to eat a lot at night. I wake up not that hungry. So what have I changed? Well, in terms of the fitness stuff, I've definitely started to incorporate more nasal breathing when I do cardiovascular work because it has eliminated any sleep apnea I had. And sleep apnea is very, very bad-- very, very bad. I wish I could say snoring was no big deal, but we know based on work at the Stanford Sleep Lab, Penn Sleep Lab, other sleep labs that people who have sleep apnea are really in for trouble for a number of reasons. So you want to learn to be a nasal breather, and if-- some people will tape their mouth shut with medical tape when they go to sleep. Other people will just start doing cardiovascular work, keeping their mouth closed. And that requires that you not go too intensely, but it does create a dilation of the nasal passages. Those sinuses can dilate. So I've definitely done that. And at the end of training, I try and do a one-minute or three-minute decompress. Not immediately look at my phone to learn to shift from high intensity thinking and to lower intensity thinking and shift throughout the day. Task switching, I think, is going to be a big area of science and neuroscience in general. We still don't know how to task switch well-- how to shift the mind from focus to defocus and back again. That's something that-- by the way, this is, I think a rich opportunity for people to develop tools. We don't know a lot about that. We got too caught up on consciousness flow and free will. And that stuff is great, but as you can tell, I like tools. I like physiology. I like the things that work in my lifetime and that we can figure out and agree upon in my lifetime. Let's see. Got it. And I'm told that this final question-- when they put the clock up here earlier too, they said we're going to run it for 60 minutes. My first question was, where's the snooze button? So I'm going to keep going, but I think they're going to hold me to it. And I know, people, this is New York after all. There are other fun things to do. For things that take a long time-- career, pursuing a degree-- is there a right way to know that we're on the right path?"}
{"question": "How can I intentionally move along the continuums of focus and rest to find meaning and joy in my work?", "doc_id": "uwWOc_RqTBA_10", "video_id": "uwWOc_RqTBA", "video_title": "LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman Question & Answer in New York, NY", "video_header": "For Things That Take a Long Time — Career, Pursuing a Degree, Etc — Is There a Way to Know Were on the Right Path?", "segment_idx": "10", "time_start": "40:17", "time_end": "46:29", "context": "Is there a way to know we're on the right path? Thank you for that question. I get asked this a lot, and gosh, there's so much information out there. So much information about this. We don't yet have a gauge of whether or not we're in too much stress or not, but there is one tool that's used in the free diving community and in other communities that you can use as a thermometer of how well you're functioning. And some of you may know it already, and if you do, forgive me. It's this carbon dioxide tolerance test. So why am I answering this question this way? Well, I like to start with actionable tools. If, for instance, you were to just take three or four breaths and then take a big deep breath and then do a very slow controlled exhale-- could be through your nose or through your mouth. Ideally, through your nose. And you're trying to make that exhale as long as possible, until your lungs are empty, and you time that. That's called the carbon dioxide discard rate or the exhale discard rate. And it tells you how well you're controlling your diaphragm using something called the phrenic nerve. It also tells you how well you're managing carbon dioxide and how well you're managing stress. And if you're very stressed, that number will be very, very short. And I'm not talking about how long you can sit with lungs empty. I'm talking about an honest appraisal of how long you can control that exhale for. And if it's anywhere from 0 to 20 seconds, your stress level is high. And if it's from 20 to 40 seconds, it's moderate. And longer than 40 seconds means you have good control over your carbon dioxide system, more or less. Now, these are averages, and guess what? Has nothing to do with fitness, and also, it has nothing to do with you per se because if you do this when you first wake up after a good night's sleep, you'll have a long discard rate. If you do this after running, you'll have a short discard rate. You're not out of breath. You're just not managing the system very well. So you can touch into this every once in a while as a blood pressure reading type thing. This is very back of the envelope it's not perfect, but it works well enough that alongside things like resting heart rate, heart rate variability, et cetera, you can get a window into how well you're managing stress. Why am I answering this question this way? Well, this is something I recommend doing every once in a while, especially if you are in a period of a career or any kind of pursuit where you are feeling like you're grinding. I think once your carbon dioxide discard rate starts to really get shorter and shorter, you're having trouble sleeping, I think it's time to focus on re-establishing that buoyancy to your nervous system because then and only then can you make good judgments about whether or not you're in the right trajectory for you. Now, in terms of the larger psychological themes, are you doing something that brings you meaning or not? That gets into some complicated territory. We're very good at assigning meaning retrospectively, and saying, well, that was a good experience because we had it, and we learned from it, et cetera. But I think most people would like to avoid things that they can only look back on and say, it was useful because I learned something from it. And for that, I'll just give the default, but I think, at least to me, accurate answer, which is the more often that you can tap into that feeling of excitement and delight in your work, even if from small things or from surprising things, or from the social interactions that you're able to glean from that work, the longer and better you're going to be able to pursue that line of work. For me is in graduate school, I was very isolated. I worked alone in the lab. Maybe it was because of the tin foil I put on the walls or the windows. I don't know. In fact, my graduate advisor's one complaint was that I seemed unfriendly. I wasn't unfriendly. I was just busy, but I got to be very good friends with the janitorial staff because they were the only one around at the time I was working-- were a few other people. And those small interactions actually became very significant to me and became sources of brief-- but to me, at least, at the time, meaningful social exchange. And of course, eventually, I made friends and had relationships of other kinds and things that were healthy as well. But I think learning to tap into this love of what you're doing is sometimes hard, but you have to look for it. It's an active process, and I'll default to the work and the podcast that's coming with Rick Rubin. And he is a lot of what he talks about in terms of creativity. Is about accessing what he and others have talked about as the source. If that is an abstract, I don't know what is. But the source is this ability to see yourself as more of a portal for getting certain things done in the world than being so careerist and focused on whether or not outcomes are really matching what you need. It involves some mental flexibility, and of course, it's OK to pivot back and forth. But we can only access this feeling of delight and joy and this feeling that we're somehow connected to some larger theme, aka meaning, I think, when we are able to be calm enough and not so focused. But in order to get anything done, we have to be hyper focused, and that brings me back to the basic principle of today's whole discussion, which is that it's not about landing yourself in a state of focus motivation and drive or in a state of deep sleep. Certainly, not in a coma. It's about being able to move up and down the various continuums that allow you to access focus and real gas pedal down to the floor kind of thinking and action but then also deliberately back off transition to periods of rest. And the real key is for you to feel like you're in the driver's seat. If we know anything from the last 100-plus years of psychology and neuroscience literature, it's that if an animal or a person feels that they are in control of the physiological process within them, and they know they can get themselves out, some way somehow at some point and back into a state that they want somehow, some way, at some point, well, then, all the language around meaning and happiness and delight starts to emerge. So learn to move along those continuums. Learn to do it deliberately, and I wish you the very best of luck in it. I know it works. [APPLAUSE]"}

My favorite part of each evening, however, was the question and answer period that followed the lecture. I love the question and answer period because it gives me an opportunity to hear directly from the audience as to what they want to know most, and indeed to get into a bit of dialogue. So we really clarify what are the underlying mechanisms of particular tools, how best to use the tools for things like focus and sleep. We also touched on some things related to mental health and physical health. It was a delight for me, and I like to think that the audience learned a lot. I know that many of you weren't able to attend those events, but we wanted to make the information available to you.

Now, one thing about TBI and concussion, everyone thinks football. Guess what? Most of the TBI is not football. There aren't that many football players, they're just large so they stand out. There might be a few here this evening. Of course, football players are a concern when it comes to TBI. Most head injuries are going to be construction workers. Have you ever seen the hard hats they wear? Those, I don't even know if they are just there for show. It doesn't make sense. And that we actually have a lab at Stanford that's focused very hard on trying to solve this problem. So, construction workers, car accidents, bicycle accidents. Portland, amazing city to cycle; I'm frankly afraid to cycle. You're a small moving object around these big objects and people are staring into their little aperture on their phone while driving. I mean, whatever happened to that by the way, of not texting while driving? Somehow that just disappeared. It's like, it really has just disappeared. There was all this science showing that it's worse than drunk driving. TBI. Well, the basic rules of the \"don'ts\" apply. If you get a head injury, don't get a second head injury. But that often isn't feasible for people that need to work, continue working in construction, or that are struggling. What do we know? Well, this is a great opportunity for me to distinguish modulatory foundational tools from things that directly change your brain and nervous system the way that you want to. What do I mean by modulatory? We hear so much and there's so many studies showing that great sleep, quality nutrition, good social interactions, avoiding chronic stress, and on and on and on are important for everything; they're related to Alzheimer's, they're related to ADHD. I mean, we could do thousands of podcast episodes just returning to the same 10 things: Sleep, don't stress too much or too long, good social connection, avoid toxic people, eat good food, not too much processed food; We could have an argument all night and I don't want to have one about whether or not it's mainly plants or this. I mean, this is obviously eating high quality food is something that we should all be doing, which foods you select is a topic that is very barbed wire, and I can give only my opinions. All of that modulates your brain function, but it doesn't mediate or change anything directly. It's setting a foundation of what's possible. So we should all be doing those things, and especially people who have TBI. Now, this question relates to hyperbaric chamber. Hyperbaric chamber, there's some very interesting data. It's essentially a hyperoxygenation of the brain for very brief periods of time. I think the data on hyperbaric chamber and TBI are very encouraging. The problem is, much in the way that a few years ago, cryo was only available in a few places. And now people are doing ice baths and cold showers on their own. It's hard to find a hyperbaric chamber. They aren't just laying around, and they don't have them at spas typically, and they are quite expensive. So, yes, there are interesting and important data I think on hyperbaric chamber. You definitely want to work with a physician or somebody who is very skilled, a practitioner who's very skilled in hyperbaric chamber. They do seem to improve brain function by hyperoxygenating the brain for brief periods of time. It seems to improve a number of things, but above all, it seems to improve the quality and duration of sleep, which indirectly allows the brain to repair itself, because as I mentioned earlier, brain change largely occurs in sleep. So if you don't have access to a hyperbaric chamber, but you do have TBI, what are some of the other data? What do those point to? Well, I'd go on and on, and you don't have to get this from supplements, you can get it from food, but this threshold level of these EPA essential fatty acids. There are now so many data, so much data on the valuable role of these essential EPA fatty acids. Thresholds being somewhere between one and two grams per day of the EPA. So much so, actually, that there are now prescription forms of EPA that doctors are starting to prescribe for people with TBI. Although for most people you can get this through... You can look up and we've done podcast episodes about different ways to access this. Also functions as an antidepressant; equally good, believe it or not, in clinical trials to SSRIs once one gets over the one or basically two grams per day of the EPA. The resident expert on the internet about this is pretty extreme about the dosages, and that's Dr. Rhonda Patrick, who by the way, deserves a nod of acknowledgement and support because it turns out that before me or David Sinclair or Matt Walker or any of these guys were blabbing to the world about stuff that they had learned in the archives of science and in their laboratories, the first person in was this woman named Rhonda Patrick. As far as I know, the first public facing formerly trained scientist to start going on all these podcasts and risk her reputation and this kind of stuff that you deal with when you put your neck out there like that. And Rhonda's, I think, terrific. We don't agree on everything and it would be weird if we did, but I think she's really been the proponent of these higher doses of EPAs for TBI and for cognitive function into all ages. \"We often hear about ways to increase dopamine."}
{"question": "How can I intentionally limit my reward system to avoid over-reliance on dopamine and promote long-term satisfaction, rather than just short-term pleasure?", "doc_id": "3_auLYOilb8_4", "video_id": "3_auLYOilb8", "video_title": "LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman Question & Answer in Portland, OR", "video_header": "Are There Effective Ways to Decrease Dopamine When You Get Too Much of It?", "segment_idx": "4", "time_start": "8:06", "time_end": "13:48", "context": "However, are there effective ways to decrease dopamine when you get too much of it for certain behaviors or habits we want to break?\" Katie Hamm, I think is the last name. Thank you, Katie, for your question. Yeah, dopamine is a slippery slope. And Dr. Anna Lembke is the expert in this, and we've had a lot of conversations. She's one of my closer friends on the faculty. Unfortunately for her, our coffee discussions often last four hours or more. Her poor patients and family. Here's the thing, when dopamine is higher in your brain and body, when you've deployed it through excitement or pharmacology or otherwise, it tends to narrow your focus and make you seek more of it in that general theme that you happen to be focused on. It could be anything. That's the scary thing about dopamine. What can you do to control it and to reduce it? Well, for those of you that are engaging in habits that are healthy, maybe that doesn't require reducing dopamine. How do you define healthy versus unhealthy? Well, I think the simplest way to define addiction, at least by my mind, is that addiction is a progressive narrowing of the things that bring you pleasure. And a good life is a progressive expansion of the things that bring you pleasure. A rather simple definition, and yet when we think about the biology of dopamine, dopamine is not unique to one pursuit. It's not unique to the pursuit of sex or the pursuit of warmth when you're cold or cool environments when you're too warm or food or social media, it's just a dumb molecule that puts you into this forward state of mass, small visual aperture, and a kind of obsessive-like nature. What can you do to counter that? Well, the best thing to do is to not get into that state too long, but if you do, the best thing you can do is to try and switch off that system, not through pharmacology, but by not pursuing more dopamine. The day after a big event, the so-called postpartum depression, named of course because of true postpartum after the delivery of a child. It's quite common for people to get very, very depressed. There's a lot of neurochemical and hormonal adjustments that are occurring, but different types of postpartum depression occur; after a big party, the Monday blues, the Sunday blues, the post-whatever blues. The four month mark in a relationship is typically when dopamine starts to drop. I always tell people, just wait. I'm telling somebody very close to me right now, just wait four months, four months, four months, and also spend as much time with that person as possible. I don't know what this deal is about not spending as much time with people. I think people are afraid that the dopamine wave pool is just going to pull them both under. I think they've called that the escalator model of relationship, where you just sort of find yourself in the relationship because you went through the stages without actually deciding on them. In any event, four months seems to be the stage in which the dopamine crescendo starts to relax a little bit, not in a long distance relationship, however. We know this, right? Anticipation is dopamine, that positive anticipation, and there's a whole beautiful science of this, and I should say psychology of this. There's a wonderful book actually. The name of the book is embarrassing always, I don't know why, for me to say. It's by a psychologist called \"Can Love Last?\", which is a psychoanalytic book about this dopamine-serotonin system and the kind of seesawing back and forth. And the fact that in relationships, people often just slam on the dopamine side of things and then they hit a wall and want to break up. Or they go into this like warm, cozy, fuzzy feeling thing, and they go, \"Well, I guess the exciting part is over.\" And this idea that one could actually, or two people or however many people were in Portland could oscillate this seesaw. [audience laughing] I don't think that you want to use pharmacology to turn off the dopamine system, but for people that have a hard time sleeping and that are really in a state of agitation and constantly obsessing, the psychiatrists... One of the oldest and most effective treatments is that the psychiatrists, and this does have to be prescribed, we use a very, very low dose of a dopamine receptor blocker, like Haloperidol, which is used to treat schizophrenia. A very low dose to shut down the obsession component. The smart, well-educated psychiatrists know this as a useful tool, but this is a one time thing with a very low dose because having your dopamine blocked sucks. It does not feel good,. But not being able to sleep and being in an obsessive mode also sucks. So it's actually a very potent clinical tool. So pharmacology is one tool, but really at the far end of things. I believe that one should try and modulate their own dopamine by not rewarding one's self on a regular basis, but only randomly. Random intermittent reward is truly the best schedule of reward, hence slot machines and so on. And you should engage random intermittent reward. And I think this is also the way that we should train kids. I call it training kids. You can tell I don't have kids. You don't reward them every time. I don't believe everyone should get a trophy every time, nor should you always just reward the winners because those winners often, we see cases of this, high profile cases of this, they often crash and burn. I mean the number of high performers that crash and burn publicly and Lord knows how many do it privately is remarkable. It's 'cause their dopamine system is all messed up. So random intermittent reward is the schedule of reward that we should impart on ourselves. \"If you had 10 minutes a day to improve your brain plasticity, what would you do?"}

Well, I'm going to say again, I would absolutely anchor my physiology with morning sunlight viewing. I can't help it. Do you know what's interesting? And I'll tell you very briefly, you know what's special about morning sunlight? This low solar angle sunlight. I don't think I've talked about this much on social media or on the podcast. There's a group at the University of Washington, a couple, Jay and Maureen Neitz. They run a lab together. That sounds like a horrible thing, but they do it and they get along very well. And they've discovered that the cells in your eye, the neurons that set your circadian clock make you alert during the day and make you sleepy at night, and so on. Those cells respond best to yellow-blue contrast and orange tones. Now, this is important because when you go out in the morning, even if it's not at sunrise, but it's close to sunrise or you look at the sun in the evening, what you'll see is yellow-blue contrast or orange; yellow, blue, orange, that old thing from kindergarten or first grade. That's not the color of light that you're going to see when the sun is overhead. Now, this also is really interesting because artificial lights, at least to my understanding, even the daylight simulators have not picked up on this. It's just about bright light. Someone ought to design something that can mimic this, but nature has done this beautifully for us. And so viewing low solar angle sunlight in the morning and in the evening is most effective because of those yellow-blue contrasts. Now here's the really wild thing. Those circuits that set your levels of alertness and sleep, yes, they respond best to yellow-blue contrast, but what that tells us is crazy. What that means is that color vision was probably not related to color perception first because all of that is completely subconscious. The pathways that do this are present in people who are pattern vision blind. So, what do I mean? I mean that color vision likely evolved from a need to synchronize your internal state with the external world. And the best stimulus in the outside world to do that is yellow-blue contrast. In other words, our ability to detect color was first and foremost, and we understand this based on evolutionary genomics and so forth, to extract time of day information, not color of fruit or color of skin or anything like that. That's all secondary, which is wild and crazy. And this is yet another example of the way we think things work is not the way they work. It's completely 180 degrees opposite. I'm just going to give you a little teaser. I had a guest on the podcast, we haven't aired the episode yet. His name is Erich Jarvis, he works on speech and language. He also was admitted into Alvin Ailey Dance Company. Again, who are these people? He's a professor at the Rockefeller. Anyway, I learned from Erich, and you'll learn when that episode comes out, that you only find elaborate speech and language in species that also engage in dance and song. And the genomics point to the fact that song and singing came first and language came second. And that led me during that episode of the podcast, I wrote down in my notes, I was listening to him talk and I wrote down in my notebook, it's just scrawled in big letters. It says, \"I am so happy right now.\" I was just blown away. And it makes so much sense when you hear it, that the colors in the sky were what our system is trying to extract, not a perception of those colors in the sky, 'cause they're informing us about time and orienting us in time. That song and the communication of emotional states would be simpler and more foundational than communication about specific patterns of language. When you hear it, suddenly it makes sense. But of course we're human beings, and unless you're Erich Jarvis or Alia Crum or Anna Lembke, you think about all this stuff backwards, as I do. \"How can I navigate my way through taking supplements"}
{"question": "How can I use supplements to help align my body's internal rhythms and optimize my health when I have an irregular schedule due to my career as an Army infantry?", "doc_id": "3_auLYOilb8_6", "video_id": "3_auLYOilb8", "video_title": "LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman Question & Answer in Portland, OR", "video_header": "How to Use Supplements to Optimize Health When Career Prevents Consistent Routines?", "segment_idx": "6", "time_start": "17:54", "time_end": "21:07", "context": "to optimize my health when my career demands, Army infantry, prevent me from being able to establish consistent routines?\" Andrew Yagen, well thank you for doing what you do. Andrew, so the consistent routine thing is tough. Here's what I can say without going into a long two and a half hour episode about jet lag and shift work, which we've done. The most powerful way to anchor your brain and body in time is indeed viewing sunlight at consistent times of day. That's not something I made up. We know this based on a lot of work that dates back to the 1930s. The second most powerful stimulus is going to be movement and changes in body temperature. In particular, increases in body temperature tend to make us alert, and decreases in body temperature tend to make us sleepy. Body temperature drops one to three degrees to get us into sleep. Why does a cold shower wake you up? Adrenaline is released and believe it or not, your body is heating up internally to combat that cold, unless you make yourself hypothermic. So, sauna, hot baths to get sleepy, cold showers, ice baths, et cetera to wake up. Sort of obvious when you hear it, but it's counterintuitive because you think, oh, heating up the body to wake up and cooling down the body to go to sleep. So getting into cold ought to cool me down, but your body compensates just like if you threw a cold towel on a thermostat, you'd crank up the temperature in the room and vice versa for heat. Okay, so what do you do? You want to try and use as many of these things, light, temperature, exercise, food. When you eat is typically associated with waking. Very few of us are capable of eating in our sleep. And then the other one is social activity and rhythms. Now the discombobulated person is going to be the person that has not aligned these things in a consistent way. So while schedules vary, and Andrew, I don't know your exact schedule, what I can say is if you suddenly go from daytime behavior and sleeping at night to the so-called vampire shift, as it's called in the military, and suddenly you're up in the middle of the night and you're sleeping during the day, then when you come off that shift, what you want to do is try and combine as many of those same things at one time. So it would be get your sunlight, so go jogging without your sunglasses, drink your coffee, engage with other people and communicate, eat a meal afterwards or as the case may be before. Try and bring as many of those things together at the same time of day for a few days and pretty soon your system will map around that. So the reason I encourage for those of us that are not doing shift work to try and be fairly consistent about sunlight viewing is it sets in motion everything else that's correct, in terms of timing of eating, appetite will follow, when your alert will follow. You'll start to learn your own rhythms. When you can't control your schedule, try and combine as many of those cues; again, light, temperature, exercise, food, social engagement into one period of time and try and lock that into a more or less a one or two hour period or plus or minus one or two hours at a particular time of day for at least two or three days. And your schedule, meaning your internal clocks will lock to that. \"How is social media changing our brains?\" Thomas Adcock."}
{"question": "Is it possible to reverse or prevent the negative effects of excessive social media use on our brains, particularly in terms of nearsightedness and cognitive abilities?", "doc_id": "3_auLYOilb8_7", "video_id": "3_auLYOilb8", "video_title": "LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman Question & Answer in Portland, OR", "video_header": "How Is Social Media Changing Our Brains?", "segment_idx": "7", "time_start": "21:12", "time_end": "25:01", "context": "Well, you hear all the terrible ways in which it's changing our brains. And I think that again, we go back to this thing, is it the aperture that we're looking at? So is it the format that we're engaging in things? Or is it the content? Well, the way I like to think about the phone is the way that we've been engaging with the phone and the laptop for that matter, in staring into the small visual aperture each day is sort of like walking like this all day long, right? We have this amazing ability to shuffle our feet and take small steps or to take big strides, to run, to move... I think that's the sagittal plane for movement. I know it for the brain, but I always mess it. The PTs are vicious people online, by the way. The PTs and nutrition people, I've learned to just not say anything about that. I'm not a PT and I'm not a physical therapist. And they do incredible work, but they're like, it's a very spirited crowd. [audience laughing] And the nutrition thing is really weird. I mean, it's just incredible. People are either throwing liver at you or they're throwing celery at you or they're fasting or they're not fasting. It's nuts. In any case, the social media and staring at a small visual aperture is changing our brains. Here's one way I know in which it's changing our brains and then I'll tell you how to fix it. If you stare or look at something within two feet of you for a certain number of hours each day, your eyeball actually gets longer. And the visual image then is focused in front of your neural retina, not onto your neural retina, and you are becoming myopic; nearsighted. And if you look at things in the distance enough, guess what? Your eyeball changes shape and your lens will focus appropriately the image onto your retina. It takes some work. Kids that look at things up close too much, and adults that look at things up close too much become nearsighted. And there's a beautiful set of clinical trials now where mainly in kids, if kids get outside for two hours a day, getting a lot of this UVB and blue light that we're told is so terrible for us, but they get it from sunlight, they actually can reverse myopia, or reduce the incidence of myopia, maybe even glaucoma. Although that's a big maybe. So, how much staring into a small visual aperture is too much? I don't know. But what we do know is that we are literally becoming myopic in terms of our vision and we're becoming myopic in terms of our cognition. And then there's the whole business of what's actually contained in those Tweets and those social media feeds and those news stories. Which frankly, I feel like you lose either way, whether or not you're in one political camp or another political camp, you're upset about half of the information out there. So I feel like, and I'm not someone who knows how to talk about politics without stumbling, I didn't do well in social studies in this sort of thing. It just never made sense to me. It just felt like the prize goes to the person who can shout the loudest and the most coherently for a moment. But I encourage, of course, people to be politically active. And I vote. But the content is tricky to navigate. And I can't really speak to that, except that it seems to be bothering everybody on one side or the other or in the middle. And the format is something that we really understand. And again, I don't know of many people that are talking about this narrow visual window format thing. It came up more during the lockdowns when we were all inside a lot and not looking out at a distance. The data say really to try and get at least 10 minutes of long distance viewing, so longer than 10 feet away from us, for every 30 minutes of closeup viewing. And not a lot of us are doing that. If you're walking to your car looking at your phone, you're definitely losing an opportunity."}

Mateo Minato. Ooh. I think the piece of neurological research that I... All right, the weird stuff. I've got this colleague at Stanford, Tony Wyss-Coray, and they're really into literally taking proteins from young blood and young spinal cord cerebral spinal fluid and putting it into older people and animals, and they get younger. That stuff's pretty wild. The fecal transplant stuff is pretty wild. You take the microbiome from one person and as it sounds, you transplant it to somebody else and they take on the physical characteristics of the donor. It's crazy. Until I talk to my [chuckling]... There's some shouts for fecal transplant. Nice. [audience laughing] I have never read the method sections of those papers. I'm actually afraid to read the method sections. I would say this is not neurological, but the work from Chris Gardner and Justin Sonnenburg, also at Stanford, it makes it sound like I just like, \"Stanford, Stanford, Stanford.\" But these are the people I'm closest to and surrounded by. There are excellent places everywhere, of course, including OHSU and I'm not just saying that 'cause I'm here. I actually close colleagues here and friends here at OHSU. Also an amazing, although that tram thing freaks me out, it's like I always just have all these ideas about what's going to happen if that thing breaks. But the microbiome data are really interesting. I never understood why getting your gut microbiome was important. And it turns out it's because your gut actually makes many of the neurotransmitter precursors that your brain uses. So that's pretty cool. And I always thought it would be a complicated thing to get your gut microbiome right, but it turns out that it's fermented foods that seem to have the biggest effect. There was all this argument about fiber and yes, fiber is important and here I'm getting nervous talking about nutrition, 'cause the people are going to come at me with fiber. But it's very clear from Justin and Chris's data that people who are getting four servings a day of fermented foods, whether or not it's kimchi or sauerkraut or kombucha, that stuff actually seems to encourage a healthy gut microbiome and people feel better, and their immune system works better. And I like this because it actually, it resolves an issue which is that high dose probiotics, these very expensive need to be refrigerated things, those actually can create brain fog and other issues there for real severe cases of dysbiosis. So I always like an instance where one can look to foods which are good, 'cause I like to eat, in order to resolve these issues. In terms of other neurologic issues, frankly, I think the stuff on dopamine is fundamentally important. So much addiction, that's a severe case, but also so much waxing and waning of motivation. And once you understand the dopamine system and you say, \"What activities am I engaging in or pharmacology am I engaging in? What am I doing to spike dopamine?\" You start to go, \"Oh, I get it. The waves in this wave pool are too high and that's why I can't do this consistently.\" And then you do the counterintuitive thing of approaching things with a little less excitement, but then you're able to do them more consistently. It's like, \"Ah!\" And maybe with some luck, I'll end up finishing this book that I've been working on for four and a half years as a consequence 'cause I can't seem to."}

How is it really working? What process is happening in his brain?\" Oh, boy. Madison Cameron and everyone here probably familiar with Wim Hof. Whose occupation on Wikipedia used to be \"Daredevil.\" That was cool. It's like Evel Knievel had it and Wim had it. I got a story about Wim. Actually in 2016, I heard about this guy, Wim Hof, and I got a hold of him, actually his children. And I had one vacation that year and I flew to Spain and I spent some time mountaineering with Wim, which was absolutely terrifying. I almost lost a leg legitimately. I tied in wrong on a bridge sling. He told me it was good for me. He told me to, \"Stare into the lizard's eyes.\" And I stared into the lizard's eyes. I jumped backwards off this homemade bridge sling thing. And I had the rope wrapped through my leg and I came back with basically the tendon on the back of my knee exposed. And sitting next to me on the plane was our Vice Dean of Research at Stanford. And I had to explain to him what I was doing and why. It was very embarrassing. What did we do on that trip? Well, a couple of things that will help me answer your question. First of all, when I arrived, I suffered terribly from jet lag, but the moment I got there, Wim did not say hello. He literally told me to get into the ice bath. And I did 10 minutes in the ice bath not because I'm tough, but because he held me down in the ice bath. He is indeed one of the strongest human beings. He reminds me of the bus driver on \"The Simpsons\" or the janitor, excuse me. No, Otto is the bus driver, right? The janitor on \"The Simpsons,\" like that guy. That's Wim. Incredibly physically strong guy. What do I think's going on with Wim Hof stuff? Well, Wim Hof, whether or not he understands it or not, I always think he's sort of the Bob Dylan of breathwork. Like everything he says seems to have some intuitive sense, but you don't really understand what in the world he's saying. He's going to come after me now. We've had a good but complicated relationship, I'll just confess. Maybe someday we'll resolve that. No big scandal or story there, just we communicate very differently. Wim has a couple methods. One is to deliberately hyperventilate. This is also called Tummo breathing. My lab actually studies this. We have a paper that I'm happy to share with you the results although they're not published yet, where people do deliberate cyclic hyperventilation. Which as the name suggests, you just breathe really deeply in and really deeply out 25 times. Or if you're Wim, you'd say, \"In and out. In and out.\" I just tell people, here's how it works. You go [deeply breathing]. You do that 25 times and you heat up and you feel really agitated, and that's because of adrenaline. If you throw yourself into an ice bath or a cold shower, adrenaline. If somebody upsets you or you get a triggering text, adrenaline. Adrenaline sounds like a terrible thing, except when you deliberately induce it. As my colleague, David Spiegel says, \"There's a big difference between going into a state and you controlling your entry into a state.\" So it's not just about the state you're in, it's about how you got there and whether or not you had anything to do with it. States of high adrenaline are very powerful. When you self induce adrenaline by cold shower, cyclic hyperventilation, AKA Wim Hof breathing or Tummo breathing, you then have an opportunity to create a very distinct mind-body relationship. We all hear that interoception and the mind-body relationship. Interoception just your ability to sense your heartbeats and what's going on in your body. Powerful, right? Terrible if how you feel sucks. So interoception is wonderful, but when you're anxious it actually is more adaptive to be able to maintain your thinking and get yourself out of that anxious state. So if you're trembling and your body's freaking out and your cheeks are flushing and your brain is following your bodily state, well, that's not good. And if you're somebody and sadly, this happens a lot where you've experienced a lot of trauma or typically this is people that have been bombarded with extreme criticism or physical abuse or other kinds of abuse during development. They actually can seem very calm, but internally they're freaking out in their head. And they're just thinking, just get me through this. And they just go into a state where no one knows they're upset. I've known people like this and it's eerie to me because I've never had that response to stress, but it's very common. And so we should learn and be careful about deciding that people are in one state or another based on their bodily or their mental response. Vim Hof breathing, cold showers, et cetera, are a great practice in my opinion, because they allow you to spike your adrenaline. And you can do that, for instance, by making the water colder if you want more adrenaline, staying in longer if you want more adrenaline, moving your limbs around in the water will give you more adrenaline 'cause it breaks up that thermal layer. It makes it a lot colder. Or doing 50 deep inhales and exhales. That is very useful because then you have the opportunity to use that prefrontal cortex and to stop and sense all that adrenaline in your body and yet maintain clarity of mind. And that's an absolutely powerful tool. I would even call it a power tool. And Wim figured this out. I don't know if you know this, but the way that Wim discovered all this was he was in deep grief about the tragic death of his wife. She committed suicide, jumped off an eight story building. Just truly tragic death. And he was in situation, he had four children at the time. Now, he has five. And he was in a state of depression and he ended up going into the canal in Amsterdam and it was very cold and it shocked his system. And in that shock to his system, which is caused by adrenaline, he somehow was able to anchor his thinking and in kind of genius of sorts, Wim thought, \"Wow, I can intervene in my physiology with this strange activity.\" And then he realized that breathing would do it as well. You didn't have to get into cold water. And then, years later, we discovered, not we meaning my lab, but other labs, that when you get into cold water, even just 60 degree water, that there's a very long lasting increase in dopamine. That is 2.5x above baseline, which is on par with some prescription drugs for increasing dopamine. So when people laugh at me and go, \"Oh this cold water thing,\" I get teased a lot on the internet. I've heard on the internet that I eat sticks of butter, which I never said. I said, \"I like butter.\" I've been told all sorts of things. I've been told I eat sticks of butter. I don't know why. I've been told that I'm dead. That was an interesting one. That was one of the cooler ones. But when I was going out there as a serious scientist and saying, \"Using deliberate cold exposure.\" You can use all sorts of things. Or if you come to my lab, I'd be happy to put you in VR and expose you to all sorts of scary stuff. Or we can inject you with adrenaline or you can inject yourself with adrenaline and titrate that, adjust the levels of that. So it's a very powerful tool. And I think that Wim and others deserve credit for really tapping into that. And as a last point, there's a beautiful study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences years ago using this deliberate cyclic hyperventilation thing; 25 breath [deeply breathing]. And then another group meditates. And then they inject them both with E. coli. And the people injected with E. coli who meditate get nauseous, vomit, diarrhea, and they get a fever. And the people who first, far fewer symptoms, if any. Why? Because adrenaline actually suppresses a lot of these innate immune responses in a way that's healthy in the short term. This is why you can work, work, work, work, work, where you can study for finals, or you can take care of a loved one and then you finally stop and rest and go on vacation, and then you get sick. Stress activates your nervous system and in doing so, it activates your immune system. Makes perfect sense when you think about it. How would we ever go through famine if you're just getting flus whenever you're stressed? We can deal with a lot. My suggestion is if you're coming off a period of high stress, to do some sort of adrenaline spiking behavior as you taper out of that stressful period, not going strictly to massage, vacation, and yoga nidra all day long, as I would reflexively do. \"Can red light therapy help treat exercise intolerance"}

This is another case where I thought, \"Oh no, this red light stuff is crazy.\" And then I went into the literature and it turns out that in 1908, the Nobel Prize was actually given for phototherapy. So, there we go again. And I have this slide, I chose not to use slides tonight, but I have this slide that shows Ken Kesey and the magic bus and stuff from the 1930s, and psychedelics and people getting into cold water. And then here we are, 2019, 2020, you've got Wim Hof, and Matt Johnson giving people macro doses of psilocybin. We're right back where we were. And one of my major goals is to really try and create some scientific discussion around these things. This stuff is crazy on the face of it, but there are mechanisms that are real that underlie it. Red light, because it's long wavelength light, longer literally as opposed to a short wavelength light, can penetrate through things like skin and can indeed change mitochondria. One of the more impressive results on red light comes from my good friend, Glen Jeffery's Lab at the University College London. I've known Glen for years, and a few years, he was a basic vision scientist. And a few years ago he started using red light. He'd have people look at red light at a distance of about two feet in the morning. So is long wavelength light. And sometimes even just take a flashlight, a torch as they call it in England, and cover it with a red film. And they would look at this stuff for a few minutes each morning, and it can reverse some forms of age-related vision loss and macular degeneration. How we now know it can prove mitochondrial function in photoreceptors by reducing what are called reactive oxygen species. Here's what's interesting, it only seems to work in people older than 40, and it seems to only work if you do it within the first three hours of waking. And the incredible thing is you can do this for one or two minutes a week, and some of the positive effects last as long as three weeks. And it's affecting a very specific form of visual improvement, which is acuity, kind of fine detail stuff in a particular wavelength. So, particular colors and objects and things. Pretty impressive. So, yes, red light can improve mitochondrial function to the photo receptors. If you are going to try and do this stuff, don't put it too close. I don't have any affiliation to any red light panel company. So I can't say anything there. They are rather expensive. Nowadays, people are putting red light everywhere, and I do mean everywhere. People are putting red light on their stomach for improving ovarian function, whether or not it can penetrate isn't clear to me all the way down there. People are trying to do this. I have a friend, I won't name him. Recently, he told me he is really into the red light therapy. He's putting it on his testicles to try and increase testosterone. But he told me that after he handed me the red light. [audience laughing] True story. My team knows who this is. It's no one on my team. Thank goodness. I was like, \"Oh, that's super interesting.\" I actually don't think you want to contact the red lights directly to your skin. So red light is powerful. I don't think we have, aside from the vision protocol, I don't think that it's clear which protocols are best. I will say if you're into red light infrared sauna. Typically those don't get hot enough. Typically if you want to get the benefits of sauna, you want to get between 80 and 100 degrees Celsius, which is 176 to 210 or 208 Fahrenheit. And I don't actually do the conversion in my head. I memorize it. \"You mentioned the consequences of blasting your brain"}
{"question": "Can overdoing ice baths lead to an extreme low in dopamine levels?", "doc_id": "3_auLYOilb8_11", "video_id": "3_auLYOilb8", "video_title": "LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman Question & Answer in Portland, OR", "video_header": "Is It Possible to Over Do Ice Baths?", "segment_idx": "11", "time_start": "40:41", "time_end": "46:07", "context": "with too much dopamine. Is it possible to overdo ice baths while following the same line of thinking? Will you experience an extreme low in dopamine with too many ice baths?\" Lucas Ancke, thank you for the question. Any behavior that spikes adrenaline, you will eventually get better at tolerating it. You will become cold adapted and you'll become comfortable at high adrenaline states. And you just have to ask yourself this, it's just like lifting weights in the gym or running. You need to leave some space for improvement. So if you run, as people do, and you do your 5k, then you're 10k, then you're half marathon, maybe a 10k is a half marathon. I don't know. But anyway, then you're doing your marathon. Then you're doing ultras that are 50 miles and 100 miles. I mean, eventually you're going to start doing damage, right? And eventually you look at every ultra runner and typically these are people who are very much on the dopamine pursuit system. I mean, I don't think that he would mind; my good friend and a podcaster who I have tremendous respect for is Rich Roll, amazing human being, and also has an amazing story about addiction. He was an alcoholic. And I'm not sharing anything that he hasn't already shared in his amazing book, \"Finding Ultra.\" He got really into running, running, running all the time and there's a dopamine history there for him. Some of us can use ice baths so consistently and making it so cold and doing them longer and longer that indeed you're playing with the dopamine system. Is it bad? Well, it depends on what you're trading that in for, at the expense of what? Is it giving up cocaine? Yeah, great, stick with the ice bath. But you know, can only make it so cold and you can only stay in there so long before you become Wim Hof, right? And it worked out for Wim, but there's really only one Wim Hof. And in general, that speaks to a larger theme, which is I love the idea of people using tools and understanding mechanism. I mean, of course I love that. It's what I talk about and think about so much in my life. But for most of us, we don't make a living doing those things. And so I do think that the ideal situation is to have behaviors and tools that you intersperse throughout your day and throughout the week. For instance, I think three times a week is fine for the ice bath. No one said you had to do it every day, but you should see sunlight every morning if you can. Just because if you miss a day, your system will be fine, just spend twice as long outside the next day. Seriously, 'cause it's a slow integrating system. But for most of these high intensity things, the less often you do them, the more powerful they are. In fact, if you get into a very hot sauna for four 30 minute sessions on one day. So you go 30 minutes, get out for five minutes. 30 minutes, get out for five minutes. 30 minutes, get out for five. Two hours a day in the sauna, that's a lot of sauna, but the growth hormone release from that type of protocol is a 16x increase in growth hormone. This has been measured in humans. Whereas if you do it every day or three or four times a week, you get diminishing returns on that. So I actually am a big fan of doing really intense stuff only every once in a while. This is also why I only take one long run per week or one long hike. First of all, I don't have time for it. I'm not an ultra runner. I got other things to do. And second of all, it's a strong stimulus. I'm sore until Tuesday, or I don't want to run until Tuesday anyway. I actually think that's fine. And I actually encourage kind of more healthy, rational schedules of these kinds of behaviors. There's no rule that says you have to do something every day, even if you're trying to engage neuroplasticity. You can learn French or an instrument by practicing three times a week. As long as your practice is very focused, right? Daily perhaps would be better, but very few of us have the opportunity to do things every day consistently. And I really want to encourage a more balanced approach. \"Before working for Thrasher, what's the best...\" Oh, goodness gracious. The skateboarders are always in the house. My first non-biological family was a skateboarding community. When I have great relationship with my parents now, but because there was a time when there was no one to go to soccer games or do any of that stuff, the skateboard community took me in 'cause there were no parents involved. It was great. There were no referees or coaches 'cause I didn't like authority and it was awesome. And there was no nutritional plan. You drank your slurpy and you sat on the curb, and it was fantastic. I don't do that anymore. But the skateboarding community's one that I've remained close with. I did write for Thrasher under a different name while I was a postdoc to make some extra cash. You won't find those articles anywhere, I hope. They're not very good. And the best skate trick? Well, I was involved in it enough that this will only makes sense like three people in the audience, but I had decent heel flip. I could nollie better than I could ollie. And I was never very good. Oh, there's more skateboarders in the audience. What I will say though, is you have to be very careful with skateboarders, 'cause I don't want to claim that I was any good. Any success that I had was out of sympathy of others for letting me hang around. It's a great community. And it gave me great appreciation for indeed communities of kids that don't have structure and sports leagues and teams and all that kind of stuff. Nowadays, it's actually a much different landscape. And I have to also say that it's really amazing to see all the incredible girls and women skateboarders also. There were none. It's an Olympic sport now for women and girls, and it's an Olympic sport for boys of men too. So, it's awesome to see that community.

Yeah, hard things. Well, I'll be honest. I learned how to hack into my adrenaline system a long time ago through the worst possible mechanism, which is that I would set up battles in my mind. I would get into competition with people, imagined or real, or I would get into states of fearing shame and screwing up. So, this is what a lot of people do I think, you end up scaring yourself into trying to do the hard thing, and it works. The problem is it feels rather like a downward spiral because those negative states of mind work to liberate adrenaline and get you through hard things. So being a kind of rebellious kid, resistance was... If someone told me I couldn't do something, I was like, \"Yeah, try me\" and this kind of thing. And as I mentioned before, I wasn't crazy about authority. And so, that was the method for a long time. And then, I started reading Oliver Sacks's books and I started learning from people who seemed to access things through this whole love thing. And I tried that love and kindness meditation thing, and that didn't work. And what I started doing was I actually, I'll just tell you before I came out here tonight and before I do anything challenging, I just actually like to imagine the people that have supported me. It's a weird tool. I don't think I've ever shared. I'm actually slightly embarrassed to share this out. 'Cause there are only two things that make me cry, and that's talking about my bulldog and talking about my graduate advisor. And if I talk it about any longer, I'll probably cry. But I think about them a lot because they were kind of similar. They were kind of ornery and they were hard on me, and I adored them both. And so these days I try and think about people that really, that I love. And so I have been trying to do this whole, like, doing things from a place of love thing. And so, for me, that's animals and people that I love. And okay, now, I better move on. Ah, thank you. Okay, they're telling me one more question. So I'm going to answer one more."}

We just recorded an episode on grief. It hasn't come out yet. Fascinating topic. I realized at one point, by the way, I'll just give this away, that I thought I was really sad about losing them. I thought I would tear up really easily because I was sad about them. But then I realized that this, gosh, I can't believe I'm going to do this. But I realized that feeling that I was feeling is the exact same feeling of love that I had when they were alive. So, grief is love. And when you look at the literature, it's basically that, but your brain is freaking out because that map of knowing where people are in space and time, grief is basically a remapping of the space: Where are they? Time: When are they? And then, this kind of abstract map representation that we call closeness. And grief is this process of ripping ourselves off of that. So, in any event, what do I fear? Talking about things like this. What do I fear? Quite honestly, my biggest fear, the thing that would just make me feel just horrible is I fear letting down my friends. I have an amazing... I love my family and they're wonderful, but I have this incredible relationship to friendship, and I adore my friends and I would sooner give up all my limbs and die before I would deliberately let them down. So, there you go, that's what I fear most. Thank you."}

My favorite part of each evening, however, was the question and answer period that followed the lecture. I love the question and answer period because it gives me an opportunity to hear directly from the audience to what they want to know most, and indeed to get into a bit of dialogue so we really clarify what are the underlying mechanisms of particular tools, how best to use the tools for things like focus and sleep, we also touched on some things related to mental health and physical health. It was a delight for me and I like to think that the audience learned a lot. I know that many of you weren't able to attend those events, but we wanted to make the information available to you. So what follows this is a recording of the question and answer period, from the lecture in Seattle, Washington. I hope you'll find it to be both interesting and informative.

{"question": "What is the difference between Non-Sleep Deep Rest and traditional deep relaxation techniques like Yoga Nidra?", "doc_id": "2Ds1m5gflCI_3", "video_id": "2Ds1m5gflCI", "video_title": "LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman Question & Answer in Seattle, WA", "video_header": "What Is Your Most-Used Protocol?", "segment_idx": "3", "time_start": "2:16", "time_end": "4:11", "context": "\"What is your most used protocol?\" I'm assuming that you mean the protocol that I use the most. I genuinely do the morning sunlight viewing. And this evening I went and looked at the sunset, every single evening, and I absolutely do 10 to 30 minutes of some Non-Sleep Deep Rest protocol, every single day, every single day! The reason I called it Non-Sleep Deep Rest is because while I love the classic traditions of, and things like Yoga Nidra, my fear was that if I called things Yoga Nidra, that people would get spooked. But I also have to say that I rather loathe the fact that scientists use so many fancy terms, that it also vaults information from the very people that fund the work. So I have a kind of an ax to grind with the scientific community too. So Non-Sleep Deep Rest was my attempt to kind of put my arms around a number of different things like Yoga Nidra, which I have great reverence for, and other tools like that. I do that usually in the early afternoon, or if I wake up first thing in the morning and I haven't slept enough, or not that well, I'll do 30 minutes of Yoga Nidra and I feel terrific after that. I'll just mention a brief anecdote. I learned about Yoga Nidra while researching a book that I never wrote, that may or may not ever be published. I went and spent a week in a trauma center and addiction treatment center in Florida and saw some amazing work, of some amazing people, and some amazing transformations and it was a big part of their daily routine, for these people to do Yoga Nidra and Non-Sleep Deep Rest and I thought they're really onto something here. So almost religiously for me, every day, 10 to 30 minutes. Not that it matters, but the CEO of Google's really into NSDR. I don't know him, but he's written about that a number of times. \"In Seattle, sunrise varies from 4:30 AM to 9:00 AM, depending on season, are you recommending to vary"}
{"question": "Is it necessary to adjust my daily wake-up time with the changing seasons to improve my mood and overall well-being?", "doc_id": "2Ds1m5gflCI_4", "video_id": "2Ds1m5gflCI", "video_title": "LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman Question & Answer in Seattle, WA", "video_header": "Should You Vary Wake-Up Time Seasonally?", "segment_idx": "4", "time_start": "4:16", "time_end": "6:03", "context": "your wake-up/outside time with the seasons?\" Somewhat. You know, you don't need to see the sun cross the horizon. That would be great, but not everyone can wake up with the sun. You want to get so-called low solar angle sunlight. Why? 'Cause of that yellow-blue contrast that we talked about before. Many people wake up before the sun is out. If that case, if you want to be awake, turn on as many bright lights as you can. Up here, I don't know, does anyone here, you don't have to admit this if you don't want to, but maybe nod or raise your hand if you're comfortable with doing that. In the winter you feel less well, or typically in the transition, yeah, it's huge up here. It's really, it's amazing. And then when you're on campus or that's where I've spent time and you see Rainier and it's like, the blossoms are out and you feel almost high because that's dopamine, you know, animals that have white pelage in the winter, and then it turns dark in the summer and spring months that pathway, the melanin pathway, is from tyrosine, which is the precursor to dopamine and also to melanin production in the fur. So the whole system is linked. It's not rigged, it's linked. So what do I suggest? I suggest in the winter months, getting 30 minutes of sunlight viewing. I know it's a lot, but it's much better than feeling lousy all day. And then the real key in the winter is to try and catch some sunlight before it goes down. If you're indoors and it goes down and then you go outside and it's dark, your brain and body don't really know where they are in time. And then you flip on \"Ozark\" and you're watching \"Ozark\", and then you really don't know where you are in time. I have one more episode. Don't tell me what happened. That show is, when I was a postdoc, I used to recommend, \"The Wire,\" to my competitors. True. \"I go to sleep fired up, ready and excited to do whatever it takes."}
{"question": "Do you often wake up feeling drained and depleted, and is there a way to adjust your sleep schedule to feel more refreshed in the morning?", "doc_id": "2Ds1m5gflCI_5", "video_id": "2Ds1m5gflCI", "video_title": "LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman Question & Answer in Seattle, WA", "video_header": "Why Is My Drive Depleted Upon Waking-Up?", "segment_idx": "5", "time_start": "6:09", "time_end": "8:38", "context": "When I wake up, that drive is depleted. Why, and what can I do?\" Interesting. Have not heard that one before, but if I were to venture a guess, you know, we didn't spend much time tonight talking about the autonomic nervous system, this kind of seesaw that takes us from very alert, potentially panicked, but to very, very deep sleep; even, you know, God forbid we go into a coma. It's 'cause the parasympathetic nervous system is overactive relative to the sympathetic nervous system; the seesaw of autonomic function. You may be sleeping very, very deeply. And when you are in deep, deep rest, the last thing you want to do is get into that forward center of mass thinking, planning, predicting, right? In, you know, again in Yoga Nidra again, Non-Sleep Deep Rest, there's this common theme in the script of going from thinking and doing and predicting to being and feeling, they say. And I'm not making fun of them as the moment I hear that, I go, \"Oh, just I want to be and feel.\" What are you doing? You're actually just moving into sensation, but no planning, right? There's nothing mysterious about it. Sensation, but no planning. Now in sleep, a very deeply parasympathetic sleep state, what's happening? You actually, that visual aperture is actually so big, you're not in panoramic vision, your eyes are actually closed. Space and time are from past, present, and future are invited into your thinking. You're in a deep, deep state of relaxation and it may be, Dustin, that when you're waking up, you're having a hard time transitioning out of that because you're sleeping so deeply. You may be waking up mid-sleep cycle. Many people find it useful to set an alarm so that they wake up at the end of a 90 minute so-called ultradian cycle. There's some sleep apps that do this on the phone. I can't recall their names, but so rather than sleeping seven hours, you might be better off sleeping six or seven and a half hours, right? Waking up at the end of one of these 90 minute cycles. Try that. That would be consistent with what we know about the biology. But I think it's common to, if you sleep very deeply, to wake up and not necessarily want to spring out of bed. I've heard of these people that just want to spring out of bed and attack the day; Jocko Willink, 4:30 in the morning, his Casio phone, and his watch. I'm seeing his watch when, and it's like eight for me. I'm like, \"Wow,\" like again, these people are amazing. I must be doing something wrong. But these are, you know, I don't wake up that way. You know? Like Tiger, I'm like, I want water, I want sunlight, 90 minutes later I want caffeine. Yeah. \"What are some of your favorite books"}

Gosh, so many! You know, for non-fiction, well, Oliver Sack's autobiography, \"On the Move,\" had a profound impact on me. You know, people hated him? The scientific community tried to kick him out. They said horrible things about him; created all sorts of scandals. It wasn't until \"Awakenings\" became a blockbuster movie that suddenly he got appointments at NYU and Columbia. Ha! Then now they wanted him back; the revered neurologist. Like incredible, right? But he was also a real seeker in the cuttlefish thing. And he had a lot of internal struggles too, some of which I relate to, some of which I don't. Actually, I've been in touch with his former partner because I actually moved to Topanga Canyon for a short while just 'cause Oliver lived there. I thought, \"If I go there, I'll actually finish this book.\" Guess what? Just moving someplace doesn't allow you to finish a book. He lived in Topanga so I was like, \"That's the key.\" It didn't work. And people were wondering why I was hanging around their house all the time 'cause it was Oliver's former home. So that's an amazing book, and tells you my obsessive nature. The other books that have had a profound influence on me, I would say in the non-fiction realm, well I learned how to make a decent steak and a few other simple recipes, not well, from Tim Ferris's book, \"The Four Hour Chef,\" 'cause I really needed help. That was a fun one. I like Robert Greene's book, \"Mastery,\" because I've had amazing mentors and that book is all about finding mentors and assigning mentors to you, even if you don't know them. And as you can tell from my stories about Oliver, who I never met, and a few other folks, that I've just decided that they don't know it, but I'm mentoring them, that they're mentoring me, excuse me, that book was really important for me. And that mentor-mentee relationships always involve a breakup, either by death, or by decision, or by consequence, to your circumstance rather. There's, something happens, and they're supposed to break. You're not supposed to apprentice with somebody forever. That was an interesting book for me. I would say in the fiction realm, [Andrew sighs] I would say in the fiction realm, it's all childhood books 'cause it's been a long time since I've read fiction. I read a lot of poetry. I'm a big Wendell Berry fan. I like poetry because poetry to me is, is like the subconscious, it, the structure is all messed up and you think you understand what they're talking about but you don't really know. And so it always feels important and consequential, even though, you know, it's your own interpretation. And then I love the psychologists. I love Jung. I love Erikson. I love the psychologists and could read endlessly about the early days of attachment theory and things like that because I find that stuff to be fascinating. So those books have been a lot of fun and I love picture books with animals. [audience laughing] And so if you can get a hold of Joel Sartore's Instagram account, the \"Photo Ark,\" he decided to take pictures of every animal on the planet, especially the ones that are endangered. He's a amazing photographer, but his books are even better so if you like animal books. \"What excites you most about the future research of mental health treatment,"}

Michael, thank you, Michael. Well there, I think that we're in an exciting time. I am, I'll just reveal my biases, I'm quite pessimistic at the idea that we're going to have better medication soon for most things. What I do think we are starting to approach is a time in which we understand how broad categories of drugs impact broad categories of chemicals, which kind of shift our mind in broad categories of directions. What does all that mean? I think we're starting to realize that because there are different receptors for all these chemicals all over the brain and body, that that side effect-less drug is unlikely to exist for mental health, but that the combination of, maybe some pharmacology, but especially behavioral tools, people actually learning how to drive this thing that we call our nervous system is potentially helpful, maybe very helpful. Now in cases like schizophrenia, autism, and I didn't put those next to one another for any reason by the way, OCD, eating disorders, and I'm very mindful of the fact that, you know, anorexia is the most lethal of all the psychiatric disorders, right? Amazing and sad fact. I think for those conditions, we are soon going to enter a time in which it's going to be combination behavioral, drug therapy, and yes, brain-machine interface. I don't mean putting chips down below the skull. I think there's going to be, and there are things happening now of people using devices like virtual reality, as well as transcranial magnetic stimulation, placing a magnet on a particular location on the head combined with a particular, maybe drugs, maybe psychedelics, maybe not, to enhance plasticity. I urge a vote for psychedelics and I want to make a serious point about psychedelics. Five years ago, when I, well, four years ago when I started doing a bit of public-facing stuff, I was absolutely terrified to say that word; terrified. I thought I'd lose my job. I really did. I thought, \"Don't say psychedelics.\" And I'll be very honest, you know, I, for me, I think that the clinical data on MDMA and on psilocybin are very interesting, very interesting. I don't think they are the first and only pass at rewiring the brain, but it is clear that the brain can enter a state of heightened learning capacity, but it needs to be directed towards something. The goal of opening plasticity, just, it opens plasticity. That's not the goal. It's like running; the goal isn't running. The goal is to run in a particular direction. So what I think is really needed is to drive that plasticity in particular directions. And I would love to see more directed use of those in, of course, the safe clinical setting where it's appropriate. And a guest on the podcast, Matthew Johnson, who's at Johns Hopkins, I asked him, \"What's the deal with the microdosing?\" And you know what his answer was? I was very surprised. He said, \"Macrodose.\" And I thought, okay, I'm not a guy who, you know, I'm not into, I'm not, I'm not a pushing this. I'm not a proponent. I said, \"You're kidding me. Why? Why would you say this?\" This guy runs an NIH funded lab at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. I thought, \"Why?\" And he said, \"Because the one session with a trained professional that's triggering rewiring plasticity, that's guided, is,\" as far as they know from the data, you can go back and listen to, these are his words, not mine, but he's the expert in this area, \"are encouraging plasticity in a particular direction.\" And he thinks that that's far more useful than just kind of nudging the system a little bit without any particular goal or outcome. Very interesting, and very surprising. And again, a trained academic at one of the most elite institutions in the world. I think we're in very exciting times, for those compounds. And they're like, there are studies at Stanford and elsewhere on ketamine and other things, but it's early days. Young people should be very cautious, young, young people, and adults should be cautious, especially people with preexisting psychiatric issues and people who have a propensity for addiction although some of those compounds are being used to treat addiction. So I'd be an idiot and I would be lying, if I didn't say that it is a very exciting time for psychedelic therapies. [audience cheering and applauding] \"Where do you see the biggest area?\" and I've done only one clinical trial. True. I was a part I took part in one clinical trial. So I don't speak from a lot of experience there, just a little bit. I was a subject in that trial. \"Where do you see the biggest area for performance enhancement"}
{"question": "What are some non-destructive ways to access creative states and improve performance beyond just getting proper sleep and nutrition?", "doc_id": "2Ds1m5gflCI_8", "video_id": "2Ds1m5gflCI", "video_title": "LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman Question & Answer in Seattle, WA", "video_header": "What Is the Biggest Area Tor Performance Enhancement?", "segment_idx": "8", "time_start": "17:28", "time_end": "21:37", "context": "within the elite athletes and operators that already hit marks of proper sleep and nutrition?\" Meg Young, thanks for your question, Meg. Yeah, I think that, well, first of all, very few of them hit marks for proper sleep. But for those that do, so once you have your sleep dialed in and you got your nutrition dialed in, and the motivational component is there, I think where there's a lot of work still to be done and where people can really get outsized effects, is in this weird little cavern of human existence that we call creativity. And I didn't have time to talk about it tonight, but there's a very unique brain state that we call creativity, which is taking preexisting neural maps and starting to combine them in unique ways to create new ways of performance. Performance can be basically summarized in any domain as essentially four stages. You have unskilled, skilled, mastery, which is when the brain can generate movements or cognitive computations that are, create very predictable outcomes and then there's this fourth tier, this fourth layer, which is virtuosity. And virtuosity, by definition, means inviting back in a component of uncertainty. What this looks like in terms of operators or this looks like in terms of athletes, or even we can say musicians, or people who are in the cognitive fields, or poets, or writers, is what it means is introducing that uncertainty about what's going to happen next and the way to do that is to destabilize the system. In other words, to create states of mind in which there are literally sensory disruptions. It's like, like what I would like to see is more training in a kind of \"funhouse of mirrors\" type environment. That's when you start to see incredible performances emerge. And virtuosos invite in uncertainty, they actually don't know what they're going to do next. And so this becomes a little bit of a vague concept and what I'm about to tell you next might seem a little silly, but one of the best ways to access creative states is to, no surprise, use your visual system to view things that are highly unstable and uncertain. I don't just love fish tanks; I love staring at videos of aquariums in Tokyo, and actually watching the fish because it's completely unpredictable. There's some evidence that doing things like that or people would say, \"Oh, I was in the shower,\" or, \"I took a walk in nature and then I had this idea.\" I actually don't think it was the walk or the shower, it's that nature is filled with unpredictable visual stimuli, auditory stimuli. When you can predict what's going to happen next, you have very little opportunity to uplevel your game so to speak. It's only by way of unpredictable sensory input that you can do that. So if you're a coach, or you're working with people who are very high level performers, do you want them to stand on one leg and spin around and then do what they're doing? Not necessarily. What you want to do is try and get them into brain states that are different than the brain states that they're in when they normally enter their practice. The liminal state between sleep and waking, excuse me, the liminal state between sleep and waking is a very powerful one for accessing creativity. Many people access ideas as they're waking up in the morning, they have great insights, other people while strolling in nature. I don't think it's the strolling or the waking up. I think it's the lack of, as we call it top-down regulation on rules. You are able to access combinations of neural maps that are unusual. So you can play with this a little bit. A lot of people throughout history have used compounds, drugs, to do this, right? Great writers would get drunk and then try and write or wake up and they would, the amount of self-abuse that people including athletes and creatives put themselves through to try and capture these windows of cognitive ability is pretty intense. And I don't think that's a good idea. I think one should be an explorer and try and find these cognitive states in ways that are non-destructive. I'm starting to sound like my mother, with all this."}

One of the reasons we built the podcast with the help of the great Mike Blabac is because I learned a long time ago that if you want things done right, and you want to do them outside the lane lines, and you want to have control over how things come across, you do it with skateboarders, 'cause I didn't come from a community where, you know, I didn't have parents at my sports games and things like that so, thanks to the skateboarders and the misfits and the those folks. \"Do you have any tips on how to improve memory?\" Yes, Ron Vered.

This is a wild literature and I love it and it's changing the way that I do things. I thought that to remember things you're supposed to get really, really excited, really focused, and remember them. Guess what? That's not how you do it. There are data, and there are stories going back to medieval times that they used to teach kids things and then throw them in the river. There's a beautiful Annual Review of Neuroscience written by the late James McGaugh, a brilliant researcher who taught me that, in this review. And it turns out that if you want to remember something you want to spike adrenaline after you acquired that information, after! That means the double espresso and the ice bath after you study for math, immediately after. And you think about this, you know, that makes perfect sense, right? Think about the one trial learning that nobody wants to experience, which is a car accident or some traumatic thing. You didn't get the spike of adrenaline first. You got the spike of adrenaline after. So again, you know, I discourage the use of excessive stimulants or you know, anything like that. But if you're going to try and remember information, you need to get your brain and body into a high autonomic arousal state. Literally you need to deploy adrenaline into your system after you have made the attempt to learn some information. So much so that if you give people a beta blocker after learning emotional information, they don't learn it as well. Incredible, just incredible data in animals and humans. This is the beautiful work of Larry Cahill at UC Irvine and James McGaugh. So that's how I would focus on remembering things better. And it's also true that if you tell yourself that something's really important to you, you'll be able to learn it better. If you meet people and they tell you their name and you forget it two seconds later, well, you should probably be thinking, and now I do this, I meet people and I think, \"Okay, what terrible thing did this person do?\" Just try and spike my adrenaline or something like that. It's a terrible trick, but haven't figured out a better way, but that's actually one data-supported way to do that. Easily a dozen or more studies in humans on that very topic."}

Oi, well we should be careful with the use of the word addiction because here, I think it's entirely appropriate. When you are engaging in a behavior over, and over. and over again, and you're thinking to yourself, \"This isn't even that interesting,\" you're officially addicted. That's the litmus test for addiction. Not, \"This feels so good.\" People talk about the dopamine hits of social media. Those only come at the beginning, but then when you find yourself scrolling, you're like, \"What am I doing?\" Maybe it's that narrow visual aperture; you're a hypnotized chicken, but maybe also you are seeking more dopamine hits because guess what? That dopamine wave pool is depleted, at least for that activity. It is true that dopamine, you have a baseline and then you have peaks on, on that ride on that baseline. I do think that we can have dopamine for one behavior, and not for another, but it's a generalized phenomenon. So how do you manage it? You have to stop seeking within social media.

We recorded a podcast recently and it, so I, I don't want to go into too much depth now, about attachment and grief. And, you know, we all have a map now, you know, you understand what the maps are, of space, time, and a dimension called closeness to everyone that we know space, where they are, time, when they are, dead, alive, when will I see them again et cetera, and closeness. And the phone has allowed us to tap into space, time, and this closeness map, which define all our attachments, on a very regular basis. So you can understand why it's so valuable to people. You know, the plane lands and everyone's texting. The planes, take off, everyone's texting. It's like, \"Where are you?\" Well, the plane's in the air, there's this thing called flight tracker. No one cares about that anymore. You want to hear from the person. So I do think that, I used to do an every odd hour of the day my phone was off, and like half the relationships in my life disappeared. They couldn't talk, they couldn't tolerate it. I loved it, but I loved them too. So I would say take breaks. And I would say at least an hour. And if you find yourself excited to get back on the phone, that excitement, that is the dopamine system. So you can kind of learn where it is for you. But if you find yourself scrolling mindlessly and it's not doing anything for you, you are driving that wave pool down, down, down, down, down, so hopefully that analogy will help. It's weird to call myself Dr. Huberman. In my business if you refer to yourself in the third person, it means you're officially a narcissist."}

No, the, I asked myself that question. I was excited, and I think I'm good at lying to myself and telling myself that autonomic arousal that might be nervousness is excitement. But in truth, I wasn't, I was and am really excited to tell you all these stories and about biology. I know this might sound like a little bit of a line, but I actually don't feel myself as a, like a person when I do the podcast or I do this stuff. I took a walk before I got here and I have to be careful. There are only two topics that make me cry. One is talking about my bulldog. The other is talking about my graduate advisor. So I have to be very careful, but I took a walk and I imagined that they were here and, I know, and don't make me cry. Lex Friedman made me cry on a podcast and it was really unfair. And he was like digging and digging and there are a few people in the audience that know Costello. And it's like, you know, and I just kept thinking to myself before coming in here, like, you know, I love them and miss them and I, Costello would be entirely bored with this whole thing. So I distracted myself a bit and not so nervous. I do get nervous about things, sure, I'm human. But when it comes to biology, I think I still feel like that little kid who just wants to tell you all this stuff, you know, so, you know, I can't help it. \"Is learning from failure equal to learning from success? Is one more efficient than the other?\""}
{"question": "Does having a consistent string of successes make it easier to learn and grow, or does experiencing failures on a trial-by-trial basis help the brain learn and adapt better?", "doc_id": "2Ds1m5gflCI_13", "video_id": "2Ds1m5gflCI", "video_title": "LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman Question & Answer in Seattle, WA", "video_header": "Is Learning from Failure Equal to Learning from Success?", "segment_idx": "13", "time_start": "29:15", "time_end": "32:16", "context": "Rachel, thanks for your question. Well, on a trial-by-trial basis, we know that when you fail at an attempt, on the next attempt, your forebrain is in a position to engage better. And this makes total sense, right? You feel that frustration and you want to get the next one, right? Well, you're harboring, or I should say funneling more neural resources, your focus, that aperture tightens. Now you have to be mindful of that too, because when you have a failure and then you're like, you're going to hit the bulls. I'm thinking about a dart board, 'cause I'm terrible at darts, you know, sober I'm terrible at darts. I don't even drink. So that next trial, part of the problem is, is that focus can narrow so much that you can start to lose access to information that might help you. If you were just to relax a little bit and dilate that focus a little bit, but in general, on a trial-by-trial basis focus is the cue that your nervous system is going to be positioned to learn better on the next trial. Now in terms of life experiences, gosh, I wish for everyone fewer failures and more successes, but you know, failures keep you humble. And I've had a lot of 'em. I mean, if people ever wanted and they, you know, I'd be happy to tell you about, I mean, I've made a ton of mistakes in life, a ton of mistakes. Some of those were mistakes of persistence, like dumb decisions. I kept like, \"It's going to change. It's going to change.\" And it's clearly never going to change. And then some were failures of misjudgment about other people or situations. And a lot of them were just plain failures like the experiment didn't work, or the, it just wasn't the right thing. And you try and reframe those. I do think that we owe it to ourselves and to the people that we know to try and generate some wins here and there and try and help other people generate wins. You know, in running a lab over the years and I still do, you realize that you want your students to publish a paper and feel that success pretty early so that they can experience, A, how much work it is so they pick problems wisely, but, B, so they can feel that, like, \"Oh, I can do this.\" And I think that, you know, this gets into the psychological as well. I think that yes, failures help, but successes help. And there, I think, you know, I function best in a team. And I think that for those of you that are feel like you're fighting some challenge alone, I do think that there are great resources to be had in trying to access other, you know, other people as sources of support. I think that that's a great tool. There's this whole literature, scientific literature, around social connection and how that can help us reframe motivation and goals. Anyway, maybe that's a topic to expand on another time. But failure is important on a trial, trial by basis. People who don't experience enough wins for a long period of time, the brain is a prediction machine after all and they start to predict failure so takes a bit more work to wedge oneself out of that."}

{"question": "What are the essential supplements that support foundational health, according to your experience?", "doc_id": "2Ds1m5gflCI_15", "video_id": "2Ds1m5gflCI", "video_title": "LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman Question & Answer in Seattle, WA", "video_header": "Discuss the Supplements You Take", "segment_idx": "15", "time_start": "33:32", "time_end": "36:23", "context": "There's a joke that my friends used to tell about the supplements I take. They used to say, someone would say, \"What supplements do you take?\" And they would just go, \"All of them.\" I don't take all of them, but I have been very systematic. For about 30 years, I've been interested in compounds that change the nervous system. And I do think that the, the events of the last few years have changed the way that people view supplements. I think that more people are starting to think about how to take better care of their health. And they, people are realizing that obviously, great sleep, mindsets, social connection, exercise, nutrition and so forth are very important. But I, I actually don't know anybody, granted, I run with a strange crowd, but I don't know anybody that doesn't take something nowadays. You know, I could go through the whole list, but I would say the most fundamental things and there's no product pitch here, the most fundamental things are the things that are going to support your kind of foundational health. So for that's going to mean mainly getting either by food sources or supplements is going to be getting sufficient amounts of these essential fatty acids. So important. For some people that's taking liquid fish oil, for some people it's a capsule, for somebody that's eating fish. I don't like the way fish tastes unless I'm in Seattle, by the way, the seafood here is amazing, not so much in California. So I think the essential fatty acids, and then I'm big on the data, dare I say, out of Stanford, Justin Sonnenburg's lab and Chris Gardner's lab that these fermented foods of which all these cultures have interesting fermented foods, kefir, and sauerkraut, and kimchi, and, you know, pick your fermented food. That those seem to really encourage health of the gut microbiome. So I started eating a lot of those and taking no probiotics except in, you know, a few of the supplements that I was already taking. So I'm not trying to dodge the question, but I think, by and large, if you're eating well and doing the other foundational behaviors as well, you can get it way with a minimum of supplements. D3, it seems to be a lot of people deficient in D3, but not everybody. So I think that those are the main ones. However, I do think that nutrition should be the primary entry point. Again, it should be behaviors first, then nutrition, then supplements, then prescription drugs, only if you need them. And then, you know, for some people, their brain-machine interface like TMS and things like that are going to be useful, but behaviors change your nervous system, no supplement actually rewires you or changes your nervous system: behaviors do that. I hope I didn't dodge that question entirely. I do take some of the things that we talk about on the podcast to do some focused work, sometimes alpha-GPC, but lately I've been doing this whole thing of cold water exposure to spike my adrenaline, 'cause I hate it, and it spikes my adrenaline after learning based on the McGaugh and Cahill data."}

We try to sleep sometimes.\" Thank you, JD. Oh great. You're at UW, JD. So, you know, I used to teach this course at Cold Spring Harbor on career development for scientists and the there's a lot in there, but the two things that are most important are, I, for sake of answering this question, I would say, are, find non-destructive ways to reset your dopamine and your energy levels and do those at least every three days. So for me, it was kind of a, a tough thing to take a long walk, or to spend, I used to work really hard on Mondays, really hard on Tuesdays, and I would not go in until the afternoon on Wednesdays and sometimes not at all. And then I go in Thursday, Friday, and work really, really hard and then not at all on Saturday and then maybe do a little bit of work from home on Sunday. And I was very productive that way. But those breaks are absolutely key and it's not encouraged so much in academic or tech or maybe anything now. I hear about so much stress and overwork. I say, you just do it and define the culture and let the results and your focus be the thing that defines you, not how many hours you're in there. But I realize there's a huge cognitive load and energetic load and for that, I do think these Non-Sleep Deep Rest protocols are where it comes in really handy. There are at least two faculty I know at Stanford. One whose a so-called Howard Hughes investigator, who is big, those are big deal appointments. They get tons of money, et cetera, et cetera, and they do amazing science most of the time. These individuals certainly do. And they take two 20 minute naps, per day, in their office. When this guy came and visited me, years ago when I was at a different university, he took the time that we were supposed to meet in my office and talk about data, he asked if he could take a nap. And he gave a great talk that afternoon. So there you go. I do think you have to take control of your schedule and do those things. And I hope that helps. And then of course, for some people, exercise and so on is the way they reset. \"What research or work are you doing or that your colleagues are doing that you're most excited about lately?\" Glen, yeah.

We did a very large scale study during the pandemic, we meaning David Spiegel and I, and an amazing PhD named Melis she now has two last names, excuse me, Balban, Yilmaz Balban. And Melis we essentially equipped people with remote monitoring devices and measured sleep and heart rate variability and a bunch of stress and bunch of other things. And we gave them a very brief set of breathing protocols and it turns out that this thing that I'm talking about a lot on the podcast, these days of this double inhale, long exhale, the so-called, \"physiological sigh,\" was the most effective breathing practice for allowing people to control their heart rate variability, reduce overall heart rate, access better sleep, and these were extremely short protocols. So I'm very excited about this. I didn't discover physiological sighs. I love the idea that people can do a very brief protocol, once a day, maybe even just while walking down the street or in the moment and actually learn to control that autonomic seesaw better. So I'm very excited about that. And then we are gearing up to do some studies on people who have more severe forms of anxiety and panic attack, using mainly respiration, but also looking at some of these eye, vision-related ways of controlling the nervous system. I love that stuff. If I keep talking about it, I'm going to give you a data presentation so I'm going to turn around. \"How does dopamine"}
{"question": "Can the use of dopamine-stimulating substances like Ritalin, Adderall, or cocaine actually lead to long-term changes in the brain, or is it just a temporary high?", "doc_id": "2Ds1m5gflCI_18", "video_id": "2Ds1m5gflCI", "video_title": "LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman Question & Answer in Seattle, WA", "video_header": "How Does Dopamine Factor into Neuroplasticity?", "segment_idx": "18", "time_start": "40:24", "time_end": "43:06", "context": "factor into neuroplasticity if at all?\" Colin, great question. It's a very strong trigger of plasticity, so much so in fact that there's some work that shows if you stimulate with an electrode, the brain area that releases dopamine, and you pair that with anything, anything, even just like an eight kilohertz tone, the brain remaps and it's like, \"Oh, I love that eight kilohertz tone.\" Remember dopamine is dumb, and is just dumb. And it is just, you know, it's like Costello when he sits this dog, I could hang a rope from a tree. This dog was so lazy he wouldn't cross a room for a steak. You had to give the steak to him, but it would run across a field. He would run and jump on and hold onto that rope, and he would sometimes bite through his lip with like blood dripping down. And I was like, \"Oh my gosh,\" it was like breaking my heart. He loved every sit, that's dopamine; turns us into idiots. He was as smart about what he needed to be smart about. Dopamine. So if you trigger dopamine release with Ritalin, Adderall, to a lesser extent L-Tyrosine, and certainly please don't do this, but cocaine, amphetamine, whatever you're doing seems super interesting. It's true. And that's why it's such a slippery slope. It makes anything you're doing seem interesting and important. And actually I'll use this as an opportunity to say something about the psychedelic thing earlier. One of the issues with MDMA, it's a very unusual brain state: it's high dopamine, high serotonin, completely synthetic compound. There are other things in there that it does as well. One of the problems with people I see with the problem with people just taking MDMA, just at a basic level, is that if you're not pushing that towards some therapeutic outcome, music sounds amazing. Everything feels and sounds amazing, but it's a very neurochemically, you know, severe state. So that's why I think if people are going to explore those things, do it as part of one of the university-supported clinical trials. One of the reas- those drugs make everything seem interesting, even stuff that's not terribly interesting. Now they also have the potential for trauma healing capacity. These are the MAPS studies and so on. So you have to be very careful with what you pair with dopamine and what you pair dopamine with. And for those of you that are high sensation seeking, novelty seeking, and everything's interesting to you, and you want more, and more, and more, experiences, I, you basically have a eight cylinder car in you and you need to be very careful how you drive that thing. Like any high performance automobile, it's going to spend more time in the shop, so learn to drive appropriately."}
{"question": "What's the most important thing to keep in mind when deciding whether to share scientific knowledge with the public?", "doc_id": "2Ds1m5gflCI_19", "video_id": "2Ds1m5gflCI", "video_title": "LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman Question & Answer in Seattle, WA", "video_header": "What Advice Do You Have for Future Scientists?", "segment_idx": "19", "time_start": "43:12", "time_end": "46:42", "context": "\"What advice can you offer to future scientists who want to make an impact like you have?\" Ryan O'Boyle, get tenure first. No, I'm kidding. So I have this weird history in science and I'm not looking for sympathy here, but my undergraduate advisor, who I adored, he's like a father to me, my graduate advisor, and my postdoc advisor, who I also adored, all three of them died: suicide, cancer, cancer, really young. So the joke in my field is you don't want me to work for you. But in all seriousness, all three of them had a really morbid sense of humor, all amazing people, but it is this kind of weird curse that I've had. So what scientists, you know, what advice, you know, well, Ben Barres, the late Ben Barres died of pancreatic cancer, an amazing individual. They're actually making a documentary about Ben's life. He's transgendered. He was a totally irreverent. He said whatever he thought. He offended everybody. He was awesome. Brilliant too. Ben and I had a conversation as he was dying. I recorded a lot of conversations with him and I told him I was interested in doing public-facing education. And he said, \"Well, you're tenured now and, people are going to be upset, and they're not going to like it, and your colleagues are probably going to hate it so whatever you do and you better make it good.\" And I was like, \"Wow, that doesn't really help much, Ben.\" And he said, \"You know, you seem to have a compulsion for it.\" So, he was right. I think that if you are excited about science, and sharing what you know, then do that. And even if it seems super nerdy, I mean, there are these ento- I think they call themselves entomologists, the insect people, they, I mean they make insects seem really, really cool. And if you are excited about spindle kinetics or whatever, you know, tell people about it, I really mean it. I think that the one caveat is that I do think it's important to get a formal, rigorous training in it first. I think that you'll go further and faster in the long run. And there's some amazing people out there. There's a postdoc at Stanford. I think his name is Ben Rein, I think if you shorten it up on Instagram, it's actually brain, brein, 'cause he works out he talks about brain science so that's why it's weird: B B R E I N. He does a great job. And he's a really good example of someone who's still on the ascent with his career, doing serious science, and doing science communication. But you have to be careful, it's time consuming. Look, you, people will dislike you for whatever. I made the mistake once of saying that I eat butter. Apparently that's a sin on the internet. I like little bits of actually like a lot of butter, but try and eat little bits of butter. But somehow it's like, there's this idea that I eat sticks of butter. So you have to be careful. Like, I mean, the things I've heard, I heard I was dead. That was cool. So you have to be careful and remember everything is stamped into the, the cloud now and the metaverse or whatever it's called. So I would say, here are the rules that we have at the podcast and on here's the rules that I created for myself. I truly don't do it for me. I do it 'cause I think people want to hear about it, but I've been telling myself that since I was six years old. The other thing is never, ever, ever do it just for your own gratification. You should really try and think, \"Is anyone going to get anything useful out of this, potentially?\" That's the goal. If you're doing that, it'll work out for you. If you are thinking about how to get followers or something like that, it ain't going to work out. That's my advice. \"Is age 66 too old for neuroplasticity?\""}

Did I pronounce that right? Thank you, Sandra. No, Richard Feynman, the great Richard Feynman, taught himself to draw later in life. He was also really into flotation tanks. Did you know that? Yeah, he was also into bongo drumming naked on the roof at Caltech. Richard Feynman, you know, did so many things that would get most people fired nowadays. He's just lucky he was alive when he was. You can absolutely learn at 66 and way beyond. There's an amazing study from Rusty Gage's lab at the Salk Institute years ago, showing that even people who are very late in life, terminally ill in fact, are still producing new neurons in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. These people that were gracious enough to allow researchers to inject them with dyes that would label these neurons for analysis postmortem, after they died. Absolutely you can learn. What's harder is focus. Oftentimes what's harder is sleep as well, but the same mechanisms apply. There's no evidence whatsoever that neuroplasticity disappears at any stage despite what Hubel and Wiesel told the BBC. \"How do you tackle reading research papers?"}

I do. I take notes on everything. I try and so I there's four questions that we teach students and that I think that I use. The first one is: \"What's the question they're asking, major and more specific?\" Second is: \"What did they do? What are they, like methods-wise, what did they do?\" You don't have to know all the details in the methods necessarily, but be versed in those methods, but you have to kind of understand like, are they looking at mice? Are they looking at humans? Is this a, you know, did they have people in two different conditions or just one? You have to understand what did they do, then you ask, \"What did they find?\" And then the last question is the most important one and you should write down the answer to this is: \"What did they conclude?\" And then you look back at the first question and you go, \"Did they actually answer that question, or is it something unrelated?\" And those four questions are essentially the way that I parse each paper. Learning to parse papers is tricky for the podcast. I use the telephone. I call people and I badger them and I ask them, you know, \"Like who's doing the really good work in this area?\" And I spend a lot of hours doing it. And then the best way to remember science is to tell someone about it. So before each podcast I'll call someone and be like, \"Hey, did you know that they used to throw kids in the river?\" After, I do this, and my sister, my poor sister, and she's like, \"Yeah.\" My sister, by the way, does not watch the podcast. I, she's a therapist. And she's like, \"Hey, I learned this amazing breathing technique.\" I was like, \"Oh yeah, really? Tell me about it.\" And it's like, someone else is there. I'm like, \"You know, I have a podcast.\" She's like, \"I don't like your podcast.\" You know, it's older sister, it's older sister. It's, she's not lying."}

For people on medication, I think work with somebody really good who's willing to work with you to allow you to find that minimal effective dose, and also timing that dose. One of the key things that we know now is that from that waking up point in your morning until about eight or nine hours later, we've sort of named that phase one of the day for lack of a better naming protocol. The systems that release cortisol, dopamine, and epinephrine, are essentially more effective at producing those than they are in the later periods of the day. Which makes sense if you think about the way that the autonomic nervous system works, et cetera. So there's an important question that I can't answer for you, but you can answer for you, which is if you're using Ritalin, Adderall, Vyvanse, these things that enhance dopaminergic transmission, Modafinil, Armodafinil, by the way, for the people in the audience like me, who didn't go to college when these things were all in use, the numbers of people that use these compounds, on and off prescription, is astronomical. It's incredible. I didn't realize it. I think something like 80% of college students use these at some point. Incredible, 'cause they put you into a narrow aperture tunnel of concentration. So you want to, with a physician's support of course, to help, get permission or not, to figure out what time of day to take your medication. Now for people who are not on medication, I'll just go right back to what I said earlier, which is that you can train focus, but it feels terrible to train it. It is hard. Again there are these large scale studies in China and elsewhere of people literally teaching themselves, and yes, they blink, although less often, to focus their vision on a narrow aperture and to really battle through that agitation, stress, and learn how to keep their focus. Now focus will drift, right? Focus is not a constant; focus will drift, and you pop out of focused states and then refocus, and pop out, and refocus. That's something that you can train up. I've heard from many people who have managed to train themselves off medication or to lower doses of medication, and look, some people can't do that. They absolutely have to maintain their standard medication protocols. This is a larger discussion, obviously, as it relates to ADHD. We're going to do another episode on ADHD because the data are coming out so so fast. \"What future episodes are in the pipeline?\""}
{"question": "What are five simple perceptual exercises that can help improve focus and concentration for teenagers with ADHD?", "doc_id": "TO0WUTq5zYI_2", "video_id": "TO0WUTq5zYI", "video_title": "LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman Question & Answer in Los Angeles, CA", "video_header": "What Occurs in the Mind/Body When You Have ADHD? Are There Ways to Address It Without Medication?", "segment_idx": "2", "time_start": "2:23", "time_end": "11:51", "context": "What occurs in the mind body when you have ADHD? Are there ways to address it without medication? Thank you for this question. So attention deficit hyperactivity disorder used to be called ADD. The hyperactivity part is a little misleading. And again I'm not a clinician here. Here's what we know works for some people, and yet there are always going to be side effects of any kind of chemical manipulation, which is that, we know that people, kids, and adults with ADHD actually have a tremendous capacity to focus if they like what they're focusing on. You take a kid with ADHD who can't focus and you give them their favorite video game and they are a laser. The threshold to access the dopamine system is higher. And dopamine has this incredible ability to focus the brain and other aspects of the nervous system. Certainly, if people require medication, I'm not going to tell you to stop taking that medication. But the focus training exercises that have been explored mainly in China, but they're starting to be explored over here as well, do seem to be of benefit. And these are as they sound. They use them in schools in China now, which are literally visual focus exercises. Your mental focus, that is your ability to focus on things cognitively, follows your visual focus. And of course your stress will anchor your-- essentially put you in a soda straw view of the world. So yes, there are non medication-based treatments. By medication I'm assuming you mean prescription medication. There are of course supplement-based medications that will increase dopamine mainly L-tyrosine. Again, this is something to think carefully about before you start tampering with your dopamine system. But it is the-- L-tyrosine is the precursor to dopamine. So it will raise your dopamine levels. But I believe, and you'll hear me say this as many times as necessary, that one should-- if you can rely on behavioral tools first, then of course, sleep and nutritionists are prerequisite. Again, for all mental health, physical health performance, you simply can't neglect those. And then and only then if all of that isn't working to rely on supplement-based tools or on prescription medication. So it's clear that Vyvanse, Adderall, Ritalin, et cetera work for ADHD, but some people choose to rely on more subtle forms of pharmacologic manipulation like L-tyrosine. And this focusing exercise essentially consists of spending 1 to 3 minutes trying to maintain visual focus. And yes, you are allowed to blink. I don't know why we tend to stare at something we don't blink. But don't let your eyes dry out. And that can increase your ability to focus cognitively. And it works. And keep in mind that focusing always involves a refocusing. We covered a beautiful data set, not collected by my lab but by Wendy Suzuki's Lab at NYU, that at roughly 10-minute, it's actually 13-minute a day meditation of the sort, where you just focus on your breathing, has been shown to improve focus significantly. Why don't we hear about this more? Well she's now Dean of Arts and Sciences at NYU and all the students are hearing about it. Hopefully, they're doing it. But it takes a little bit of discipline for some reason 10-minute a day type meditation is something that very few people follow consistently. But if you're looking for non medication-based treatments for ADHD, or you're somebody who just struggles with focus, the focusing exercise or the meditation, I just subscribed it can be very useful, so say the data. Yeah, thanks for bringing up space-time bridging. Are people familiar with what space-time bridging is? I haven't talked a lot about it. OK, this is-- thanks for bringing that up. We actually have an episode on meditation coming up soon where I cover it. And I talked about it long ago and then I kind of abandoned it because well, we wanted more data and it's a pretty interesting technique. If you think about the nervous system and vision in particular, but if you're not a sighted person or you're low vision, or no vision, you could do this with your hearing. But I'm going to assume most people here are sighted. If not just translate this to the auditory system. You have this incredible ability to close your eyes and focus, for instance, on-- people talk about the third eye center, focusing right behind your forehead. Do you know why people do that when they meditate? The reason is that you actually have no sensation in your brain. It's the one place to focus your attention for which you abandon sensation. If I think about any portion of my body or my breathing, either I'm going to sense what's happening. I'm going to perceive my inner landscape, so-called interior reception, or my outer. If I look out into the world, it's external perception. When you focus your attention with your eyes closed, you do have to close your eyes just behind your forehead. You are focusing on your thinking Sort of obvious, but I don't-- at least to me it never been stated that clearly. Again, one of the problems with some of the more traditional practices but also the problem with science, is that there's a shrouding of everything in very complex language, which sucks. Why is it suck? Because it's a separator. You eliminate the number of people that can be brought to potentially useful practices. And I don't like it when people, including myself, overuse mechanism and descriptions of fancy phrases to mask basic principles, so simplest language I think it tends to unify people around the practices. So when you focus on this so-called third eye center, or a spot right behind your forehead or on your breath-- it's a little tricky with the breath, but when you focus on your frontal cortex, there's nothing to sense. Because there's no sensory neurons there. There's no touch. There's no pain. Nothing. That's why in these gory movies, you can take the skull off and-- while in neurosurgeries they're poking around in there, and the person's playing a violin. Like no anesthetic No anesthetic. Doesn't require anesthetic. There's no sensory neurons. You can't sense anything there. So space-time bridging involves-- it's essentially a meditation, but it's really a perceptual exercise. I think that's where we're going with this, is it starts by closing your eyes and focusing on that location for which there is no sensation. There's only thought. And then opening your eyes and focusing on a location maybe about the distance of your hand. And you focus also on your breathing. So you sort of imagine a kind of a tether between that. You can split your attention to these two locations. You're thinking about your body and you're thinking about a location outside of you. And then while continuing to think about your body, so-called intersection, focus on your breathing, you focus further out, and then further out, and then further out. And then ultimately, you know that little cartoon or meme where they're like, we're just a little blue dot floating in a big universe. And like it's supposed to make all your problems go away. It kind of works because what you've done is you've expanded your perception, and you go oh, yeah the stuff that's happening in here is really important when I'm focused on what's happening in here. But when I'm focused on what's going on and the vastness of all this, and we're just a little pale blue dot and all that, it changes your perception. Not just your visual perception obviously. Changing your visual perception changes your cognitive perception, which changes your emotional experience. So the space-time bridging is a perceptual exercise where you step from focusing internally to focusing externally at a short distance, then a further distance, further distance, further distance, and then trying to imagine yourself in this larger landscape. It sounds very mystical but it's actually very neurobiological. And it captures something really amazing. Why is the T in there-- the time? Space-time bridging, because this is space? But time is in there because when you focus in close, your slicing of time is finer. You notice the subtle fluctuations in your breathing and things that are happening up close. Whereas when you focus further out, your perception of time actually changes, which is why in panoramic vision we are calm. And when you think about, we're just a pale blue dot and we mostly only live to about 85 or maybe 100 years old, and then what's happening right now, my boss being a jerk, and all that doesn't really matter because the Earth is spinning and all that kind of stuff. Which is all true. And it's the stuff of philosophy and mindfulness. And I think it's beautiful. What you're really doing is you're changing your time perception by changing your space perception. So space-time bridging is very useful because most people get locked at one step, one of these stations, especially under conditions of stress. And people who have trouble focusing-- and I'm glad you brought this up in this context of ADHD, people have a hard time focusing whether or not they have ADHD or not, tend to skip back and forth between different space-time domains, as we call them in science. So this is a simple exercise that you can do. Focusing internally then stepping out externally, and then stepping back in. All the while paying attention to your inner landscape just simply by focusing on your breathing. It's a tool that we're still collecting data on in terms of its utility, but people are already using it. And I don't think of it as a meditation. I think of it as a perceptual exercise. Thanks for asking that. As a teenager what are five things"}
{"question": "What are some simple and effective mindfulness practices that a 15-year-old can incorporate into their daily life to manage stress and feel their best?", "doc_id": "TO0WUTq5zYI_3", "video_id": "TO0WUTq5zYI", "video_title": "LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman Question & Answer in Los Angeles, CA", "video_header": "As a Teenager, What Are 5 Things You Would Recommend to Physically Feel My Best?", "segment_idx": "3", "time_start": "11:57", "time_end": "14:36", "context": "you would recommend to physically feel my best? I'm a 15-year-old surfer who attends high school and plays soccer. It sounds like you're doing a lot of things, right? To physically feel your best. So I'm going to grasp at some context here that I'm not-- that's not within reach. I'm assuming if you are doing all these things you're hopefully doing a bunch of other things too. And they're going to be demands on you that you probably some of them you don't want to do, school and things like that, are going to have varying levels of joy and delight and demand of things you don't want to do. I don't want to default always to the simplest of tools. But I certainly think that even as a 15-year-old if you're not already getting lots and lots of sleep, that's going to be great. Tell your parents that I said you should get lots and lots of sleep. provided you're not sleeping through classes, I'm a professor after all. I couldn't tell you otherwise. I would say if I could travel back in time as a 15-year-old, I would encourage you to cultivate some sort of mindfulness practice. I know this sounds a little cliche, but having some awareness of your thinking about your thinking is good. But I'm actually not going to say sit down and meditate for 10 minutes a day, or do NSDR. I'm actually not going to tell you that I think given how plastic your brain is, how much it's changing at 15, I would encourage you-- and maybe you would set a timer for this, to actually develop just a really keen awareness of what stresses you out, what relaxes you, what delights, you et cetera. And just to simply develop an awareness of that, because those are your antennae. And I certainly had a meditation practice as a youth, mostly given to me, because I was a little haywire and I needed it. And it worked pretty well. But I think in retrospect, what I wish I had developed was more of a sense of how I navigated stress or things and things I enjoyed and things I didn't enjoy. And I would just encourage you to have a general awareness. Try and detect and learn about what raises your adrenaline, what raises your dopamine, what raises your serotonin, and then start thinking about tools. But, again the awareness is going to be very valuable and gosh, as a 15-year-old you are in this amazing blessed period of heightened neuroplasticity, should we all be so lucky. So enjoy it. Next question please."}
{"question": "What is the underlying neural mechanism that enables the eye movement aspect of EMDR to help process and resolve traumatic memories?", "doc_id": "TO0WUTq5zYI_4", "video_id": "TO0WUTq5zYI", "video_title": "LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman Question & Answer in Los Angeles, CA", "video_header": "Should We Wait to Feel the Rise of Adrenaline and the Fall of It Before Bailing From Cold Water?", "segment_idx": "4", "time_start": "14:42", "time_end": "24:02", "context": "Clarity on adrenaline regarding cold water. Should we wait to feel the rise of adrenaline, the \"get me out of here\" feeling and the fall of it before bailing? Yes, provided it doesn't kill you. I don't want to say cold water. It's hard to kill yourself with cold water, provide your head's above and you're breathing. But it's-- sorry, my podcast producer's always like, \"I can't help that.\" Anyway, it's a great tool. And different days it'll feel different. So for instance, doing any kind of adrenaline and deliberate cold exposure, or adrenaline increasing activity early in the day, you might find that you are more \"resilient\" than later. In other words, the wall like, I really don't want to do this. This is actually interesting for I think it extends beyond cold water. Let's say you really don't want to do something. Pay attention to the fact that maybe it's not the right thing to do. But assuming it's something that you know you should do but you don't want to do, you are already in the first wall of adrenaline. You don't experience it necessarily as heightened levels of stress. You might experience it as heightened levels of fatigue or a hard time shifting on that kind of activation state that's required to move through the thing. But I do encourage you to take advantage of that. And we have an episode coming out tomorrow actually that answers questions like, should you train if you're sick and what if you travelling. And there's context always. But I think that you do want to experience. If you want to get the most out of the cold water exposure and to be more specific the adrenaline, then you want to get to that point of I really want to get out of here, but I know I can stay in safely. But I really want to get out of here. And it's a little hard to explain, but there's just so much learning in those short moments about where your mind goes. And this sounds very kind of again, subjective and maybe a little wishy-washy. But you can realize great things about yourself in those moments. You can find insight in those moments. Also keep in mind that the degree of discomfort, not just physical but mental discomfort, is directly predictive of the pain to pleasure wave that you'll experience afterwards. The reason it feels so good when you get out of the ice bath and you're showered off-- I always do the warm shower after. I don't do this end on cold thing. I don't know, It just seems a little too painful. And then take a warm shower and then you feel great. And that's the surge of dopamine that we know based on a paper published in the European Journal of physiology lasts many hours, and it's a 100% to 200% increase in dopamine. It's not a subtle effect. And then people say, wait, is that dopamine going to crash my dopamine system? No, because it's a nice slow rise. In fact, I am actually not aware of many things besides love and delight that can create this long, slow arc of dopamine lasting many hours. Maybe you're aware of other things. If you are, let me know. But it turns out that long arc is a true anti depressant. And my colleague at Stanford, Dr. Anna Lembke who's the head of our Dual Diagnosis Addiction Clinic has talked about in her amazing book Dopamine Nation about patients of hers that have really helped themselves along and out of the more depressive phases of working through addiction and in just depression in general through directed cold water therapy. So I'm obviously a fanatic about it in the sense that it's a powerful relatively safe, if done properly. Safe, if done properly, way to modulate your internal dopamine. Hopefully, I answered your question. Next question please. Sorry, I caught it raised it went off the fall, as well. Yes, I think you should get out once you've accomplished something. Don't get out when you panic unless it's dangerous, sorry. How can you train your brain to feel more confident moments where you tend to feel intimidated? OK, these are hard question. Because context is tricky here, because I don't know what the context is. And confidence on short time scales, and then long time scales, so confidence in school, confidence in career, those are long arc things. Whereas confidence to be able to do something in the short term is different. But remember those action sequences that trigger the release of dopamine. I've mainly talked about the dark side of dopamine, but I hopefully also talked about the sort of upward spiral that dopamine can cause, mainly by thinking about delight and things that you really enjoy. That carries over. And I would say that you want to micro slice the demands of what's maybe got you back on your heels a bit. Actually a good friend of mine who's here tonight, I think also my friend Pat, he has a great way of conceptualizing this, which is for most all endeavors we either feel back on our heels, flat footed, or forward center of mass. Like we can really do something, we're flat footed, we're back on our heels. And sometimes getting from back on our heels, lets call that lack of confidence to just on two feet, and confident enough to move forward or at least stay in the game. That's going to require you could lean on different tools. I can't say which would be ideal for the circumstance you have in mind. But I do think that having a way to calm yourself will give you access to more internal resources. We know this. This was something I meant to bring up during the discussion about fear versus love, et cetera, trying to access delight and love. When we are in a state of fear or stress or anxiety, the rule set, the options available to us, and indeed our creativity, is greatly diminished. And this has to do with the way that the prefrontal cortex interacts with an area of the brain called the insula, which relates to our internal landscape. And there's this weird phenomenon, which is that normally, our brain-- our thinking brain and our rule setting brain can-- it leads the brain parts that control and pay attention to how we feel internally. And that's why for instance, if you feel a little nervous you can still do something. At some point you get stressed enough. And we know this from work by my colleague David Spiegel, it reverses. And these areas of the brain that are paying attention like how flushed my face is, or whether or not I'm sweating, or my breathing, actually start to shut down creative decision making. So I would say the way to have more confidence is to learn to control that stress and keep the part of your brain. The prefrontal cortex is that part that can come up with new rules that can be funny that can be creative. That keeps that brain part leading. The way to think about this is, the prefrontal cortex is sort of like the coach, and the rest of your brain are sort of like the players. And if you get too stressed, the players start to lead the game and the coach follows, and kind of drags them along. So I would encourage you to focus on real-time stress modulation, and to raise your stress threshold using the sorts of tools we talked about. And to register your wins. I didn't get into this in too much detail, but one of the amazing things about the dopamine system is that it's highly subject to your interpretation. If you tell yourself that a fail was a win, and you can see or conceptualize some way in which that's actually true, you get to tap into the dopamine system. You might think that's crazy. You can cheat your own brain. You can cheat your own neurochemistry. And indeed you can. You can change the time, space-time reference. And we see this with examples like Nelson Mandela or Viktor Frankl. You read their stories trapped in little cells, confined, imprisoned. And they come up with new ways to access the dopamine system by now not thinking about what they're not getting, but thinking about what they can control in their immediate experience. Many examples of this throughout literature and history. And the dopamine system is the life force system. I don't say that in any loose way. Dopamine is life force. It's the wish and the desire to continue. It's persistence. And so if you can think about what might seem like a failure and really spend some time thinking about not the potential wins on the outside, but how you can conceptualize that as a potential win internally, you really do get to achieve an internal chemical win. And that chemical win sets you up for more real wins, hopeful that make sense. It's incredible how contextualize the dopamine system is. But if it weren't, why would it matter if we're talking about money or mates or food or job or school? You don't get 50 reward systems and motivation systems. You get one, and that's the dopamine system. Next question please. What is the competing mechanism behind bilateral eye movement, EMDR, that helps resolve psychological trauma?"}
{"question": "What are some of the most promising combination therapies and interventions being explored in the realm of mental health and wellness, particularly in relation to trauma and stress resolution?", "doc_id": "TO0WUTq5zYI_5", "video_id": "TO0WUTq5zYI", "video_title": "LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman Question & Answer in Los Angeles, CA", "video_header": "What Is the Competing Mechanism Behind Bilateral Eye Movement (EMDR & Walking) That Helps Resolve Psychological Trauma?", "segment_idx": "5", "time_start": "24:10", "time_end": "28:05", "context": "The competing mechanism. Well, let me try and answer as best I can. I'm not sure I understand the full extent of the question. But let me-- EMDR, moving your eyes from side to side, right? And then recounting a trauma is a very common and actually one of the four approved treatments that are behavioral for trauma. So it's taken seriously in the psychiatric and psychological community for good reason. It tends to work best for single event traumas as opposed to entire childhoods. No joke there. Some people have their entire childhood that was traumatic. Other people they experience a single event trauma or repeated periods of the same or similar type of trauma. Eye movements from side to side have been shown in a number of studies to very potently reduce the activity of a brain structure called the amygdala, which most people are familiar with, because of the character from the Star Wars movie, Amygdala. There's a neuroscientist somewhere on that team. It is indeed a threat detection center and when you move through space, not outer space, but when you walk like this your eyes actually generate these subtle side to side shifts, unless you're focusing on a specific target. And my lab and other laboratories have found that leads to a very potent quieting of the threat detection system. And then EMDR is essentially a process of pairing that calmer state with no threat detection system activated with the recount of something that normally would be quite triggering. So you've heard of Pavlovian conditioning, like a bell rings and the animal gets fed and animal salivate eventually, just the bell will evoke the salivation. You're doing the reverse of that. It's called behavioral desensitization. It has an underlying mechanism, et cetera. But the idea is to pair a calm state with recount of something. It has been shown to be successful. There are people who think that the side to side eye movements and the recount of trauma may actually be invoking some form of hypnosis. My colleague David Spiegel's an expert in clinical hypnosis, has appeared on my podcasts, Rituals podcasts and a few other podcasts. And talks about, this it is not stage hypnosis, it's clinical hypnosis. So there may be something going on there. EMDR-- again, some people get great relief from it. Other people don't. What's kind of nice is that this eye movements from side to side or simply taking a walk as long as you're not looking at your phone and not allowing your eyes to move from side to side, is a very good way to shut down the fear and stress system. So taking a walk I think is relaxing for obvious reasons. And there are data showing that part of the reason why animals scratch at the door and want to go for a walk may not actually be the exercise. There's kind of an anxiety and then an anxiety relief that occurs. Of course, they have to go to the bathroom too. One of Costello's great joys in life was just peeing on everything outdoors, thankfully. So the psychological trauma rewiring, unfortunately there haven't been a lot of brain imaging studies looking at this long term of how well EMDR works. What I think is going to happen in the next few years by the way, is it is not going to be a discussion around, should you do EMDR, should you do transcranial magnetic stimulation, should you do behavioral therapy? It's going to be combination therapies. Combination therapies, including pharmacologic manipulations to essentially give a boost to the systems that encourage neuroplasticity, like dopamine and serotonin and adrenaline. And then also then perform EMDR. And if you want to talk about what's happening in the landscape of clinical trials on some of the psychedelics, I'm happy to talk about it. They're still illegal, but they are being used in clinical trials. And very interesting stuff is happening there. OK, next question please. What new research or interventions are you most excited about in the realm of health and wellness?"}
{"question": "What are some non-invasive and easily accessible interventions that can help modulate and improve overall health and wellness, and why are they not more widely adopted by the general public?", "doc_id": "TO0WUTq5zYI_6", "video_id": "TO0WUTq5zYI", "video_title": "LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman Question & Answer in Los Angeles, CA", "video_header": "What New Research or Interventions Are You Most Excited About in the Health & Wellness Realm?", "segment_idx": "6", "time_start": "28:12", "time_end": "37:24", "context": "So what I think is going to be very interesting in the next few years really reflects my memory obsession that you've seen a little bit of tonight. But the thing that I think is going to be most useful-- and I've seen this in science before and I think we're going to see it in health and wellness. It's that there are all these tools and all these people, and he's saying this and she's saying that. But what, we're going to start paying attention to is, what are the common themes? And a broader and more important theme is going to be one of modulation versus mediation. What do I mean? Well, if someone were to pull a fire alarm right now, and please don't, that will shift our attention and make it hard to focus on what I'm saying. And knowing me I'd probably just stay up here talking. Do we think that fire alarms mediate attention? No, they modulate it. If it were very cold in this room like it was when we first got here tonight, or arctic cold-- hopefully it's warmed up a bit. It has and I'm so sorry. So sorry. Yeah, I attempted to-- yeah. I almost thought maybe we all just do a bunch of breathing to heat up like adrenaline release. But these days getting groups of people to all breathe on each other is not exactly a-- I can see that might go the wrong way in terms of what people interpret. So the idea here is that certain things directly mediate something. Like a physiological side directly calms you down quickly. It mediates the calming response. Getting good sleep makes you less easily triggered. It modulates stress. But is sleeping directly mediating stress control? No, and I think this is really important. And this brings up the topic of the gut-brain axis. The gut is rich with these little bugs, bacteria trillions of them, which is an eerie thought to me. But also the surface of your skin, the surface of your eyes, you have a skin microbiome, a nasal microbiome. Every mucosal lining has a microbiome. In fact, think about this. This is a crazy but worthwhile tangent. Have you ever bitten the inside of your mouth? It sucks, right? And you get cut and it hurts. But guess what, the inside of your mouth heals without a scar. Think about that. Weird, right? You cut anywhere else on your body, and depending on how well you heal, and your age and your immune status, you get a scar. Your mouth is filled with bacteria and it's open to the world, but the gut microbiome, provided it's healthy, provides an incredible ability to heal quickly. And I'm not somebody who's done a lot of acupuncture. I went a few times. And now there's interesting science happening on acupuncture. But what's the first thing they do when you walk in there? Let me see your tongue. And then they go oh, yeah. And they have this cool intuition that's not based on Western mechanistic science. It's more of an intuition based on millions, if not billions of data points that have been put into these charts. It's pretty cool. And what they are looking at, I believe and from what my colleagues who work on microbiome tell me is, they can look at the pallor of your tongue, in particular in the back and get a sense of whether or not the microbiome there is of the appropriate stuff. But they don't go, oh, lactobacillus. Remember this all end to illness, right? But then, Oh you're just biotic. Instead they get a sense. Now, parents of small babies learn to detect all sorts of things coming out of essentially every orifice of the child as a readout of health because the child doesn't have language. And a dog owners unfortunately you want to do this too, for better or for worse. Probably for better, right? So we have this intuition about gut health. But gut health would be another example, where it's very clear now that fiber can be helpful but it's mostly consuming these fermented foods that have been used for ages. But low sugar fermented foods of the natto, kimchi, sauerkraut, kombucha, et cetera, all these things depending on which culture you're in, they come in different forms. Certain yogurts, et cetera, that allow the gut to be healthy. And it modulates a huge number of systems. So I don't think that you're going to cure depression by adjusting your gut microbiome. But if your gut microbiota are not well, and you improve that, it will indeed shift the neurotransmitter systems of your brain and give you a elevated mood. That shouldn't come as a surprise anymore. But I think that the whole world thinks like, gosh it must be the serotonin in the gut. No, it's actually not serotonin gut. It's that the gut microbiota create chemicals that actually become serotonin in the brain, or become dopamine in the brain. And so I think that the gut microbiome, I would put in the same category, although not quite as important. I would put it in the category of like sleep. It modulates a huge number of other processes. It doesn't mediate them. , So sunlight, sleep, healthy gut microbiome, exercise, good nutrition, social connection, these things all create this general milieu or environment of health. I would like to see more distinction between modulating and mediating effects and tools out there, because I also see a lot of unnecessary argument. People are like, there's no example that improving your gut microbiome cures depression. Of course there's not. But there are really good examples. If your gut microbiome is off that improving it can improve mood, which depending on where you are on that spectrum of depression can really relieve things. So I think that the future of health, we hear so much about personalized medicine and matched to your genome. But we don't even have the basic. Most people don't even have the basics right. And if you watch or listen to the podcast long enough, hopefully certain themes start to repeat themselves. But a key theme that you learn in science, you teach your students, does it modulate or does it mediate it? You need to be careful with your language there. And there's great information, or as we say, interpretation power there. If you understand the difference then I think we can go a long way by making that distinction modulating versus mediating. There are probably other things that modulate health that I'm overlooking now just because of the flow that I'm in. The CoolMitt. Yeah, the CoolMitt. Palmer cooling. OK, I promised to talk about Palmer cooling. Well, I'll do it now. Palmer cooling they changed the Q&A format. What can I say, this is like teaching in the classroom. All right, very briefly. The Palmer cooling, which is essentially placing-- you can cool the core of the body most quickly by placing cold objects on the hands, the bottoms of the feet, or on the top of the face, because of the arrangement of vasculature. Normally, you've got this arteries, capillaries, veins things, but at those locations in the body, you skip the capillaries and you can basically-- you're not really passing cooling the body, but you're cooling off the core of the body more quickly. And, if you do that in between sets of exercise or during a run or cycling you can dramatically increase your ability to continue. I actually use the CoolMitt for cognitive work. But you don't need a CoolMitt. Sorry, guys. You can just get a thing of ice water or just very cold water. And I know it sounds trivially easy, but you're actually just cooling your core by putting your hands or even one hand on a relatively cold thing of water or ice. But not so cold that it constricts the vasculature there. This is the incredible work of my colleague at Stanford Dr. Craig Heller. Why wouldn't more people do this if you can double the amount of endurance? Believe it or not. Or double the number of sets of exercise you can do or feel more alert and do more cognitive work. Why wouldn't more people do it? Because people just don't do it. And it sounds crazy. It really sounds crazy, but it's a real thing. And I wish more people would do it. The athletes at Stanford do it. People in the military do it. So people who know and they use it, enjoy it. It's just it's almost like seems to off target from what you're trying to accomplish. I don't know, for some reason, people are finally onboard breathing like in a specific way as a useful tool. A few years ago no one was into that. I mean, just think of how far we've come. It's incredible. People are talking about psychedelics, meditation, breathing. I think the pandemic for all its pains and, you know, what a challenging period for all sorts of reasons, did wake people up to the idea that you have to take control over your health, because there's no magic fairy coming to do it for you. And with all due respect there's no government agency that's going to drop off the kit at your front door of like, here's how you take good care of yourself. So it just not going to happen. And it wouldn't happen under any circumstances. So it's a personal responsibility issue."}
{"question": "What role do supportive social networks play in navigating the challenges of scientific research and staying motivated?", "doc_id": "TO0WUTq5zYI_7", "video_id": "TO0WUTq5zYI", "video_title": "LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman Question & Answer in Los Angeles, CA", "video_header": "What Lessons From Skateboarding Have You Learned That Can Be Applied to Neuroscience?", "segment_idx": "7", "time_start": "37:30", "time_end": "39:01", "context": "All right. What lessons from skateboarding? The failure part. The failure, failure, or failure. I mean, for me skateboarding-- never was a good skateboarder. I still have close friends in that community and our photographer and a guy who does all the visuals and the other guys do the visuals for our podcast, Mike Blabac, Chris, and Martin, all of that community. I think that for me that community was really-- as Mike will sometimes say, skateboarders hate everything, meaning they have a very high threshold for what they consider acceptable. It's not just what you do. It's how you do it. Super important. And I think in neuroscience, there are a lot of-- there's a lot of stuff. In science in general, there are so many papers and there are so many experiments. How do you navigate that landscape? I think it helped me develop a sense of taste. But the taste that I'm referring to is not necessarily a taste of which science is cool or not cool. That too, but it came through a few times tonight when I was talking about my mentors. I picked back then skateboarding because I really liked the people. And also you didn't need your parents to go to a game. And so that worked for me. And you could kind of make your own schedule. And I do think it's very important to the extent that you can, in science and in everything, to surround yourself with the kinds of people that you just really enjoy being around. And so to me, the podcast, running a lab, feels a lot like skateboarding. It's the same energy. It's the same neurochemical systems firing, so that's-- yeah, that one. Next? Favorite Feynman. Oh, I know that's inappropriate."}
{"question": "What inspired Richard Feynman's approach to physics, which focused on general principles and principles of observation rather than specific details?", "doc_id": "TO0WUTq5zYI_8", "video_id": "TO0WUTq5zYI", "video_title": "LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman Question & Answer in Los Angeles, CA", "video_header": "Favorite Feynman Story", "segment_idx": "8", "time_start": "39:08", "time_end": "42:07", "context": "I do have a Feynman story, but it's inappropriate. Darn it. Damn. Maybe some time. This is why I don't drink. Good decision making. Well, I read all of Feynman's books. So I had the pleasure I never met him. He was dead before I was born. But my dad did. And he had good Feynman stories and they were inappropriate. So the cool thing about Feynman was that he didn't really care if people understood the specifics of what he was talking about. He just wanted people to get turned on to how amazing physics was. And he loved general principles. And one of the things-- the example that sometimes given out. I don't know how many of you're familiar with the Feynman books. But surely, you're joking Mr Feynman or what do you care what other people think, all of that stuff it's wonderful. He picked locks. When he worked at Los Alamos Labs, they were working on the bomb. And he basically-- well, there and elsewhere. And every morning the offices used to come in and he would spread all the top secret papers out on the floor. He would break into the safes at night. And then they were perplexed who could do this. And he liked safe cracking. Literally like national security secrets just for fun, prankster. He also bongo drummed naked on the roof of Caltech. And he did most of his writing of theorems in strip clubs, in fact. Learnt to draw late in life, was really into flotation tanks, and very curious about but never did psychedelics. That's as I understand. But one of the cool Feynman factoids is that when he was a kid, he talks about when he was a child that his dad used to take him birdwatching. And he'd say, oh, well that's a whatever scrub jay and that's whatever thrush and that's the-- and his dad said, no don't cloud your mind with naming and taxonomy. That's not meaningful. Because then what if it's different? The pigmy thrush or the lesser or this or that. The more important thing is to start to identify principles of why certain birds behave one way and certain birds behave another. And to start finding the commonalities and the regularities. And that's a theme that I obviously tonight have tried to impose. And it's actually something that I can't do in podcasts, necessarily because I can't thread across 40 episodes. Or something like that in the same way that I could in an evening like this. So that's an appropriate Feynman story. Also he just seemed like a delightful guy. And he's kind of cool. He's a little bit street, he had the thick accent. He was from Far Rockaway, but he didn't really care much what people thought, or he did and he pretended he didn't. Care for when people tell you they don't care what people think. I think he did to the extent that it still allowed him to get the message out there. OK, next question please. My horse."}
{"question": "What are some strategies that can help regulate the autonomic nervous system and promote calmness and relaxation in both humans and animals?", "doc_id": "TO0WUTq5zYI_9", "video_id": "TO0WUTq5zYI", "video_title": "LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman Question & Answer in Los Angeles, CA", "video_header": "Do You Suppose This Physiological Stress Regulator Transcends Species?", "segment_idx": "9", "time_start": "42:13", "time_end": "47:16", "context": "Wow. I love this. I delight in all things animals, but especially horses, because my high school girlfriend had a horse. And they do that thing where people go, oh you know, horses can detect how-- they know more about you than you know. And then I get onto the horse, and the horse like this this and this. And it's like a litmus test. Having a girlfriend with a horse was very intimidating for me actually. I felt like I had to compete with the horse. She spent all this time with the horse, it's very large. Anyway, eventually I broke the horse. OK, my horse does the double inhale, long exhale often. He's a bit of a stressed guy. Warm blood? Yeah, warm blood. I used to work at the barn. I used to shovel manure and work at the barn. She brought her horse to college. . I actually followed her off to college I never would have gone to college if she hadn't gone to college. And the horses are interesting animals. They do tell you a lot. The horse does the double inhale, long exhale often. He's a bit of a stress guy. Do you suppose this physiological stress regulator transcends species? Absolutely. In fact, I mentioned warm blood. I have a colleague at Stanford and she's amazing. Her name is Sue McConnell and she is an expert in dog genetics, so you can imagine I'm always asking her questions. And we talk about dogs and we talk about horses because she also-- I thinks she raises warm bloods. And you hear about hot bloods and warm bloods. And also, if you have any familiarity with dogs, there are dogs like Costello, or like a nuclear bomb could go off and Costello might open an eye. That's the bulldog, economy of effort. They're not going to get activated unless there's a reason to do it. They are very, as we call it, parasympathetic dominant. That seesaw of autonomic arousal is just really relaxed. Getting them into action is more of an effort. There are other animals like the whippet or the Italian greyhound. Like they're always cold, that are very sympathetic dominant. And then of course, within a breed or within a species there's a range. And humans also, are within a range. I think anyone who's had children will tell you he or she has been like this since birth. Calm, easygoing, or like really easily stressed. I think that seesaw, we didn't get into tonight too much. But there's a concept with the autonomic regulation of a hinge. So don't think so much about being really stressed out or really relaxed. But certain animals, the hinge is tighten so that the seesaw just kind of tilts mellow like Costello. A bulldog almost seems like a different animal than a whippet. They're so very different. And within the category of horses-- and I'm not an expert in horse genetics, but they are selected for not just for their physical attributes, but for their psychological or temperament attributes. And you see this in dogs too. In fact, the reason I picked Costello, and Elvis can verify the stories, I read-- I wanted a dog for so many years. And I went there and there were all these puppies. And I was like I heard you need to take them in the other room one by one. And then if it barks for its siblings, you're like, oh it's a healthy puppy. So I walk in and all the dogs are running around like crazy. It was right around Christmas time, right Elvis? And they're running around and then there's one in the back. And he's taking advantage of the fact that all the other ones are running. He's just eating out of all of their bowls. And I was like, I want that one. So I took that chubby little bastard in the next room and I thought, OK, he's going to bark for his siblings. And he lay down and he took a nap. And I was like, this one. I want this one. Why did I want that one? Well, this completes the principle which is, I wanted a dog like that because I'm not like that. And I was very interested in a dog I could take care of, but also a dog that would help regulate my nervous system. And so for me having a dog like that as opposed to a whippet or something that was going constantly around is a very calming effect. And to this day memory of his snoring still puts me to sleep. So I think that your horse probably has-- it kind of idles a little bit higher. Think about the rpm. You know, revs a little bit higher at a given speed-- more rpm at a given speed. That's the way I think about the autonomic system. How do you reset that? Well, this is why a lot of exercise is good, right? And certainly my girlfriend's horse was crazy. It was gelded late. And it was crazy. I almost said nuts but that's like a bad pun so it was not nuts but it was crazy. It was gelded late. Next question. Is there any science behind staying motivated or developing"}
{"question": "What are some practical tools or strategies that can help individuals sustain motivation and discipline over an extended period, rather than relying on short-term adrenaline or negative emotions?", "doc_id": "TO0WUTq5zYI_10", "video_id": "TO0WUTq5zYI", "video_title": "LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman Question & Answer in Los Angeles, CA", "video_header": "Is There Any Science Behind Staying Motivated or Developing Discipline?", "segment_idx": "10", "time_start": "47:24", "time_end": "50:43", "context": "discipline? Oh, so this represents the higher tier of where I think things are going to go in the next few years, where we're going to start seeing this convergence of psychology and biology, where we can get to these harder concepts. I like to think that we can stay motivated through a simple process that now will make sense to you. Because the last thing I covered was toggling back and forth between our ability to be gritty and linen, kind of in friction, maybe even a little anger, fear, competitiveness, et cetera. That kind of grinding in. But that the more sustaining fuel, the sort of hybrid version, a hybrid fuel model would be one in which you can access that. But that's a depletable and not so renewable resource without a lot of rest. Meaning, working hard out of anger, determination, and kind of grit will work, but when you are depleted you have to stop for a long while. Whereas if you can access this delight system, which is really one of dopamine and serotonin, both. In other words, and I want to think of a different way to put this, but to try and think about what sorts of things and tools allow you to be and feel most loving, I know it sounds weak. But it's anything but weak to be most loving in the verb sense of the word toward what you're doing. I actually used to use this trick in college when I'd encounter a topic I hated. I would tell myself I'm really-- I'm just going to fall in love with this by trying to find the gems within it. Sometimes it worked. Sometimes it didn't. But the wish to do it that way as opposed to OK, I'm just going to grind this out, at least for me at the time was a powerful tool. So motivation and-- discipline is a tricky one. That's sort of the just do it thing. You need tools to modulate your stress and to get your sleep-- do all the basic things right. Set the right context for you to be in your best chance of being disciplined. And that itself is its own form of discipline. But in terms of continual motivation you're not going to manage to go against the grain for very long. People have managed to go against challenge for a very long time-- for a very long times. In fact, I was reading recently about the psychology of people who've been kidnapped. And they have this odd trick that they used. Have you heard about this is sort of like Stockholm syndrome? But they actually convinced themselves to fall in love with their captors. And then they come up with new ways to escape them, which is kind of cool. So there's something about mentally feeling like you're trying to go from back on your heels to flat footed. That's very energetically costly. So again, these systems are very susceptible to what we call context or top down regulation. Hopefully that helps. I know it's a little bit abstract. I wish I could give you a 1-minute exercise or make you motivated. But we do talk about tools to get adrenaline going and things like that. But spend some time thinking about what would allow you to sustain effort through positive feelings. It's not a light concept at all. Next question please. What would be your biggest piece of advice"}
{"question": "What are some key strategies for developing an awareness of one's passions and interests, and for identifying the energy or attraction that drives personal growth and success?", "doc_id": "TO0WUTq5zYI_11", "video_id": "TO0WUTq5zYI", "video_title": "LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman Question & Answer in Los Angeles, CA", "video_header": "What Would Be Your Biggest Piece of Advice for Achieving One's Dreams?", "segment_idx": "11", "time_start": "50:50", "time_end": "57:04", "context": "for achieving one's dreams? Boy! That's a tough one. Again, this is going to be a little abstract. I'm a believer in this idea kind of a seed message. Robert Greene has talked a lot about this, that we can all kind of think back to a event or stage of our life. Typically it's before puberty for other reasons that are kind of interesting. But where we delight in something. So for me it was fish. And obviously now I don't need to work on fish. It wasn't about the fish. I hope that came through. I mean aquaria are really cool, but it's not about the fish. It was something about the way they moved. It was something about the way that it tickled my excitement. I used to get dropped off at this little pet shop in California Avenue called Monette's Pet Shop. And my mom used it as childcare. She would drop me off there and I had this book and I would log all the tropical fish, and which ones could be with which ones, and then I would-- I was obsessed. But for me it was something about organizing and being able to make reliable predictions. It was about parsimony. It was about principles as opposed to-- and the colors delighted me and all that kind of stuff. The equipment delighted me, but then I hit puberty. And then it was something else. And then I went to college and it was something else. And I got a girlfriend and it was something else. So it changes over time. But this is why I recommend to that young 15-year-old person that they learn to tap into that sense of like Oh, this is cool. Like this feels cool. I know not everyone else thinks it's cool. Maybe they do. Like this feels good. I actually have a somatic experience of this. I'm not a very semantically oriented person. I'm more up here. But I actually know if I'm on to something, if this left arm just kind of starts fidgeting, it's like I want to move or like some people-- you can start to identify ways in which you suddenly have this positive energy. It's not a fear energy. It's almost like a magnetism to things. And just don't be confused or misdirected in thinking that it's that thing. It's that energy or that attraction to something that feels right that is your-- I wish we had these divining rod to find water. That's your tool. It's like antennae, you want to grow your antennae. So how do you follow your dreams? Well, I never thought I'd do a podcast. I never thought I'd become a neuroscientist. You have to be willing of course, to take risks and to iterate quickly, but not so quickly that you fail out of the game, et cetera, if you do get back in, et cetera. But it's really about developing an awareness. Now, the key thing is you're not going to find this by going up a mountain and sitting there or waiting for your passion to just kind of rock it in, or piano fall onto your head. It's not going to happen that way. You have to interact with the sensory world and different kinds of people. And you have to be a little bit of a adventurer in a safe way, of course. An adventure and learn to recognize the signals. And some people are very in tune with this. There's an amazing podcast with Rick Rubin recently on Joe Rogan's Podcast where he talks about the creative processes. Kind of this-- it seems like whatever's going on in that beard of his just connects to the world. And he can just like-- there, that's where you need to go and that's-- But that's part of the magic, is you don't really know. And because it's all energetic-- it's all energetic. And when I say energetic, I don't mean in the mystical sense. I mean you have to learn to sense those fluctuations in energy. Some people can sense them very easily because they're very mellow. And if something gets them really excited they notice as a big delta, as we say in science, big change. Other people they ride kind of high all the time. And so everything is exciting to them, and they miss a lot of the subtle fluctuations in what's really special and right for them. In fact, mania is characterized by hyper elevated levels of dopamine and everything is a good idea. And depression is the opposite. Nothing is a good idea. Nothing's going to work. And those are the extremes. And those are rough conditions obviously. But for most people, it's about learning to detect those subtle fluctuations. And every time-- every single time you find somebody who is exceptional at their craft and doing well in life-- there are a lot of people who are exceptional at their craft, but not necessarily doing well on the whole. Those people have a kind of intuition about what feels good to them. This year's Nobel Prize winner in chemistry is my colleague, Carolyn Bertozzi. And all I know of her, except the fact that she's an amazing chemist, is they did this interview with her. And she said that when everyone would go out in college she was finding excuses to stay home and read organic chemistry. Now, that to me sounds like a bad night. But for her it was pure delight. And she's wired for that. And I think her work is going to be vitally important and transformative for humanity. I really do. So how do you succeed in chasing your dreams? You succeed in identifying what they are. But you don't know at the outset. You want to find the energy to find the right path and continually course correct when you will undoubtedly be off your path. That's essentially what I've done. I still look for the feeling of delighting in Costello or the cuttlefish. That's what I'm looking for. It's not a template I have to match, but that's my like, oh, yeah I know what that feels like. It's like a texture. It's like if you think about a bunch of different textures of sandpaper, it's like this one that just feels really good. And so you're comparing everything to that, because the system that involves all these chemicals, you'll find it if you learn to pay attention to it. But you won't find it sitting, staring at your belly button or going up a mountain. You have to be in sensory experience in order to find it. Reflection is good but you need to get into action. Wow. All right well."}
{"question": "What are the potential benefits and risks of using psilocybin for treating depression and PTSD, and how does the concept of \"letting go\" play a role in this process?", "doc_id": "TO0WUTq5zYI_12", "video_id": "TO0WUTq5zYI", "video_title": "LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman Question & Answer in Los Angeles, CA", "video_header": "What's Your Opinion on Psilocybin?", "segment_idx": "12", "time_start": "57:11", "time_end": "1:01:01", "context": "OK, so psilocybin. Opinion of the psychedelics. Generally, we just had an episode with my colleague Nolan Williams, who's a triple board certified neurologist psychiatrist. It's a fun thing about working at Stanford. It's also very humbling because you're like, whoa who are these people? They have three board certifications. The psilocybin-- first of all, not for everybody. People with psychosis, it is still illegal decriminalized in certain places. So obviously the cautionary notes people who have drug addiction issues or other kinds of addiction issues need to be thoughtful about diving into a neurochemical landscape like that. But it does appear that the clinical trials on one macro dose. This is what's interesting to me. A lot of people talk about micro-dosing psilocybin, but the data at least according to Matthew Johnson, who is also on the podcast, the data for micro-dosing are not really there, frankly. The data on single session macro dose, the sort of heroic doses that have been talked about in the psychonaut community for a depression and to some extent PTSD, and for eating disorders and sort of end of life preparation are quite encouraging. In fact, the current data suggests that about 2/3 of people achieve lasting relief from one session. Now, keep in mind those are guided sessions with physicians in the room, et cetera. I do think there's a potential hazard of all psychedelics, which is they alter-- this includes MDMA or especially MDMA, they alter the chemical landscape in you, such that a lot of things can serve as attractors in that state. Meaning you can get really into the sound of music in an MDMA session, feel connected to that, and waste the opportunity for some more meaningful transformative rewiring. And I do think that's worth paying attention to. So that's the usefulness of having a therapeutic guide, as they can continually steer you back to what at least for you is the more meaningful work. But it's very encouraging. And Nolan Williams, who I trust, is again triple board certified M.D. Said that in the studies of lifetime perceived individual and societal risk, of all the compounds out there except for caffeine, psilocybin is at the bottom of the list. Whereas things like heroin, cocaine, alcohol, methamphetamine sit at the top of the list. Actually, alcohol quite high on that list at certain amounts of consumption. So I'm very excited about what's happening in the landscape of psilocybin, but I'm not so excited about the micro-dosing data. Very excited about the single heroic dose data. One interesting thing there perhaps, what seems to be the unifying feature of a successful psilocybo-- psilocybin, excuse me session, is that at some point the person feels as if it's like too much of a autonomic thing. It kind of get to this point and then they are encouraged to \"let go.\" And I'm fascinated by this concept of letting go, because I'm a neuroscientist. We don't know what that means, but it seems like being able to ride the wave of autonomic arousal from top to bottom. Seems to be very powerful for trauma and depression treatment. And this is interesting. A lot of people think that one of the major issues in humans nowadays is we're stressed about a lot of things. But we never actually get to go into the full stress response, and then let it relax again. And catharsis was big at one point. Scream therapy, Steve Jobs is going to scream therapies. That whether or not catharsis is healthy or not has been debated but the data are kind of pointing to the fact that it may be provided that the catharsis is not. Obviously someone damaging themselves for somebody else. So maybe we should all be screaming a lot more."}

Oh, interesting. I can go in hungry and get out with no desire to eat. I can only speculate. The sauna or any kind of deliberate heat exposure that's uncomfortable releases this molecule dynorphin. This is actually the same molecule that's released under conditions of alcohol withdrawal. It makes you feel agitated and not good. And then there's this rebound. The way it feels good is later, it causes this upregulation in the so-called mu opioid receptors. So the chemicals that you have, your so-called endogenous opioids, not the opioids that are related to the opioid crisis. But the ones that you naturally make are able to have a more robust effect after the sauna. Dynorphin is an appetite suppressant and for reasons related to kind of general discomfort in the body. So that's the only reason I can speculate. There are a number of other things that sauna does including massive increases in growth hormone provided you don't sauna too much. So if you do it once a week four 20-minute sessions spaced five minutes apart, you get these enormous increases in growth hormone. If you start doing it more often you get still significant, but smaller increases in growth hormone."}
