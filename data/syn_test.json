{"question": "What are some common tools and theories that can be used to understand and make sense of emotions, especially in the context of emotional development during infancy and puberty?", "doc_id": "hcuMLQVAgEg_2", "video_id": "hcuMLQVAgEg", "video_title": "The Science of Emotions & Relationships", "video_header": "Emotions: Subjective Yet Tractable", "segment_idx": "2", "time_start": "7:41", "time_end": "10:49", "context": "Emotions are a fascinating and vital aspect of our life experience. It's fair to say that emotions make up most of what we think of as our experience of life, even the things we do, our behaviors and the places we go, and the people we end up encountering in our life, all of that really funnels into our emotional perception of what those things mean, whether or not they made us happy or sad or depressed or lonely, or were all inspiring. Now one thing that is absolutely true is that everyone's perception of emotion is slightly different. Meaning, your idea of happy is very likely different than my idea of what a state of happiness is. And we know this also for color vision, for instance, even though the cells in your eye and my eye that perceive the color red are identical right down to the genes that they express, we can be certain based on experimental evidence, and what are called psychophysical studies, that your idea of the most intense red is going to be very different than my idea of the most intense red if we were given a selection of 10 different reds and asked which one is most intense, which one looks most red, and that seems crazy, you would think that something as simple as color would be universal, and yet it's not. And so we need to agree at the outset that emotions are complicated and yet they are tractable. They can be understood. And today we're going to talk about a lot of tools to understand what emotions are for you to understand what your emotional states mean and what they don't mean. And in doing that, that will allow you to place value on whether or not you should hold an emotional state as true or not true, whether or not it has meaning or it doesn't, as well as whether or not the emotions of others are important to you in a given context. We're going to talk a lot about development. In fact, we're going to center a lot of our discussion today around infancy and puberty. We're also going to talk about tools for enhancing one's emotional range and for navigating difficult emotional situations. I'm not a clinical psychologist, I'm not a therapist, but I do have some background in psychology. And today I'm going to be drawing from the psychology greats, not me, but from the greats of psychology who studied emotion, who studied emotional development, and linking that to the neuroscience of emotion. Because nowadays we understand a lot about the chemicals and the hormones and the neural circuits in the brain and body that underlie emotion. So while there's no one single universally true theory of emotion, at the intersection of many of the existing theories, there are really some ground truth. So today we're going to visit those ground truths. We're going to talk about the tools that emerge from them. And we're going to talk about some absolutely wild and wacky experiments that people are doing out there right now, that I don't necessarily recommend you do, of inhaling different types of hormones and trying to get attached more quickly. You're actually going to do some experiential stuff today if you like. There's some things that you can do in real time while listening to the podcast, in order to tap into some of the mechanisms that I'll be referring to. So today's going to be very interactive in a way that previous podcast episodes have not. If we want to understand emotions, we have to look at where emotions first develop."}

Now, it's such a vitally important mechanism because it dictates how well and what time you will want to fall asleep later in the day, so for those of you that are night owls and you insist that you're a night owl and you have the genetic polymorphism that makes you a night owl, you may very well have that genetic polymorphism, those genes that make you want to stay up late and wake up late, but chances are, about half of you that think that you're night owls are just not getting enough sunlight early in the day. So viewing light early in the day, ideally sunlight, is key for establishing healthy sleep-wake rhythms and for allowing you to fall asleep easily at night. Now, it's not gonna make sure that all that happens every single time, but it is the foundation of proper sleep and what we call circadian health, it governs metabolism and so many other things that are supposed to exist on a regular 24-hour cycle. Some of you, many of you, might be asking, \"What else can help set this rhythm?\" Well, it turns out that light is what we call the primary zeitgeber, the time giver, but other things can help establish this rhythm of cortisol followed by melatonin 12 to 16 hours later as well."}
{"question": "What are the potential effects of taking theanine with caffeine, particularly for individuals who experience vivid dreams, night terrors, or sleepwalking?", "doc_id": "iw97uvIge7c_13", "video_id": "iw97uvIge7c", "video_title": "Using Caffeine to Optimize Mental & Physical Performance | Huberman Lab Podcast 101", "video_header": "Theanine: Effects & Dosage", "segment_idx": "13", "time_start": "1:13:02", "time_end": "1:18:37", "context": "talked about the effects of theanine on sleep at that sleep tool kit that you can find as a free download. You don't even have to sign up for. Anything you just download it from hubermanlab.com. Go to the menu, go to a newsletter. You'll see the tool kit for sleep. You'll see that the so-called sleep stack that I use and recommend includes magnesium 3 and 8, something called apigenin and theanine, although that sleep stack is designed to be taken 30 to 60 minutes prior to sleep. And I make the point there, and I'll make it again here that ingesting theanine prior to sleep is not a good idea if you are somebody who tends to have very vivid dreams, night terrors, or night walk-- sleepwalking, excuse me, et cetera. In that case, eliminate theanine from the sleep stack.. . However, a number of people are using theanine, and products are using theanine to offset jitteriness from caffeine-containing products during the daytime, daytime consumption, that is. A couple of notes about theanine-- theanine is something that is present in green tea, right? It's now been created as a supplement. It's what's called a nonprotein amino acid. So while there are amino acids and proteins, there are, of course, amino acids and nonproteins. And theanine is one such nonprotein amino acid. Theanine tends to stimulate the so-called glutamate and glutamine pathway. It's actually very similar to glutamate and glutamine, and it has a lot of effects on a lot of different aspects of the nervous system. But the general effect of theanine is to compete for the receptors for certain neurotransmitters. And the neurotransmitters I'm referring to are all excitatory neurotransmitters, things like glutamate. And they govern a tremendous amount of our daily thinking and action and feeling, et cetera, because they're present at so many connections between neurons in the brain. Theanine competes for the receptors for glutamate and tends to reduce our overall levels of alertness. So really, when people take theanine along with caffeine, what they're doing is they're really taking a slight-- I don't want to call it depressant to the point where it misleads people and makes people think that it will make you depressed. The word is a little bit misleading. But it tends to reduce or blunt some of the more excitatory pro-alertness actions of neurons in the brain. So when you take it alongside caffeine, tends to, quote unquote, \"even things out a bit.\" I should mention that the dosages of theanine that are effective for offsetting the jitteriness of caffeine is 200 to 400 milligrams, and the studies that I was able to find showed that essentially up to 900 milligrams per day can be safe. But that's a very high dosage of theanine. In fact, so much so that it might increase sleepiness to the point where it wouldn't feel good. There are also some positive effects of daytime consumption of theanine that are independent of reducing the jitteriness of caffeine. For instance, there's a study demonstrating that 17 days of ingesting theanine at these 200 to 400 milligram dosage at one to three times per day can reduce depression and anxiety. There are also some good data out there showing that theanine can have positive effects on endothelial cells-- so blood vessels, capillaries, and so on-- and increase some of the function of blood vessels, allowing them to pass more blood through them and give them a little bit more elasticity, if you will. So theanine has certain pro-sleep effects if it's taken prior to sleep. It can enhance the quality, depth, and duration of sleep. Again, if you're a sleepwalker or somebody who has extremely vivid dreams from which you wake up in the middle of the night, probably best to leave out theanine or maybe reduce the dosage down to 100 milligrams. And if that's still too much, then eliminate it completely. But theanine can be terrific for enhancing quality, depth, and duration of sleep. It can also reduce the jitteriness associated with caffeine-containing beverages and foods. And it has certain antidepressant and pro-endothelial effects. That is, it can offset depression. It can offset anxiety, although those are minor effects, subtle effects. And it has been shown to improve endothelial cell. That is, vessel and capillary function and structure in ways that can be beneficial for both brain and body. Now one final point about theanine that's worth paying attention to is that the kinetics of theanine are such that you don't need to take theanine every time you ingest a caffeinated beverage. When we ingest caffeine, the peak effects of caffeine occur about 30 minutes after we drink it. And there, I'm assuming one takes it all at once. And this is a key point that we'll come back to later rather than sipping your coffee slowly over a couple of hours or an hour. If you drink all 200 or 300 milligrams of caffeine in your coffee or 600 milligrams of your coffee if you're getting one of those commercial coffees and you take theanine along with it, theanine will block some of the jitteriness and anxiety-inducing effects of caffeine that can occur for much longer than the effects that caffeine lasts. So the peak in theanine occurs about an hour after ingestion. I suppose if you want to get really fancy and really dial in the kinetics, you could ingest theanine about half hour before you ingest your caffeine. But I think that's getting a little bit excessive in terms of controlling your microenvironment, if you will. I think it would be perfectly fine to take a 100 to 200 milligram capsule of theanine along with your coffee or tea or so forth and just realize that if you drink more caffeine or you extend your caffeine intake over several hours that you don't necessarily have to take theanine repeated times throughout the day. I'd like to take a brief break and thank"}
{"question": "Is it possible to stimulate brown fat activation through cooling methods other than applying ice packs to the upper back, and if so, what alternative methods might be more effective?", "doc_id": "77CdVSpnUX4_28", "video_id": "77CdVSpnUX4", "video_title": "Dr. Craig Heller: Using Temperature for Performance, Brain & Body Health", "video_header": "Brown Fat Distribution & Activation In Humans", "segment_idx": "28", "time_start": "1:31:13", "time_end": "1:34:13", "context": "by the internet, I should say, I was taught by the internet that we have brown fat between our scapulae and our upper neck. Is that truly a source of brown enrichment for brown fat? - If you're a ground squirrel. - So this is all the drawings out there? Okay, so what I'm hearing you say is that brown fat is actually distributed in patch- - In humans, it's distributed along with other fat tissue. It's not as discreet. - So the reason I'm kind of shocked and amused and troubled by this is because there is a somewhat standard protocol in the performance, wellness, whatever world, whatever you want to call it, of putting ice packs on the upper back as a way to stimulate brown fat thermogenesis. I'm hearing some inhales of concern from the physiologist. So tell me why, it sounds like that's probably not the best way to stimulate brown fat activation. - Well, let's put it this way- You're not attacking anyone specifically, because the whole little believes this. - But it may not be totally facetiae or false. Think of what that's doing. If you put ice right there where your spinal cord is close to the surface, that's where you're going to hit the vertebral arteries. So you're essentially putting a cold source into the brain, to the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus is you're too cold. So it is going to turn on shivering and brown fat so. - Would there be a better site for sake of activating brown fat? Palmar cooling? - I can't say because the activation of brown fat is a sympathetic nervous system response. So any lowering of core temperature that will let the thermostat say you're too cold is going to turn on sympathetic. Now people will have perhaps different amounts of brown fat. So newborn have more brown fat than adults. - 'Cause the newborns can't shiver. Correct? - I don't know. - Okay. That's what I read. I don't know if that's true. I read that in what I believe to be credible sources. - Yeah, it could be. I just don't know, it depends on if it's really newborn, I can agree because you don't have all of the motor pathways connected up yet. That's something that occurs in early days of life and is probably one of the functions of REM sleep, which infants have a lot of. - Right. - Okay. But how to activate brown fat if you are consistently exposed to cold? So if you live in the Arctic and you go out jogging in the winter, maybe that will increase the amount of brown fat you have. If you live in the tropics, maybe you have less brown fat. I don't know. I don't know of any studies which have looked into that. - Okay. Ice headache."}
{"question": "How can we strike a balance between being receptive to and actively managing our internal body signals, particularly when it comes to emotional pain, to improve our overall well-being and navigate daily life effectively?", "doc_id": "PctD-ki8dCc_15", "video_id": "PctD-ki8dCc", "video_title": "Dr. David Spiegel: Using Hypnosis to Enhance Health & Performance", "video_header": "The Mind-Body Connection", "segment_idx": "15", "time_start": "1:28:01", "time_end": "1:31:30", "context": "We all like to think that, getting more in touch with our body, would be a great thing, learning to interocept, paying attention to our internal landscape, would be a great thing. But as we often discuss, when we're feeling lousy, then being really in touch with that lousy feeling, may or may not be a good thing, right? So, how should we think about mind-body? I can see examples in hypnosis, from your descriptions of hypnosis, where you want to unify the mind-body connection. Feel what you're thinking, think what you're feeling, et cetera. But I could also point to elements within the hypnotic process in which you are actively trying to uncouple those. - That's. - So, it sounds to me like, this whole mind-body thing is a bit more like a car. You can't say that 40 miles per hour is the optimal speed. It kind of depends on the road you're on and the turn you may or may not be taking. - Right. - How should we think about mind-body in terms of, navigating daily life? What do you think is the adaptive way, to conceptualize the mind-body? It's a big question. - It is. It's a very interesting one. I guess, I think that it's a matter or not of, absolute control but more control, that we need to think of our brain as a tool and our body's signals as tools as well, to help us understand what's going on in the world, what we need, what matters, what's important, what isn't, but also something that can be managed, not simply absorbed. And so, hypnosis I think is a kind of limiting case, where you can push it about as far as we can push it in terms of regulating pain. Pain is a good example of that. Obviously, you need to pay attention. If you just broke your ankle, you better pay attention to it and get help or you're having crushing substernal chest pain. You better do something about it. But our brain, is sort of programmed to treat all pain signals as if they were novel pain signals. If it's a sudden new problem that needs to be attended to. I teach people to think of the pain and categorize it, does the pain mean that if you put weight on this, you're going to re-injure your ankle for example, or does it simply mean that your body is healing and the pain is a sign that, gradually things are getting back to normal and so, you can modify the way you process pain, based on what your brain tells you the pain means. And that's true for emotional pain as well. And particularly where I think a strategy that really helps, is if you think of an interpersonal problem or a threat of something coming as an opportunity to do something to ameliorate the situation. So, it's not just it's happening to you, but something that you can influence and do something about. So, it's blending the receptive with the active response, that I think can make a difference. So, you try and process it in a way that gives you a deeper understanding of what's happening. You face it but you also say, this is an opportunity for me to do something about it. And the minute you realistically enha- and this doesn't mean, imagine away a heart attack. It means figure out how to rehabilitate from a heart attack or a broken leg or something like that in a way that you get as much control into the situation as you can. - I love it. Grief."}
{"question": "What are some natural and safe ways to increase dopamine levels in the brain and improve motivation, energy, and focus?", "doc_id": "T65RDBiB5Hs_10", "video_id": "T65RDBiB5Hs", "video_title": "Optimize & Control Your Brain Chemistry to Improve Health & Performance | Huberman Lab Podcast #80", "video_header": "Tool Kit 1: Increase Baseline Dopamine & Focus", "segment_idx": "10", "time_start": "1:01:45", "time_end": "1:08:50", "context": "You want to be more in pursuit of goals. And you want to have more energy and to be more focused. There are many ways to go about that. In fact, there's a near infinite cloud of opportunities, everything from prescription drugs to illicit drugs, which I certainly do not recommend, supplements, nutrition. You can listen to particular music. You can do all sorts of cognitive behavioral, nutritional supplementation tricks. Or you can just understand that what you're really after are increases in dopamine above baseline that you control and there are ways to control them that are quite potent and science tells us which tools are going to be the most potent and the most versatile for you. So I'm going to share those tools with you now with the caveat that each one of those tools could be its own entire podcast episode, and that we've done near entire episodes on each of these tools or small collections of these tools. So I'm going to cover these in somewhat superficial manner. We can provide links to previous episodes that relate to each of these tools in detail, but I'll give you enough detail about them that would allow you to incorporate them into your routine should you choose. Let's say you want to increase dopamine for sake of increasing motivation. The first thing to do is to understand what the natural behavioral tools are for increasing dopamine and to do those as consistently as possible. Again, these are tools that you'll want to do nearly every day, if not every day. And I know I'm sounding like a broken record on this one, but here again, we come to sunlight and I should say, not just the desire to, but really the need for viewing the maximum amount of sunlight that one can reasonably get given schedules and locations in the world, time of year, et cetera, in the early part of the day, within the first hour of waking, ideally, but certainly in the first three hours of your day, you are going to want to maximize sunlight exposure to your eyes. Never look at the sun or any other light so bright that it's painful to look at. And yes, of course blinking is fine, but no, take sunglasses off, go outside once the sun is out and get some natural light in your eyes. And if it's appropriate or I should say in a way that's appropriate, maximize the amount of sunlight exposure to your skin, but please don't get burned. Please do wear sunscreen if you're prone to getting burned. Typically early day sunlight is not going to burn you, at least not most people, unless you're extremely fair-skinned. So don't get burned. Do what you need to in order to protect yourself from burn. There's some emerging controversy about sunscreen and which ones are safe and which ones aren't safe. We have not done an episode on that yet, but I find it to be an important and interesting topic. Darya Rose, Dr. Darya Rose, I should say, has a podcast called The Darya Rose Podcast and did an episode all about sunscreens, which are safe, which are not safe, by interviewing an expert on that so I refer you to that podcast as it relates to sunscreen. But get some natural light exposure in your eyes. And if you wake up before the sun comes out, turn on as many bright lights inside as you can turn on reasonably given your electric bill, et cetera. Get a lot of bright sunlight exposure early in the day and get a lot of sunlight exposure to your skin in the early part of the day, in a way that doesn't burn you, meaning burn your skin or blind you, please. Please don't do anything that harms your vision like stare into a bright light, that's painful. What does that do? Well, it sets in motion a number of different biological cascades. Some are very fast. There are fast actions of sunlight that will trigger for instance, dopamine release from different parts of your brain and your endocrine system. And we now know that it increases levels of genes related to thyroid hormone and actually increases certain dopamine receptors. So there's a wonderful paper. We will provide a link to this paper that shows that sunlight exposure can actually increase the amount of so-called DRD4. This is a particular type of dopamine receptor, the dopamine receptor four. The genes for dopamine receptor four are actually under photic control. So if you get sunlight exposure to your eyes and it does have to be to your eyes in the early part of the day, you increase the amount of dopamine receptor that you have, which allows whatever circulating dopamine happens to be there to have a greater effect on motivation and I should say also on mood and feelings of being in pursuit and generally, in craving and pursuit of things in life. Now there's another way to increase the effect of whatever dopamine happens to be circulating in your brain and body. And this again, relates to increasing the number or the efficacy of the receptors for dopamine. Now here we're not talking about the dopamine receptor four, but a different category of dopamine receptors, the D2 and D3 receptors, which are expressed multiple places in your brain and body and bind dopamine, meaning dopamine parks in them like a parking spot and allows dopamine to generally increase the activity of the neurons and cells that express those dopamine receptors. How do you do that? Well, turns out that regular ingestion of caffeine at safe and appropriate levels, about a hundred to 250 milligrams is going to increase the number of D2 and D3 dopamine receptors. I talked a little bit about this on a previous episode. Again, we'll provide links to these studies, but this is an important finding, I believe, because this is not about the acute, the immediate effects of caffeine on alertness, although those occur, too. When you drink caffeine, it's going to increase your levels of adrenaline and so-called epinephrine, which will increase your energy levels. It's going to decrease levels of something called adenosine, which builds up while you're sleepy. It's going to make you feel less sleepy, more alert, more energetic. That's sort of obvious. But what's less obvious is that it's increasing the number and efficacy of dopamine receptors so that whatever dopamine happens to be around in your system is going to have more of a potent effect. So how much caffeine should you drink? That's going to vary from person to person. Some people are very sensitive to caffeine, others are not. I tend to be fairly insensitive to caffeine, 'cause I've been drinking it for a long period of time. But you know, after one or two cups of espresso or coffee, I feel like I've had enough. I tend to drink my caffeine early in the day, which is what I'm going to recommend that you do, not drinking caffeine past two and certainly not 4:00 PM, if you're on a typical schedule and you want to be able to sleep that night, even if you can fall asleep. Having too much caffeine in your system is not good because it disrupts the architecture of sleep. And now knowing about all the metabolic variability across the night, according to different stages of sleep, it should be even more obvious as to why disrupting the architecture of sleep would be bad for you. So limit that caffeine intake to early in the day and don't go ballistic. Certainly don't go ballistic in any case, but for most people anywhere from 100 to 400 milligrams of caffeine is going to have this effect. And this effect again is a slow accumulating effect by drinking caffeine consistently day-to-day. I get my caffeine mainly from Yerba Mate tea. I want to emphasize that it's probably a good idea to stay away from the smoked mates. There's some evidence those can be carcinogenic, but I brew my own Yerba Mate tea, or sometimes I'll drink coffee or espresso, or sometimes both frankly, as long as I'm hydrating enough and I'm getting enough salt, then I tend to feel fine with that much caffeine. The other way to increase dopamine and to make sure that your baseline levels of dopamine are high enough is to make sure that you're eating sufficient numbers of tyrosine-rich foods."}

experiment in a strain of mice uh pardon me a strain of yeast I think it was a w303 strain of yeast and he overexpressed sir two um and lo and behold the yeast lived longer now a year later someone else in the same lab took a different strain of yeast and calorically restricted them and they also lived longer um I forget the name of that I forget what that strain was it was something 316 was it but it was a different strain of yeast at that moment again this is about 25 years ago a hypothesis emerged which was we have two different strains of yeast and in one of them when you overexpress sir 2 this gene they live longer and in this other strain if you calorically restrict them they live longer the understandable hypothesis was caloric restriction which we had known was life extending is working through cerin that hypothesis sort of fell apart about four years later when Matt cabin again this time with Brian Kennedy did another experiment in a yet a third strain of yeast that allowed them to test hypothesis because there was a problem with the story I just told when you took the 303 strain this is the strain that when overexpressing sir two lived longer if you took that strain and you calorically calorically restricted them no change that's odd even more odd is when you took the 316 strain and this is the strain that lived longer with CR if if you overexpress sir to no change so right off the bat the story didn't make sense but it was further solidified that that story didn't make sense when Brian and Matt published in 2004 in yet a different strain God I'm blanking on the name it's like uh B by4742 like you know these don't matter if you calorically restricted them they lived longer if you overexpress sir two they lived longer if you did both they lived even longer it was additive again further suggesting that overexpression of sir2 and caloric restriction independently and separately extended lifespan these are parallel Pathways they're parallel Pathways for reasons that honestly Escape me Andrew there are still people who maintain that the benefit of ceran overexpression is through the caloric restriction pathway and vice versa and that's wrong my reading of the literature in addition to every person I have talked to on this who works in the space including Matt cin who has done the most research on this is that there is no evidence that caloric restriction and cerin operate through the same pathway and in that sense I think there's there's relatively uniform agreement that caloric restriction extends life across the model systems we discussed what about in humans what what about it specifically that experiment's never been done and never will be done the joke I was trying to set up for is the one I'll make now which is no one wants to be in the control experiment um that said nobody want want treatment experiment either you got me you got me you beat me to the punch uh no one wants to be in the treatment group either because it requires eating so little yeah you know it just the the yeah the joke is the joke is you probably will live longer and it will feel even worse like it's just it's yeah caloric restriction which by the way there are real debates about whether it will extend life in humans because it will clearly I shouldn't say clearly I think it would be a very safe bet that severe caloric restriction will absolutely reduce the risk of most chronic diseases meaning I I have I think there's very good reason to believe that if an individual constitutively consumed 25% fewer calories than they were

sarcopenia what does that do to your risk of falling fra yeah exactly so you trade one set of diseases for another it's not at all clear that lifespan goes up and by the way when you even look at some of the wild um uh like some of the animal literature where they're using different strains of mice that are not inbred and they don't put them in hermetically sealed uh situations they don't live longer so it's not always the case that caloric restriction extends life and therefore well um it's safe to say caloric restriction probably reduces the onset of chronic disease that might not translate to an all cause mortality benefit based on those downsides but all of that said I think the holster in story got off to an incorrect start where it basically lopped on to the CR story which was hey we've got this thing CR that we've known since restrict right clor restri we've got this thing which you know for 50 years we've known has a signal that really says it's life extending and we've got this yeast where it works and this other yeast where ceran activation works oh it's got to be St but again if you if you go through the story in detail as I just did there's no evidence whatsoever that cerin have anything to do with chloric restriction and vice versa it's incredibly interesting because I think when you look at cell biology and you see these parallel pathways when you see these effects of experiments where changing cerin or changing caloric restriction independently increased lifespan combine the two you get this what appears to be a synergistic effect but it's as you pointed out an additive effect seems like a pretty straightforward experiment to do you could just do an occlusion right you could then put back in the cerin OR adjust calories and see whether or not you get the effectively whether the math is corrected yeah you know so"}

You know, the way that this career was described to me the day I got my job, was one colleague of mine, the late Ben Barres said, welcome to schizophrenia 'cause you're never going to be able to complete anything without getting interrupted. That was partially true, although I've created buffers. And the other one, very successful scientist, member of the National Academy, et cetera, said to me, you know, just remember, it's pinball. You never win. The best you can do is just keep playing. - Yes, right. - And I thought wow, okay. Okay. And then you just go. - Right. - But I think that as we achieve more, not just academics of course, but as anyone achieves more, there's the relishing in the accomplishment. There's often the desire for more, but there's also the pressure of, well now I have to do this for the next 30 years, even though I love it. It's the pressure of, well, if the mountain is this high, then how do I get here and here and here, and then you start shoveling more dirt on so you can keep climbing. And it's a lot of work. - Yes. - And I think that the perception of success is that there's a roar of the crowd and you cruise. You don't cruise. They just give you more to do. - Right. - Or you give yourself more to do. - Well what I think is, at least in my life experience, and I've heard this from other people as well, you know, it's that prize that we're going for, that if we get it is so unsatisfying. And it's the prize that we never imagined that we kind of go, well, how did that happen, but gee, you know, that feels good. And so I'm very, what's the- - It's like a mirage - Yeah. - in the one case. - Yeah. - It's almost like dopamine can create these mirages. - Yes. - That there's some place there. - That's right.

If I just- - Constant dopamine. - Right, right, that's right. - Constant dopamine. - And I think, you know, this really, I think, is related to our discussion earlier about this taking it one day at time, or paying attention to that, you know, 24-hour period in your environment. I am absolutely fascinated by the ways in which we accumulate success, when we do that, totally independent of the desire for success. It's really process-oriented. It's like, where am I today? How can I make today a good and meaningful day, a little bit better, or as good as some other days I've had? Constantly tweaking and experimenting with this experiment that we call our human existence. And when we do that in a way that's authentic and paying attention and value-driven, whatever our, you know, values are informed by, it is very, very interesting how those days again accumulate, and you find, well, I guess I contributed something of value there, but I wasn't trying to do that. You know, I think that's really, I mean, what I'm so amazed by is like, you know, 20 years ago when I went to Stanford Medical School, or 25 years ago, you know, I just, I was happy to just be a good doctor. I was like, I guess I'm just going to try to figure out how to be a good doctor, I'm here to learn that. And now I see these medical students, and they're wonderful. They're brilliant and they're - They are. - well-intentioned, all that. But they're like how can I, you know, write the great American novel, do my startup, go to Africa, apply for that grant? You know, it's like, really, I was just trying to learn how to be a doctor. And it's, as you say, it's a lot of pressure on them. And it's also kind of a weird leapfrogging of the real way to accomplish something. - Right. - Which isn't about like oh how can I accomplish something. It's like, what can I do today that would be of service. Right? And then finding that of trying to be of service, you know, and not really going for recognition, can sometimes lead to what people call success, although that wasn't what you were aiming for. - And it's all the more beautiful when it's not what you're aiming for. - Oh so much better, so much better. - Yeah, I'm a big believer that when one can align their compulsion with some greater good. - Yes, right. - A service to humanity or the planet or animals, whatever it is, that's where the really good stuff emerges. Because there's a lot of reciprocity there. The world starts to, you're supporting the world"}
{"question": "Does ingesting caffeine before exercise enhance the positive feelings and benefits associated with physical activity, making it more enjoyable and increasing motivation to continue exercising?", "doc_id": "iw97uvIge7c_21", "video_id": "iw97uvIge7c", "video_title": "Using Caffeine to Optimize Mental & Physical Performance | Huberman Lab Podcast 101", "video_header": "Tool: Exercise, Caffeine, Dopamine & Positive Reinforcement", "segment_idx": "21", "time_start": "1:56:36", "time_end": "2:01:48", "context": "for enhancing performance. And this relates not just to the dopamine and epinephrine and the arousal-inducing effects of caffeine. And it doesn't even just relate to the effect of caffeine on enhancing frontal lobe function. It does include all that, but it also includes those reinforcing effects of caffeine that we talked about at the beginning of the episode. And the best way to illustrate these performance-enhancing effects of caffeine that stem directly from its association with reinforcement is to highlight a study. And the title of the study is \"Blood dopamine level enhanced by caffeine in men after treadmill running.\" And as the title suggests, this was carried out in men, but there's no reason to think that the same results wouldn't also be present in women. There are some sex-dependent effects of caffeine. I'll touch on just briefly at the end. But those are largely present in kids. That is, adolescents and teens as opposed to adults. So this study is really interesting. What they had people do was run on a treadmill and either ingest caffeine-- again, 3 milligrams per kilogram of body weight-- or to not ingest caffeine. And then they looked at levels of dopamine and other neurotransmitters and hormones, such as prolactin and cortisol. And the basic takeaway is, as the title suggests, that exercise, while on its own, can increase cortisol in healthy ways, provided it's not too intense and too long. A little note here, if you have trouble recovering from exercise or you want to continue to derive the benefits from exercise, in general, best not to do high-intensity exercise for longer than 75 minutes. Or 90 minutes probably being the outer threshold. I realized that there are some genetic freaks out there or people that are chemically assisted that can recover from very intense long bouts of exercise. But most people don't do well through long bouts of intense exercise on a regular basis. And limiting their intense exercise to 60 minutes or less-- that doesn't include the warm-up-- is going to be beneficial. See the episode on tool kit for fitness if you'd like details on that. Exercise is known to increase levels of dopamine, cortisol, and other catecholamines and neurotransmitters very potently and things like testosterone and estrogen in ways that we know are beneficial to us and, of course, have all these positive effects on the musculoskeletal system and cardiovascular effects. But unbeknownst to most people, ingesting 3 milligrams per kilogram of caffeine prior to exercise further increases the dopamine release associated with exercise specifically. And this has two important effects. First of all, that increase in dopamine is great because it provides a long-lasting increase in focus alertness and motivation, not just during the exercise, but also after the exercise. And second, it-- that is, caffeine and dopamine in combination-- act as a reinforcer to make the experience of exercise and the period immediate after exercise more pleasant and, in fact, reinforcing. So in other words, one way to enjoy exercise more and to enjoy the activities that follow exercise more and to experience a genuine increase in dopamine that's beneficial for mood and alertness is to ingest caffeine prior to exercise. Now this is important because a number of people out there are exercising, love exercise, love eating great, love doing all the things that are beneficial for their health, but a number of people out there really don't like to exercise. And that serves as a serious block for their willingness and their consistency to exercise. Ingesting caffeine gives us energy to exercise. It increases the release of neurochemicals and hormones that are good for us during exercise. But as I'm highlighting here, it also increases the reinforcement pathways associated with exercise. That is, it creates a positive feeling about the general theme of engaging in exercise, and it creates a general positive experience of the things that follow exercise. So I think this, if nothing else is a call for or support for the idea, that ingesting caffeine as a performance-enhancing tool makes perfect sense. But for those out there that don't enjoy exercise, in particular, certain forms of exercise, ingesting caffeine can change your relationship to that exercise. In other words, make it more positive, much in the same way that ingesting caffeine alongside a certain taste that would otherwise be neutral or maybe even negative can actually make the taste of that particular drink or food positive. So again, this brings us back to the reinforcing properties of caffeine that are subconscious. It's not just about the enhanced performance in the test or the enhanced performance on the treadmill or with the weights in the gym. It's enhanced feelings of mood and well-being that are genuine because of the effect of caffeine on certain neurotransmitter and hormone systems, but it also is creating an overall milieu of reinforcing all of the things that led in to occur during and occur after exercise."}

Neuroplasticity is this incredible feature of our nervous system that allows it to change itself, even in ways that we consciously decide. That's an incredible property. Our liver can't decide to just change itself. Our spleen can't decide to just change itself, through conscious thought, or through feedback from another person. The cells in those tissues can make changes sure, but it's our nervous system, that harbors this incredible ability to direct its own changes, in ways that we believe, or we're told will serve us better. Now, today's a really special episode because, while we are going to talk about science and as always we will delve into mechanism. Today's episode is really geared toward answering your most common questions about how to leverage neuroplasticity. The previous episodes were about focus, and how to achieve focus for sake of plasticity. As well as the last episode which is, what are some of the portals into plasticity that relate to movement, how behavior can activate plasticity, as well as how to activate plasticity for behavior itself. How to get better at learning certain movements. Today's podcast is really directed toward answering your most common questions, and the bigger theme, of how does one go about optimizing their brain or even think about, optimizing the brain? What is this thing that we're calling optimizing the brain? In doing so I'm also gonna share some of my, typical routines and tools. I don't share these because I think that they are the only ones that are available out there. Certainly they're not. Nor do I share them because I think that everyone should do them just 'cause I do them, certainly not. I share them because many of you, have asked for very concrete examples of what I do and when, and so I'll share those with you and you can decide whether or not those protocols are for you or not. Everybody's different, but there are some common features, of how we are all put together, at the level of the nervous system and body, that direct us toward particular practices, particular routines that can be especially powerful, for neuroplasticity. So I wanna open up the discussion today, by emphasizing something, that's fundamentally important."}
{"question": "What is the current understanding of the Mind-Body Interaction, specifically how mental states such as meditation and respiration practices influence the body and nervous system?",

growing up I was very interested in animals and biology and my father's a scientist and I got very interested in Neuroscience early um as people perhaps know and so much of Neuroscience as I was coming up through the mid90s 2000s 2010 to 20 stretch was focused on the brain piece MH very little on the body there was nothing about gut brain AIS in the early discussions and cours work um in parallel to all of that I've been interested in mental health physical health and let's just call it performance and um got interested in meditation respiration based practices things like Yoga Nidra things that by way of experience I understood immediately had a profound influence on the nervous system states of Mind and Body nowadays there's an entire Institute at the National Institutes of Health for complimentary health and Medicine essentially exploring things like yoganidra respiration practices even supplements and things of that sort and there's this understanding that oh my goodness the nervous system extends into the body and the body sends neural signals back into the brain and so this whole notion of Mind Body has fortunately migrated away from kind of um California counterculture esselin Institute only uh you know um hippie New Age Magic Carpet stuff by the way that's not what I believe that's but that's often how it was looked at in the past and now people at every level of science and medicine and every major university and in every scientific journal are starting to publish papers about the interactions between bodily organs like the breathing apparati the diaphragm lungs the heart heart rate variability we hear about um the liver the gut brain axis in particular and so Mind Body the idea that our thoughts could influence our body and that our bodily State could influence our thoughts is fortunately not just understood but it seems to be both accepted and appreciated so what are your thoughts on mindbody what ises that mean to you and what do you think is the potential of the mindbody interaction it seems to me we've just barely scratch the surface yeah well I'm glad you asked because I think it's a it's a really fascinating uh situation and uh where things are changing very very quickly and I think to me the most important thing for people to understand is that when you have a hypothesis let's say you have a hypothesis that uh meditation can uh attenuate chronic pain all right well there is a temptation to think that this operates outside the realm of Science and biology that is in some arery realm in the clouds that this happens and and and I mean for for good reason there are a lot of people who will describe it in exactly that way with auras or they they Co-op scientific terms like resonance and energy but they don't actually use them in scientific way so you know there's a lot of very fuzzy language that surrounds this but it shouldn't obscure the fact that when you have a hypothesis that say some mental State like meditation or or or guided breathing uh uh affects some process in the body that you should be trying to understand this in terms of a biological hypothesis not in terms of some some some indistinct realm that that is that is different like manifestation yeah and you know I really learned this in initially from my father my father was a psychiatrist in fact kind of a talking cure old-fashioned psychoanalyst had his practice in uh Los Angeles and uh we would have dinner together every Wednesday night and uh he would always tell me about his patience he was very careful to keep confidentiality right he wouldn't great confidentiality but you know I would say oh yes how's your narcissist oh we had this dream so was you know this was this was normal conversation when I was 14 15 years old with my dad and one day I said Dad it's really clear to me that through this talking cure a large fraction of your patients feel better and they conquer their depression or or or their obsessive thoughts or things that are blocking them how do you think it works and he says well we don't really know the mechanics But ultimately when it works it's not working in some araer realm it is was working by changing the biology of the brain and when he said that it was like a lightning bolt went off in my head and I thought well I don't have the kind of personality to be a talking cure psychiatrist I'm not nearly nice enough but I could understand the underlying biology maybe I'll do that uh and so as you've correctly pointed out when you say the phrase Mind Body you're talking about two directions you're talking about mental functions affecting the body and then you were also talking about how phenomena in the body affect affect the mind and we're understanding so much more about how that happens and I think the general thing for your your listeners to appreciate is that we have some culprits here right and generally speaking there are there are two classes of culprits so if you want to get signals about the body to the mind there's two ways to do that one of them is through neurons that reach out into the body and sense things and this is referred to as Inception right so as opposed to extra reception your your outward pointing senses these are the senses that monitor or your own body and and while we can consciously be aware of a lot of that information a lot of it is happening subconsciously like your breathing is happening automatically most of the time without you thinking about it and that depends upon sensors about your blood chemistry and the state of your lungs and a number of other things that are regulating that process and it's all happening in the brain usually below the level of your conscious attention in addition to the neural signals there is also a whole realm of hormonal or diffusible immune signals and what these are is that these are chemicals that are released into the bloodstream and that move throughout the body and that can uh uh activate neurons in the brain or in other parts of the nervous system to produce changes in uh in mental in mental function and I think the real thing that is exciting a lot of people right now has to do with immune signaling molecules so there's a class of molecules called cyto kindes and cyto kindes are basically the signaling hormones of the immune system and they they can flow through the bloodstream and through lymphatic fluid uh and reach many parts of the body uh we've known for a number of years that the specialized receptors for these cyto kindes are found throughout the brain and yet we know very very very little about about what they do and that's going to be an astonishingly fruitful area of scientific research but but to give one one Exemplar um there are a lot of things"}

women feel um psychologically physically what are some of the positive changes that can OCC aside from just offsetting some of the negative and I want to make sure that I remember to ask what if a woman has been in menopause for you know uh has passed that point because as you said it's a day so they passed that point um a year earlier 2 years earlier 3 years earlier um given the results of this first study um which as you explained it are uh problematic and their interpretation the way it was interpreted as opposed to initially yeah yeah um what's too long should um women should wom starten therapy in their 40s just in just to you know smooth the transition maybe we need more studies in this area like should we just the minute we figure out like I would love like I would glucose monitor I have um insulin resistance so for those listening there's just it looks like a little button sized um sticker on the back of the arm I would love to develop one to track estrogen levels starting your 30s just see where you're at you know start seeing are you having aberations in your cycle and we can start the per menopause journey and talking about should we begin supporting I think there's a tremendous amount opportunity for research in this area um but typically we are not starting patients until they're very symptomatic if they're per menopausal or they're postmenopausal so in general so if a woman is um in her let's say late 30s um she is anticipating perimenopause maybe is in per menopause and wants to start lowd dose um hormone replacement therapy I think it's something um worth mentioned that not all you know presumably the dosages are tailored and then blood so a given dose is tried blood is drawn you measure estradi so we're not um we don't have established levels of like therapeutic ranges of estradi what we found is that when we do that so far I think we have some opportunity here if my level's 50 and your level's 50 I could feel like I'm on top of the world my symptoms are gone you still need more so we are titrating from symptoms I see yeah interesting that's similar to what is done similarish with um testosterone replacement therapy which these days um you know I sort of have joke that the you can uh change out the r in testosterone replacement because a lot of people are a lot of men are taking testosterone not as a replacement meaning their levels are not lower than 300 n per deciliter which is kind of lower range um they're sort of low middle and they're trying to get high you know higher range but hormone replacement therapy as I understand it has never been um strictly in men or women strictly for people who are out of range that it in in theory it can be to optimize reduce symptoms right and to optimize well-being right um and I don't know if the medical establishment wants it used that way but certainly in the case of testosterone replacement therapy in men it's being used that way quite often in fact so the we don't have established therapeutic ranges for estrad if she's POI premature Varian insufficiency we know we want to get her to 100 or around 100 or higher in picograms per deciliter um and but in the menopausal patient we're rarely checking levels but I do think we have an opportunity to learn a lot more now that we're able to track how is it how does it affecting your cholesterol we need to look at those numbers like what's the optimal dose for cholesterol what's the optimal dose for cardiovascular disease all we all these Studies have looked at was was she on it or not so that's where I think the opportunities can come so if a woman goes on hormone replacement therapy how often is she coming in for blood draws or are you just you know well depend testosterone we tend check more often there's we don't have an FDA approved option for women for testosterone and so no so we either try to get her t- stem mhm um or she's finding someone to insert a pellet or something and there's there's other issues with that um what I do in Te Texas it's really hard the pharmacists do not like to do the t- stem for patients and I've even T t- stem is the gel you know um and I end up compounding it in a cream and do a transdermal PR for the patients but there's such variable absorption we do tend to check more levels of that just to may try to get her therapeutic so what for women at Peak dose is somewhere in a healthy female you know 35 to 70 and it's so so I had a woman coming in with signs of hyperandrogenism you know she's you know deep voice hair growth whatever acne and I'm going to check a level if it's above 90 for females I need to look for a tumor like that's too high okay or PCOS it can get that high certainly 200 that's that's outrageous so I'm trying to get my patients you know 60 50 70 but if she's like 50 and her she's got her libido back and she feels great and everything's wonderful then I'm hold you know because the higher we go the more likely you are to have side effects so you're losing hair you know temporal hair loss voice steepening acne new chin hair you know losing hair where you want it gaining here where you don't want it is how I explain it to patients and so when you say 50 that's 50 nanograms per de I think um many people including myself were surprised to learn um that women actually have higher levels of testosterone than they do estrogen um outside absolute ranges right in absolute ranges and I can tell you right now your natural level of estradiol is higher than mine now I'm I supplement but you know like when I go through menopause your residual estradi is now higher than a postmenopause a woman so this is the uh estrad that I have because testosterone was aromatized into into EST yeah interesting interesting uh so much uh is breaking down around the uh the old stereotypes female hor like testosterone is a human hormone right estrogen's a human hormone and they exist in in both U biological Sexes yeah it's um it it's sometimes unfortunate that compounds in the body get names like steroid hormones because then people hear steroids and then it has a gravitational pull toward um anabolic steroid use um or uh even the word fat you know it's like you know dietary fat versus subcutaneous fat versus fat we need better nomenclature um to avoid a lot of the confusion that exists out there what are some of the other hormones that um can be reduced and can possibly be replaced by hormone"}

And they can look to experiences that they've survived and say, oh, I made it through, or I'm resilient or not. But is there a way that we can-- certainly that we can train it by doing hard things? Cold showers, this kind of thing are small examples of those. But do you think it's even an important question to ask? And if it is, how does one go about thinking, how resilient am I? Should we put ourselves into situations of discomfort just to test that? Because I will say, I think a lot of people look to SEAL Teams and team guys in particular as a calibration point of like, OK, they know how to do hard things. They were selected for the ability to carry logs, and get into cold water over and over, and roll in the sand, and go without sleep for a week or so. But that's probably not what they were doing when they were on deployment. It's clearly a pressure test for something else. JOCKO WILLINK: Yeah, it's a strange, strange thing. The Basic Underwater Demolition SEAL training. And quite frankly, going and getting wet and cold and being miserable is actually nothing compared to being on deployment. And a good example that I use to compare this to is, when I was on deployment in 2006 in Ramadi, there was-- as you were driving off base to go into the city and conduct operations, as you drove out of the compound, on your right was this area that was called the vehicle graveyard. And the vehicle graveyard was exactly what it sounds like. It was probably 75 or 100 vehicles that were blown up, destroyed, burned, in various twisted conditions that had been dragged back through the city and put into this vehicle graveyard. And as you drove by that vehicle graveyard, you know without question that every one of those twisted vehicles represented one, two, three, four, five, American casualties horribly wounded, killed. And there you are in a vehicle about to roll out into that city where what you're looking at can easily be you in the next three minutes. And you're going to do that today. You're going to do that tomorrow. You can do that the next day and the day after that and the day after that. That compared to-- and by the way, this isn't just seals that are doing that. This is Marines, this is the army guys that are over there. This is what everyone is doing. And they do it. They do it. I talk about Marc Lee who was one of my guys. First CO killed in Iraq. And he was the lead turret gunner in the lead Humvee. And in Vietnam, if you were the point man in Vietnam, if you're in infantry patrol, you're the point man in Vietnam, you were at risk-- booby traps, ambush. So they rotated you out. You didn't have to stay up there all the time. You do an hour up as point man, they get someone else up there. And that guy, the lead turret gunner in a Humvee column of four, or five, or six vehicles, if you hit an IED, that's the vehicle that's going to hit it. If you go into an ambush, that's the guy that's going to get hits. The guy that's standing up in a 50 caliber turret, that's the guy that's going to die. And Marc-- he was a new guy, so he's in that lead turret, 50 Cal. And he never asked to get rotated out. And I remember he was a very-- I like to say very. He was extremely charismatic, funny, gregarious comedian. And we got all kinds of stories about Marc. But one of them, we were in Vegas, and we're all gambling. And I come down from my hotel room, and I see Marc across the-- he's playing blackjack. When he sees me, he goes, hey, sir, when are the new Cadillacs coming out. Like he's just lighting up everybody, just having a fantastic time. But I remember one night he's getting ready to roll out. And if I wasn't going out with the platoons, I would go out see the guys off, give them a hands salute as they're leaving. And I'm like, how are you feeling, Marc? How you doing, Marc? Are you good to go? And he's like, feeling lucky, sir. That was his attitude. And he's a guy that's going to drive by that vehicle graveyard, drive right out of that city, and he's going to do it the next day, and the day after that, and the day after that. So-- and like I said, that's what the army guys are doing. That's what the Marine Corps guys are doing. They're doing it. And so as much as the mythology around basic SEAL training goes, to me that experience in combat and what guys do is infinitely harder and infinitely more important. Now, all that being said, basic SEAL training is a very strange laboratory for human beings. It is a very strange laboratory for human beings. And it's crazy the way it works. It's obviously extremely difficult, but there's no-- I wouldn't put money. You could put odds on somebody making it through like, hey, that guy seems like he's going be good to go. But I wouldn't put a bunch of money on it. And I wouldn't take like 100%, I would never take 100% bet on anybody because there's no one that's 100% going to make it through that training. And there's just random-- some people say, well, it's because your why. There's people that make it through SEAL training because their ex-girlfriend said they couldn't make it. There's some other guy that makes it through because they promised God that they would make it. There's some other guy that made it through because their dad said they could never. There's lie every one of these examples you can come up with. And it's good enough for some random dude to make it through. And it doesn't matter what your pedigree is. It doesn't matter where you're from. There's guys from Iowa. There's guys from Florida. There's guys from wherever that make it. And those guys from Iowa, and those guys from Florida, and those guys from wherever, that don't make it. Guys from farms. Guys from silver spoon in their mouth, and you just can't predict it. And I mean, it has to have something to do with the fact that how bad you actually want to do it. That's-- it's a strange thing. And I wouldn't try and-- if I was in the world, if I didn't do that training, I wouldn't be trying to figure out if I could make it or not because you don't know. You don't know. It's a very strange thing. And it's so mythical almost right now. It's mythical that how hard it is. And this is not too many people make it through, man. It's-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: 15%. JOCKO WILLINK: --yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, from all the folks that I've talked to there, or gone through, been instructors there, some we both know, it seem that that 15% number is unlikely to change as long as they keep the process the same. It just seems about 15% of people seem to have something in them that can perhaps grow during that training. But that it is being identified and selected for rather than somehow being built up across at least that phase, the early phases of training. And then at some point they build on that capacity. And this gets to this really somewhat controversial issue frankly, are people wired differently? And listen, I started off in neural development. And I'll tell you that there are some universal properties of neural development in all surviving humans. Like that you're going to breathe without having to think about it. Your heart is going to beat without having to think about it. But beyond that, there's a lot of variation in natural levels of dopamine and serotonin. There's nature plays a powerful role and nurture. And what's interesting, though, is we can't always predict from parents what nature is going to do. Recently we had someone on the podcast. I'm excited for you to listen to it if perhaps you will if I send it to you. There's a guy who talks about inheritable acquired traits. You don't expect that because you work out that your grandkids will be more muscular and have better endurance. But there's actually some evidence that that may be the case. And you go, well, how could that be? We got two kinds of cells in your body. It turns out you have what are called somatic cells, which are all of them. Then you have the germ cells, which are your sperm and your wife's eggs. Well, why wouldn't the DNA of the sperm cells and the egg cells be modifiable by experience if all the other cells are? And it turns out there's some evidence that maybe it's not the DNA but the rNRA. Think about that. That means that whether-- and we know this that people that have been in a famine, several generations later, their implications for blood sugar regulation in their great grandkids. So the idea that experience and acquired traits can change us is actually has some validity. And this gets into really complicated things to people who go, oh, this is like the giraffe that had to crane its neck, and then gave birth to longer necked giraffes. And it's like, well, not exactly but also not entirely untrue either. So I love the idea that there are inherited traits and that nature and nurture play a role, but that hard work may actually transmit across generations. JOCKO WILLINK: Yeah, there's in SEAL training you have kids that come through that they call legacies, which means that they have a dad-- I think a dad, brother, whatever. And they do have a better chance of making it, but it's not a guaranteed chance at all. And my personal opinion is I think a legacy kid would have a better chance of making it just due to the Thanksgiving dinner that you're going to have to go through for the rest of your life with your family-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: If you don't. JOCKO WILLINK: --yeah, if you're even invited, which you might be on your own. But yeah, maybe there's something to that as well. But I think that's just more the pressure that someone must feel like, hey, there's no way I'm going to be allowed back in my home if I don't make it through this training. So I'm going to have to just go ahead and suck it up. But not everyone makes it. And it's a bummer when that does occur. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, for people who are not thinking about going through SEAL training, or who"}

well I have four of my own and I have two step kids and um they all skate my daughter not so much anymore but all the boys five boys uh are all really into it um my oldest son is the most uh he's the most prominent because he turned Pro um and has I mean you know has his own following has a name for himself uh Riley and he's 30. yeah he kills it on Street he's a big street skateboarder he does yeah um but that you know they're they're all good they're all good skaters in their own ways and uh it's so fun I mean I I I didn't of course they're surrounded by it their whole life especially Riley because when he was young I I didn't really have the means to have child care whatever so I just said take him with me on tourism and whatnot so he was always around it so he got good at it by default but at some point started to shy away from him because he felt the pressure and My Shadow and it was like I don't this isn't fun I don't people expect me to be super good or I have to do this stuff and so he went shied away from it but then found a bunch of his friends in high school they love skating he's still good at us so he that he found his crew and they've all found their Crews uh completely independent of me and so when we go on vacation for instance we we were last year we were in uh or two years ago we were on the big on Hawaii they want to go to Ski parks I don't want to go to the skate parks I'm on vacation it's also a little harsh stuff it's a great way to get hurt right what's that over in Hawaii it's all weather worn oh yeah and it's not even my scene but but then so I go I'm I'm so I'm their chauffeur and I'm their Filmer I love it that's my vacation but but because they all love it so much you know what I mean and it just it's so cool like I mean how could I ever ask for more it's amazing let's talk about Frank and Nancy a little bit just because I have this kind of odd connection to your family through those uh it's really two or three day interaction changed my life forever meeting you was spectacular as a young skateboarding kid but also just the idea that someone would literally take me into their home I mean they had every reason to not trust me first of all I was hanging out with Billy Waldman no explanation needed the people who knew Billy I hope he's doing well I haven't heard anything about him but hope he's doing well um but we were wild but he basically took me into your home he and Nancy took me in um you know fed us um or fed me um I had another friend with me um and you know it I just have to say as you're describing your family I can only imagine what it must have been like for Frank and Nancy to see you have your kids did they get to um live long enough to see uh that Riley and your other kids were skateboarders my dad met Riley uh but my dad passed away when Riley was two so he's the only one of my kids that that he met yeah um my older sibling uh had kids so he met two of his other grandkids besides Riley um my mom got to see some of Riley's success but uh she suffered from Alzheimer's dementia and so things slipped away but um I I think that uh my dad would not believe that skateboarding is in the Olympics to him that's that is the top of the mountain because he was really into other sport he loved Sports he loved the Olympics he loves he loved watching football he loved watching baseball he loves when the Olympics were on he just he loved the competition element and the hype of it and and I think there was part of him that felt like why isn't skateboarding in this you know but he knew that there were so many hurdles to get through and so much more acceptance that needed to happen and I don't think he imagined would ever happen yeah he was a special guy I can still hear his voice he was a very large guy too I don't know if he I was just smaller then I definitely was smaller oh yeah no I mean he had like a big presence and um and I know I've told you this many times before this is actually how we got reconnected I sent you a direct message and said hey I met your parents in fact they took me into your home and I'm telling the truth and you'll know I'm telling the truth because they took me to dinner and they ordered black coffee after dinner and you know for years I would order black coffee after dinner you know as a kid you're just so impressionable these really nice people took me in I was like wow this is what a really healthy family looks like I'm grateful to have loving parents I always did but yeah I didn't have the healthy family structure so for me it was like oh my goodness these people drink black coffee after this must be what healthy families do so by the way folks don't drink caffeine within eight hours of going to sleep but um but I still do that but well you it doesn't seem to be holding you back um individualized but um yeah it's spectacular that this lineage of you know Frank to you and and I I mentioned and Nancy because it seems like while she might not have been at the contest and run around setting up tables and doing all that like she clearly was supportive as well oh oh she was I did a lot of the events too I mean they needed all hands on deck when it started getting big and no one was taking salaries you know that's the thing is that people thought like oh your dad's like cashing on he never took up money for any of that and he took so much you know what I mean he just he just loved it it was for you well it was for me and it was also for the Misfits that I surrounded myself with and even though he was he was Brash and he was like you know he was uh I don't know what's the word he was foreboding and intimidating and whatever else he did it for all those kids that were kind of lost like you I mean really like he he loved that it brought them together that he gave them a sense of self it gave them a sense of purpose he saw that because he he was that he he really had a rough childhood and he did everything he could through his adult life to make up for it with his own kids and with the kids that they surrounded themselves with so that's that's what he loved about it of course he loved seeing me Thrive too but he loved that he created the safe space and this this sense of community and so my mom my mom was that was her thing was getting people together gatherings you know oh we should all get together like even even my siblings and I as much as we want to emulate our parents we don't do it as much that as they did and we regret that well there's still time no we I mean we do but yeah um It's Tricky we're all different areas sure yeah the the person that comes to mind when I think about your dad I'm forgetting the movie but there's this one Clint Eastwood movie where he lives in a neighborhood where I think it's a bunch of young Hmong oh is that gangsters El Camino El Camino yeah and I just remember like there's that scene of like Clint coming out on his porch and just standing really upright yeah everything in his front his front lawn is everything's super manicured and just standing there like this immense presence and that's how I remember Frank Hawk yeah but he was a total softy that's the thing that's that's the you know there there was a it was it was all a front well he was certainly very precious like you you know you you got you got to see that side of him where it's just like oh yeah come on we'll we'll take you out you want to go see Tony's Place let's go like that's not some hard ass well there's a tail end of the story too where he actually called my mom and I think there may have been a statement or two about hey this kid's 14 like he can't be in Linda Vista Boys Club taking the bus back to Lancaster et cetera et cetera may have been some discussion like that but then they also paid for me to go home oh yeah they flew me home yeah so I think I owe you a couple hundred bucks for a Southwest flight or whatever Airline it was well it's it's fun and I think important to reminisce about these people because um they aren't just your parents but they've done so much and through you you know I I really think that um emotions and stories are really like the equivalent of energy in humans you know when people talk about energy because that gets carried forward um speaking of which we share a common love of some particular music are you"}
{"question": "Is it possible for our brains to combine the distinct signals from smell and taste to create a single, unified sensory experience, and if so, how does this process work?", "doc_id": "UChhXiFPRgg_16", "video_id": "UChhXiFPRgg", "video_title": "Dr. Charles Zuker: The Biology of Taste Perception & Sugar Craving | Huberman Lab Podcast #81", "video_header": "Integration of Odor & Taste, Influence on Behavior & Emotion", "segment_idx": "16", "time_start": "1:09:15", "time_end": "1:17:22", "context": "This was based on a conversation I had with a former girlfriend where we were talking about chemistry between individuals. Very complicated topic on the one hand. But on the other hand, quite simple in that certain people, for whatever reason, evoke a tremendous sense of arousal, for lack of a better word, between two people, one would hope, at least for some period of time. - I didn't know this was that kind of a podcast. - No, well, the reason I, but this has to do with taste because she said something, I think in part to maybe irritate me a bit, but we were commenting not about our own experience of each other, but of someone that she was now very excited about we're on good terms. And she said, \"What do you think it is, this thing of chemistry?\" So maybe she was trying to- - Warn you of what's coming. - Warn me what's coming. And she said, \"I have a feeling something about it is in smell and something about it is actually in taste, literally the taste of somebody's breath.\" That's the way she described it. And I thought that it was a very interesting example for a number of reasons, but in particular, because it gets to the merging of odor and taste. But also to the idea that of course the context of a new relationship, I'm assuming that, and in fact, they're both attractive people, et cetera. There's a whole context there, but I've had the experience of the odor of somebody's breath being aversive. Not because I could identify it as aversive. - Because you just didn't like it. - But because I just didn't like it. - But that's because you associated with added odors that trigger that negative aversive reaction, by the way. - Absolutely. There are certain perfumes to me that are aversive. - You got it. - And there are other sense, I can recall a sense of skin, of foods, et cetera, that are immensely appetitive. So I've experienced both sides of this equation myself. And she was describing this and to me more than tasting wine, which is the typical example where people inhale it and then they drink it, to me, this seems like something that more people might be able to relate to, that certain things and people smell delicious. Even mothers describing the smell of their baby's head. - A mother, or us. - Of course, men too, yeah. - I mean our own babies when in their necks, that's the magical place. - Their neck. - The back of their neck. - There you go. - Oh my goodness. I have a grandchild now. So I know exactly what, Rio, that's his name, smells like. - Okay. So more beautiful examples. It's always more fun to think about the beautiful positively appetitive examples. The smell of the back of your grandson's neck. I mean, you could get more specific than that, but not a lot more specific exactly. So what is going on in terms of the combination of odor and taste given that these two systems are so different? - Yes, and they come together, ultimately there is a place in the brain where they come together to integrate the two into what we would call that sensory experience. And I'll tell you an experiment that you could do that demonstrates this. I think it's good for the, for your audience here to get a sense of how we approach these problems so that we can get in a meaningful scientific answers. So we know where the olfactory cortex is in the brain. We know where the taste cortex is in the brain. They're in two different places. We can go to each of these two, cortexes, put color traces, we put green in one, we put red in the other and we see where the colors go to. That's a reflection of where those neurons are projecting into their next targets. Once they get the signal, where do they send the signal to? And then we reason that if odor and taste come together somewhere in the brain, we should find an area that now it's getting red and green color. And we found such an area. And next we anticipated, we hypothesized that maybe this is the area in the brain of the mouse, corresponding area in the brain of humans, that integrates odor and taste. It's known as, the term normally used is multisensory integration. And if this is true, we could do the following experiment. We can train a mouse to lick sweet. And if they guess correctly, that that is supposed to be sweet. They should go now to the right port, to the right side, to get a water reward. If they go to the lift, when it was sweet, then they're incorrect and they get no reward and they actually get a time out. Now the mice are thirsty, so they're very motivated to perform. And if you repeat this task a hundred times, a hundred trials, incredibly enough, this animal learned to recognize the sweet and execute the right action. And by their action, we now are being told what that animal is tasting. We can make it more interesting and we can give him sweet and bitter and say, if it's sweet go to the right and if it's bitter go to the left. And after you train him this mice with 90% accuracy, it'll tell you, when you randomize now the stimuli, what was sweet and what was bitter? We can now do the same experiment, but now mix taste with odor and say, if you got odor alone, go to the right or push this lever in mice. If you get taste alone, go to this other part or push this other lever. And if you get the two together, do this something else. And if you train the mice, the mice are able now to report back to you when it's sensing taste alone, odor alone, or the mix. Makes sense? - Makes sense. - Now we can go to the brain of this mice and go to this area that we now uncover, discover as being the side of multisensory integration between taste and odor, and silence it, prevent it from being activated experimentally. And if that area really represented the integration of these two, the animals should still be able to recognize the taste alone. They still should be able to recognize the other alone, but should be incapable now to recognize the mix, and exactly as predicted. That's exactly what you get. All right? - The brain is basically a series of engineered circuits, complex. - You got it. And our task is to figure out how can we extract this amazing architecture of these circuits in a way that we can begin to uncover the mysteries of the brain. - And why certain people's breath tastes so good and other people's not so good. - Exactly. So I never answered that, but I told you how we can figure out where in the brain it's happening. - As we've been having this discussion,"}

And if there's nothing in there what happens is the muscles that line the sides of your stomach they kind of extend around the stomach and these cables, those are always there and if you have food in your stomach, what they do is they churn your stomach. They literally turn the muscles of your stomach like a tumbler to help break up the food that presumably you didn't chew well enough 'cause you were eating too fast. When you don't have any food in your stomach that churning continues. And that contraction of the muscle, the turning, literally turning over of your muscles they don't flip over completely, but the turning over the muscles, that's what causes the stomach growling.

middle of course but some folks hyperfocused right and you might just metaphorically imagine them at the the extreme like like obsessive compulsive almost right you can't get unstuck from a routine and the other end would be folks who explore too readily right so folks who we would say have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and so folks fall somewhere along that distribution now we've seen that there are differences between species in terms of where they are on that difference is a function of uh age uh in humans so you kind of move from being more hyper exploratory toward more focused as you get older oh good um and that also one of the things that we've um talked about a lot is that that variation where you are on that continu Continuum might make you more or less suited to different types of careers different types of jobs it's not to say that people can't change but think of it this way uh for you've got a dial that goes from Super Focus to a major Explorer and that and creativity goes along with that uh one person might come with their dial set at three another person at seven and you could help that person at a three maybe turn Theirs to five but probably to 10 right a person is a seven you could turn them up to nine right so through through various kinds of practices and so I think it's really important to just recognize that people do vary um and that

also see that um it's often comorbid with other issues related to uh anxiety bipolar Etc so they're kind of like all all cluster there with a with a a real issue um on that sort of focus and uh we work with um with a with a team out in Berkeley actually that provides support to entrepreneurs so that um so so that they can do their best do their thing which is to be like wildly creative right and to and Innovative I should say um but when they need that Focus so they can have it and we have we have a a a big research project going on right now looking at entrepreneurs in California and also MBA students at Wharton to just kind of try to identify you know the prevalence of these issues and then to potentially Provide support for them and that support could take any number of different forms it could be true psychiatric support in the sense of like maybe um you know attention focusing uh uh Pharmaceuticals drugs like like Ridin Aderall which can be used appropriately um but that doesn't Rob those individuals of their Mojo but in other cases it's going to be more like changing their you know providing an ecosystem right so where they can learn uh focusing practices as we've we've already talked about uh where when they build their teams they can um build complimentary strengths in the people that uh surround them so that they're much more likely to be successful and our economy depends on those people being successful right so that's where the vast majority of economic activity is coming from is people who start small businesses who are entrepreneurs and who are who are innovators so it makes all the sense in the world um to do that but I think we've been neglecting all this now actually the thing wanted to kind of say earlier about this and that where I think Neuroscience gives us a new tool to approach a lot of these business questions is that uh let's imagine you're hiring right and you're hiring you we need a creative type okay so you you put an ad out and uh you get you know resumés and responses and people come in for interviews how do you measure that creativity typically when you going say oh how creative are you and you're like you really want the job so you're like yeah I'm super creative you know like or you give them a personality test for example or you like Myers Briggs or something like that and um we know those are not particularly accurate and self-report can be not only uh inaccurate but but biased and biased by the context why am I here who's asking me a question how is that question asked whereas the Neuroscience Neuroscience gives us tools to kind of measure those things directly MH and in some cases you could measure it directly from the brain and we do that but that's not going to be practical not going to be scalable right um not going to be something a lot of people want to uh you know Embrace let's say as as applicants but find ways to interrogate the brain that are not asking people to assess themselves for instance what what would uh a small number of questions be that question one of the things that we've done is develop games like brief little very engaging games that are based on specific tasks that we know interrogate specific circuits in the brain like foraging for example uh where you know people are they're literally harvesting berries let's say okay and they're and they're going along and the goal is to kind of get as as many as you can and from their behavior we can figure out exactly where they are on that Continuum U mathematically and say okay well in the dashboard that we create like okay you are a little you are pitched a bit more toward uh being an innovator and creative type Explorer and and less so less likely to be say a good manager who would need to be you know sort of have a higher degree of focus and we do that for um for a number of different aspects of of you know of of cognitive emotional performance so things like uh uh like for in terms of social competence for example and so we have a little actually a little game it's it's mimic soccer and we've had monkeys play it humans play it we know exactly what it what it kind of uh elicits from the brain and what circuits it relies on and that allows us to numerically you know identify like your strategic planning abilities or your something like theory of mind getting in the head uh of an opponent and those games we found it's it's really uh been very gratifying to uh demonstrate that those predict performance in you know a number of different jobs in high performance jobs like soccer play actual soccer players but also in the military in um in cyber operations um and so we're now exploring and and we're helping we've helped to stand up a startup company uh in Philadelphia that is actually you know that's that's their mission is to go out uh and and try to use those tools to see if they can do better than basically a whole bunch of questions yeah it certainly goes Way Beyond um kind of typical Myers Briggs or anagram type personality tests which I think has certain value if nothing else they uh you know people like to know about themselves and um I I do think categorizing oneself a little bit according to it like are you a three on the anagram or a four or an eight you know what um certainly gives you a a a frame of reference but it yeah it doesn't seem very useful for the kinds of uh work environments that that you're describing whereas what you're describing sounds much more sophisticated um you mentioned theory of mind we should talk about theory of mind"}

{"question": "What is the main reason why teenagers tend to want to spend more time with friends and peers rather than adults during puberty and adolescence?", "doc_id": "hcuMLQVAgEg_19", "video_id": "hcuMLQVAgEg", "video_title": "The Science of Emotions & Relationships", "video_header": "Testing Driving Brain Circuits For Emotion: Dispersal", "segment_idx": "19", "time_start": "1:00:26", "time_end": "1:07:40", "context": "about some of the core needs that occurred during puberty and adolescence, not just for parents or for the people that might be in puberty and adolescence, but also so that people can reflect on which of the sort of boxes were checked off for them as they approached emotional maturity. So there's a terrific review article that was published in the journal Nature, which is, if not the premier, then certainly among the top three premier journals in the field of science about the biology of adolescence and puberty, as well as some of the core needs and demands that have to be met for successful emotional maturation during that time. We will provide a link to that, but I just want to highlight a few of the things that they place in the final table. I don't want to go through all the results right now, because you could do that on your own if you like. They mainly highlight a lot of the changes in neurons and neural circuits. For instance, I'll just highlight one, there's a connection between the dopamine centers in the brain and an area of the brain that's involved in emotion and dispersal. Dispersal is very interesting. What you observe in animals and humans is that around the end of adolescence and during the transition to puberty, both because of changes in the brain and changes in hormones there's an intense desire on the part of the child to get further and further away from primary caregivers, not permanently, they always return, similar to a child that walks off and then looks back and sees if everything's safe and then continues on. During adolescence and puberty, both in animals and in kids, it almost seems like there's a bias for action, and the action is always in a direction away from the primary caregiver. Now, as soon as I say that, I can just imagine in my mind that somebody out there saying, \"Well, no, my kid as soon as they hit puberty, they just want to stay home with us all the time.\" That's not typical. It happens, but it's not typical. Mostly there's a desire to start spending more time with friends, more time with peers and less time with adults. And I find it extremely interesting to note that that's not just true in humans, that's true in other primate species. That's true in rodents. That's true in almost every other mammalian species. So there's something about these hormones that don't just allow sexual reproduction. They don't just change the brain and bodily organs and the shape of us, they also bias us towards dispersal, getting further and further away from primary caregivers in particular. So parents of teenagers or future teenagers, it is not just normal, it is baked in to the biology of humans to disperse around adolescents and in the teen years. So again, I just want to highlight a few of these, what were listed as intervention strategies to promote healthy adolescence and puberty. It's very interesting because the entire article, I should mention who wrote this article, apologies. One of them is a friend of mine. So the first author is Ronald Dahl, not the children's book author, I'm assuming, no, from the School of Public Health at University of California, Berkeley and Nicholas Allen, Linda Wilbert and Anna Balanoff Suliman, forgive me for the pronunciation of the last one. I know Dr. Wilbert quite well. She's done the work on dispersal, is quite well known for that work, and it's a very extensive review, but I think you'll find it accessible. A lot of changes and thickness of the brain at different stages, et cetera. But I think most people will be interested in what that translates to in the real world. And what's interesting is during puberty, there's increased connection, connectivity as we call it between the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in motivation and decision-making, being able to suppress action for making long-term goals possible, as well as dopamine centers and the amygdala. So there's this really broad integration and testing. I think this is the key element here, testing of circuits for emotions and reward as they relate to decisions. And I think that's useful because when you look at the behavior of adolescents and teens, they are testing social interactions, they are testing physical interactions with the world. Oftentimes they're engaging in unsafe behavior. I would never try and justify that with the underlying neurology, but the neuroscience points to increased connectivity between areas of the brain that are related to emotionality and to threat detection like the amygdala, but also reward. So it's a time of testing behaviorally how different behaviors lead to success or not. It's how different behaviors lead to fear states or not. Now, of course you could say that of any stage of development, but it seems like puberty is a very, very heightened stage in which testing of contingencies, good or bad is taking place. And of course it's operating in a body that's now more capable than the infant. So an infant can damage themselves through error, but it's harder for them to damage themselves through deliberate planning. That's why it's important of course, to lock up all the medications in the house, make sure infants can't get to them, but it's not likely that the infant is going to devise an extremely diabolical plan to get into the cabinet to get a certain substance. Whereas a teenager might. So you can start to map the neurology onto some of this emotional exploration. I do realize that this episode is about emotions. Puberty is a time in which the internal state of the person or the animal is being sampled and tested against different exteroceptive events, only now they are able to guide those events with more urgency. It's no longer just about whether or not the caregiver is bringing you milk or bringing you food. Now, of course, the parents will all say, \"Yeah, but I'm paying for everything that they're doing. I'm paying for the car and I'm paying for the food.\" Ah, true. But the biology doesn't care about the source, the child or the adolescent is now able, the teen really, is able to now sample many, many more exteroceptive events through behavior. So some of these recommendations are interesting. The theory is that one of the motivations is to learn to mitigate the risk of famine and malnutrition. As teenagers get older, they start questioning whether or not their parents are everything they thought they were, whether or not they're the greatest thing that ever was or the worst thing that ever was, perhaps. Including whether or not they will be able to provide them resources. So they test whether or not they can actually feed themselves, whether or not they can support themselves. Although rarely not, certainly it happens, but rarely are they really taking care of themselves. Although some teens are forced to take care of themselves of course, because parents and other caretakers aren't available. The recommendations that map to the biology include, there's been a big push for later start times in schools"}

You get into a hot bath and, oh my God, it's really hot, almost painful. And then you sit down and eventually it doesn't feel so hot anymore, because the still water, which is close to your skin, is coming into equilibrium with your skin. So it's like having a blanket on you or an insulator on you. And then if you move around, you disturb that still water layer. You feel the hot temperature again. - I see, so if I were to get into a cold ice bath or very cold body of water of some kind and stay still, I'd likely feel warmer at least until I- - You're not going to be losing as much heat. - I see. - Right. - And then when I move in- - If you flail around, if you flail around, then you're going to lose more heat. - Got it. - Yeah.

{"question": "If I had to stay awake for four or five hours instead of my normal sleep schedule, would my system still be able to enter rapid eye movement sleep at the usual time, or would it need to start over with slow wave sleep first?", "doc_id": "gbQFSMayJxk_5", "video_id": "gbQFSMayJxk", "video_title": "Dr. Matt Walker: The Science & Practice of Perfecting Your Sleep", "video_header": "Compensating For Lost Sleep", "segment_idx": "5", "time_start": "24:00", "time_end": "32:14", "context": "I have one question, which is you're saying that as across the night, a greater percentage of these 90 minute cycles are going to be occupied by REM sleep as you progress through the night. I'm aware that, based on work that you've done and from your public education efforts and others that we have so called circadian forces, and we have other forces that are driving when we sleep and when we want to sleep, etcetera. Without going into the details of those, I've a simple question, the experiment is the following. Let's say, God forbid, you are prevented from going to sleep at your normal time and you stay up for the four hours or five hours that normally you would be in predominantly slow wave sleep. - If let's say you finally get to lie down at 3am a time when normally your sleep would be occupied mostly by rapid eye movement sleep, will you experience a greater percentage of rapid eye movement sleep because of these so called circadian forces, meaning that's what's appropriate for that time? Or will your system need to start at the beginning of the race that were, as I'm referring to it, that we're calling sleep? And for if that's not clear to anybody, basically, what I'm asking is, if you are forced to skip the slow wave sleep part of the night, will your system leap into rapid eye movement sleep? Or does it have to start at the beginning and get slow wave sleep first? In other words, does one sleep state drive the entry to the next sleep state? - Great question, so there is some degree of reciprocity between the sleep states I should note that when we drive one of those up, we often but not always see a change in the other. There are some pharmacologies that have shown an independence to that. And we've also played around with things like temperature, and sometimes you can, you know, nudge one and not seem to upset or perturb the other. But to your, I think, lovely point, the answer is, it's a mix, but it's mostly the latter. Meaning you will mostly go into your REM sleep phases, and be significantly deficient in your deep sleep. So just because I start my sleep cycle at 3am, rather than at 10:30pm, it doesn't mean that my brain just says, well, I've got a program, and I'm just going to run the program, and the way the program runs is that we always start with a first couple of hours of deep sleep. So we're just going to begin act number one, scene one, it doesn't do that. Now, I will get some deep sleep to begin with and part of that is just because of how sleep works. Based on how long I've been awake, longer I'm awake, there is a significantly greater pressure for deep sleep. But we actually use exactly what you just described as an experimental technique to selectively deprive people of one of those stages of sleep or the other. So we will do first half of the night deprivation, and then let you sleep the second half. So that means that you will be mostly deep sleep deprived, and you will still get mostly all of your REM sleep. And then we switch it, so you only get your first four hours, which means you will mostly get deep non REM sleep, but you will get almost no REM sleep. So in both of those groups, they've both had four hours of sleep. So the difference between them in terms of an experimental outcome is not the sleep time because they both slept for the same amount. It's the contribution of those different stages. Now, we actually have more elegant methods for sort of selectively going in there and scooping out different stages of sleep. But that's the way we used to do it old school was just using this timing difference. - And who suffers more? Those that lack the early phase, and were those that lack the later phase of the night sleep? In other words, if I have to sleep only four hours for whatever reason, am I better off getting the early part of the night's sleep or the second half of the night sleep? - Depends on what the outcome measure is. - So that gets right to the differences between slow wave sleep and REM. - Right. - I was probably misinformed. But my understanding a very crude understanding I should say before. - I very much doubt I'll contrary with someone like you. - Which is that's very nice of you. The first part of the night the slow wave sleep is restorative to the musculature to motor learning, and that the dream content tends to be less emotional. The second half of the night, being more emotional dreams and sort of the unpairing of the emotional load of our previous day and other experiences. So in other words, if I were to deprive myself, excuse me of REM, I would be hyper emotional, not maybe not as settled with the kind of experiences of my life. Whereas if I deprive myself of slow wave sleep, I would feel a more physical malaise. Is that correct? Or is that far too simple? And if it is too simple, please tell me where I'm wrong? - No, I think much of that is correct. And it's sort of that plus. So for example, during deep non REM sleep, that's where we get this. It's almost a form of natural blood pressure medication. And so when I take that away from you, the next day, we're usually going to see autonomic dysfunction, we're usually going to see abnormalities in heart rate blood pressure. We also know that during deep non REM sleep, that there is a certain control of specific hormones. For example, we know that the insulin regulation of sort of metabolism, meaning how will you look from a regulated blood sugar perspective versus dysregulated, pre diabetic look of profile. That's where deep sleep seems to matter if we selectively deprive you of that we can see. - Growth hormone. - Growth hormone is different actually. So that's a beautiful demonstration where growth hormone seems to be more REM sleep dependent. And that's why we can come on to the effects of alcohol and there's some really impressive frightening data on alcohol and it's disruption of sleep. But then we also know testosterone, peak levels of testosterone happen during REM sleep. - So the second half of the night, essentially. - Which is the second half of the night. So it really just means that the, your profile of mental and physical dysfunction will be different under both of those conditions. Which one would you prefer? I would prefer neither of them. And it really depends on what you're trying to optimize for. So it's just so complicated, sleep is just so pluripotent, you know, it's so physiologically systemic, that it's almost impossible not to undergo one of those two things, just deep sleep deprivation, or just REM sleep deprivation, and not show a profile that you would really prefer to avoid. And that's the reason from an evolutionary standpoint, that we've preserved those stages of sleep. I mean, sleep is just so idiotic, you know, from an evolutionary perspective. - Or maybe waking is idiotic. - Or waking is, you know, well, yeah. - Based on your previous idea. - Who've you been talking to? I think that comment is very specific to me. Yeah, I am normally always an idiot when working. But I think this idea that sleep, you know, is so profoundly detrimental to us, if you were to take it at face value, you know, you're not finding a mate, you're not reproducing, you're not foraging for food, you're not caring for you're young and worst of all, you're vulnerable to predation, on any one of those grounds sleep probably should have been selected against. But it wasn't sleep has fought its way through heroically every step along the evolutionary path. And therefore, every sleep stage has also survived as best we can tell. What that means is that those are non negotiable. If mother nature had found a way to even just sort of, you know, thin slice some of that sleep from us, there would have been vast, I'm sure evolutionary benefits, but looks as though she hasn't. And I'm usually in favor of her wisdom after 3.6 million years, so."}

Sun as naked as possible to start the day um I try to take slowly um wake up slowly and probably within an hour of that I'll leave the house and go for as long of a beachwalk as possible or if I'm in a place where there's a gym several days a week I'll go to the gym instead but some I'll do some activity I would say about an hour after waking up sometimes it's an hour and a half sometimes it's less depending on the place I'm at I also might do stretching before I go on the walk and do um just several stretches on yoga mats on the floor or uh with foam rollers or balls or some different things I don't start my day until those things are out of the way I try to avoid um any work related anything now that that said if a thought comes up that I'm excited about I'll note it I won't um avoid thoughts but I tend not to engage in any work until probably 11:00 11:00 a.m. would be the soonest and in and some days not until 1:00 and then I do focused work until maybe six and then I spend the rest of the night uh trying to wind down out of work mode so one p.m. to 6 p.m. are really the peak probably quote unquote work hours yeah could be 11: too like today we started here at 11: and that felt like I felt like I'd be good by 11: and I already did my my morning walk I had the argument on the beach I I was in the sun I was in the hot tub I had a whole whole morning already and then what does your evening wind down look like in terms of the space that you're in uh or trying to create and your internal landscape well it's only red light um I'm usually wearing from the time sun sets I'm wearing red glasses I'm in a space with only red light I'm uh 99 % of the time home with my family and we talk I might watch uh wrestling or a documentary with red glasses on um we eat dinner together or we eat dinner in shifts depending on how it's working but we're all we're all together and I find something to occupy my mind that gets me out of the workday that said sometimes the ideas still flow and I'll note them but I avoid I avoid any kind of a work phone call or um anything that's stimulating or that will get me thinking about it I aim for Sunset and then I'm usually in bed I'm usually in bed by 10: and um and fall asleep within 15 minutes your relationship to light is fascinating the sunlight piece makes a lot of sense and will make sense to the listeners of this podcast we haven't done too many episodes but we will do more that covers the trying to avoid bright light exposure in the evening um you're wearing the red uh lens glasses now even though it's the middle of the day that's because we've got these bright lights around us correct and have you found that limiting your bright artificial light exposure in the evening has benefited you and in what ways absolutely and and once you've done it once you've changed and avoid like looking at screens or my you know my phone turns red at night when I see someone else's phone if someone comes to visit and their phone lights up at night it's blinding and it's so disturbing and for them that's normal they're in this heightened blown out place all the time I'm staying at neutral I'm staying at at the the the more natural how how the world would be if man didn't create all of these uh these loud things loud loud um loud devices yeah I've switched my phone thanks to your input and we will have released a clip on this um by time this episode airs on the triple click approach to the phone that you can put in very easily um to allow it to go from regular screen to red screen at night so that you don't have to go into the settings each time you just triple click U we'll provide a link to that um explanation and Rick taught me that when I was over in Italy everyone in his home turned to me and uh said wait your phone is so bright you got to do the red light thing I said I don't know how and it taught me that so it's a very useful trick um have you no is the difference since looking at huge positive difference I sleep better there are great data now because of course I go there and find the data that um you know for shift workers people that have to be up at night working if they put them under red light the amount of cortisol at that time is suppressed which is great um as compared to when they're under bright artificial lights without red lens glasses or if they're in red lights it's far far more beneficial less cortisol you want cortisol High early in the day viewing sunlight early in the day increases it by at least 50% then you want it to taper off uh and on and on I heard something recently which is going to make a lot of sense one thing that's happened in the last 30 years which may at least partially explain the Obesity crisis is that calories which are depleted of nutrients micronutrients are very cheap now see they're very cheap to get calories but they aren't nut nutritious calories in addition there's been a change in lighting technology so that blue light photons are very cheap like when I was a kid they my parents would say turn off the lights it's costing us all this money now it's very cheap to keep the lights on in a home the heat is a different story but with respect so we have a lot of cheap photons so I think of blue light as cheap photons not the good for you photons not nourishing photons that's correct and consuming calories too often are at the wrong times of we know is bad for you consuming photons in the wrong form at the wrong time of day bad for you and I think those two things combined plus all the downstream negative Cascades can largely explain the Obesity and in some sense Mental Health crisis interesting yeah so just a there I editorialized again I realized that we're trying to shift the ratio to more Rick less Andrew but he can't help himself he can't help himself and Rick indulges me so actually"}

view of the literature on katum the scientific literature is that you know it had a lot of property similar to opioids although different as well and that it seemed kind of odd and maybe even problematic that it was so widely available and I got bombarded with um I don't want to call them katum enthusiasts because what I soon discovered was that these people um were angry with me for um placing even a partial Shadow on katum but what was interesting to me was that they were saying that in their case and I'm assuming they were telling the truth that katum had helped them get off prescription opioids and that they heavily rely on katum in various do levels of dosage um in ways that they felt really help them and so two things happened one I've been put in the crosshairs of the prrum community not not to a a severe extent but perhaps the more important thing is and I want to thank that Community uh in part for you know now it's inspired me to do a deep dive search on katum I'm going to be interviewing one of the Laboratories that's done a lot of the research on katum later in uh 2024 but also it it's made me realize like there these compounds that are available over the counter that many people feel so passionately about because they really feel like it's helped them I'm not saying it has I'm not saying it hasn't but then again I've never taken it what is katum at or perhaps what receptors does it tickle and what are your thoughts about katum and people using katum and maybe I'm pronouncing it wrong I've also heard Crome I'm calling it katum yeah uh katum is this natural substance that does have as you said opiod deric um properties as well as others that is not fully understood it's been available well naturally for many many years brought in to the United States and I've heard the same stories and I just want you to be prepared that anything I say about katum there's going to be some angry people after this and it is what it is um I have heard the same stories that you have heard about people taking katum and saying it's helping them to stay off of uh prescription opioids or illicit opioids and I get that I think in some way it's binding opioid re ctors and reducing the uh natural craving for these other substances and it makes perfect sense methadone does that buern morphine which I didn't mention before but is a is an interesting opioid that U binds to these receptors and it reduces craving um where I have challenges is in uh just because something is natural doesn't mean that it is safe we are seeing an increased number of Overdose deaths associated with katum um is it poly substance yeah in some cases it is but I think there's a lot we don't know so so poly substance people taking creatum but also alcohol uh benzos getting back to the benzos um personally uh I think we need to put a lot of research into this agent and if it merits it I think it should be a uh a prescribed substance I think part of the challenge that we have is that we don't understand the quality the Purity the dose that people are taking of this thing uh you know similar type of story with cannabis by the way uh so I'm hoping that we're going to get the research that we need to really understand what it's doing and whether it is safe and effective I'm left with a lot of unknowns right now you mentioned cannabis is cannabis effective and by extension is CBD effective for managing pain yeah there's another controversial one you'll get a few comments about whatever I say you know in general listeners of this podcast yes they tell us where they're upset they'll also tell us where they agree um are our goal here is never to um satisfy everybody but just to you know some of this lands in the in the of Highly Educated opinion um some of it is still as you pointed out speculation because we don't really know what Crum sources people are taking or cannabis Etc but um I think you'll find and my experience has been that um people appreciate that we're having the conversation and we do read all the comments and those comments often as I mentioned in my earlier anecdote about that tweet um often direct us to explore things further and we can always have a you know a second discussion about this down the line so we invite all your comments and criticism cannabis well here's what we know in carefully controlled laboratory situations cannabis has been shown to reduce neuropathic pain that's that nerve related pain from people who have either nerve injury uh diabetic neuropathy uh post-rape neuralgia terrible burning nerve pain condition it has been shown to reduce that in small samples from large larger scale epidemiology studies and even larger like Clinic based studies that I've done we find it has not been particularly helpful on average compared to people not on uh cannabis there's a lot we don't know about the causality of that and the direction of it but all to say that there are um many many questions that remain um I think the challenge that I personally have is that we're running huge population level experiments as we speak right now by you know providing unfettered use of cannabis and the bad news is is that we're probably going to see some real UNT consequences of it and we're already are um the good news is I'm hoping that at a state level we'll be able to use that data to really inform um what's going on with cannabis I mean some of the challenges are what I referred to with uh cannabis is not cannabis is not cannabis you to CBD ratios the dose yes all of that we don't know what you're getting it remains a scheduled One Drug by the DEA um I uh in some of my leadership roles and others have called for scheduling of it as a schedule to why why not to purposely try to restrict use but by making it a schedule to drug you've now made it so much easier to research uh I don't know if people understand how many barriers there are to scientists studying schedule one drugs could you explain schedule one versus schedule two thank you yeah so schedule the scheduling of drugs is a categorization that describes their abuse liability and so you have drugs like PCP heroin um cannabis which are schedule one which are defined as having high addiction potential and no uh utility which is just wild because when I think about PCP Fen cycline I certainly don't want people to run out and start taking PCP but chemically and physiologically PCP is ever so similar to ketamine and you know rarely is this discussed but ketamine is now uh widely used as a therapeutic presumably ketamine isn't scheduled to uh maybe even schedule three yes and so some of the the the stuff that's thrown into schedule one makes no sense it's historical it's all his it's decades and decades ago of history and clearly cannabis should not be a schedule one hands down no question uh by scheduling it though you will have the societal benefit of being able to make it more easy to study and then you get the NIH and the FDA into this and we can start really getting answers to the questions which I do I think it works at the end of the day do I think there is some variation of cannabis THC CBD ratios that will provide some benefit oh absolutely there's too many receptors in our brain that are involved with modulation of pain I just don't know what those are um a friend of mine uh Mark Wallace uh runs pain at UC San Diego go has come up with a really nice recipe cocktail of ratios of THC to CBD that he feels very strongly that he can help people um using that as an active agent yeah I know that in uh Colorado there's a strain of cannabis where they it's pure CBD no THC I think they call it Charlotte's Web and parents of children with intractable epilepsy will actually move to the state of Colorado in in order to get it because it seems to be effective for the treatment of certain forms of pediatric epilepsy that was shared with me with one of our colleagues Nolan Williams when he was a guest on the podcast so these plant-based compounds have have their place whether or not it's katum perhaps right we're remaining open about that or cannabis the T the THC or the CBD or some combination I think it's really interesting I think as long as we're talking about plant compounds how do you"}
{"question": "What happens when two people with strong desires for pleasure and adventure in their sex lives, but with differing goals and priorities, try to build a long-term relationship?", "doc_id": "eMqWH3LYiII_11", "video_id": "eMqWH3LYiII", "video_title": "Dr. Paul Conti: How to Build and Maintain Healthy Relationships | Huberman Lab Guest Series", "video_header": "Generative Drive in Partnerships", "segment_idx": "11", "time_start": "1:05:50", "time_end": "1:11:14", "context": ". Based on my understanding of the generative drive, the aggressive also, we're calling it proactiveness drive, and the pleasure drive, and the importance of the generative drive being greater than the aggressive or pleasure drives, I can also see the potential problem of having, like, two eights along the sexual desire scale, or two nines, or two tens. And actually, I've observed a lot of examples of this. For instance, if there are, let's say, two nines, put both people nine out of 10 on the joy and sort of proclivity for sex, adventurous sex, etc., they're very high on the pleasure scale, perhaps even so much so that they don't pay attention to, or one person doesn't pay attention to the critical need for points of compatibility to be met, like the desire to someday have a family. I've known couples like this. They're together for a long time. They seem to really enjoy one another. I know nothing of their sex lives, but there just seems to be a very strong attachment around certain forms of pleasure that they both enjoy engaging in. So this could be activities or travel. I mean, here we're saying nine out of 10 on the sex scale. But in many of those cases, there's one person saying, but I want to have a family someday, and they're just not into that. Or perhaps even like, but he won't leave his wife. They're involved in something that feels really good. They're matching along some pleasure drive, but completely overlooking the larger goals of one or both people. Right here I pointed to an instance of infidelity that's its own issues with morals, etc., but you see this a lot. People really orienting towards what feels good and who feels good to be with. And that, of course, is healthy, but that's not the entire picture. So would you say that what I'm describing is an example of where the pleasure drive has overcome the generative drive? Because in the case of somebody wanting a family and the other person already having one and being unwilling to leave that one or the other person not wanting a family, that the generative drive of the person who wants a family is not being respected or it's being undermined by this excess desire for pleasure. Like they're just drawn into the moment and the amazing weekends, but this person's incredible and they're charismatic. And I can't tell you how many times I've had friends say that they admire the person they're with, but they know the relationship can't work because of all these other underlying issues. Paul Conti: Right. It's interesting. We both overestimate and underestimate what, say, love can do. Right? People say, oh, love can do anything. No, if I spill that glass, love's not going to put the water back in it. If I must live in North America a nd my partner must live in South America, we're not going to be okay, r ight? So we say these things in a very wishful way. Love will overcome everything. It doesn't overcome that, o r maybe it does in the right circumstances. So think about if the generative drive i s very high in both people, s o both people have, say, a strong n eed to live in a certain place, t hey can find a compromise position. Maybe they live half the year in North America and half in South America. But why? Because in that situation, the love between them, which is the generative drive in the relationship. So what does that mean? The first person has to have a strong generative drive, be healthy, understand that even though I n eed to live in North America, does it actually mean that? That I really need to live in North America? I have to be able to see beyond myself, a nd what does that mean to the p erson I love who needs to live o n the other side of the world? If the other person can do that t oo, then in the relationship, which is a new entity, i t emerges from one person and the other. You can know everything about one person, everything about the other. You don't know about the two of them together. So the two of them together are an \"us\". And if that us has a strong generative drive, which it can If each person has a strong generative drive, they can bring to the state of emergence of the us the generative drive. And we're talking about a relationship, so say the love between them and they can find a way through. So the idea that love cures all things, we have to define, what does that actually mean? It doesn't mean we have a lot of pleasure together, right? Or we like a lot of the same things. That's not what that means, a nd people can very much love one another but not be aware of the limitations inside of them. Because maybe there are other things going on in them, like, say, childhood trauma. They love one another, but they can't g et out of their comfort zone enough. So the point is, if we make ourselves as healthy as we can be a nd then two selves come together that a re making themselves as healthy as they c an be, then the us between them really can fit that definition of love and do anything. But we have to define that in the right way, in a way that honors the truth, which, again, is not a higher degree of complexity. It's actually more simple. Andrew Huberman: So you gave an example of a romantic relationship where one person has a strong sex drive and the other a weaker drive."}

to quit vaping and ecigarettes and cannabis I mean um can they quit just by deciding are there programs are they all going into um you know recovery programs are there recovery programs in schools I mean how successful are they in stopping it's really difficult and and maybe I'll talk about nicotine first and the same would be true for cannabis but a little bit less extent I me both are addictive and interestingly not a lot of people realize that cannabis is addictive and about one in six teens or people who are using particularly under the age of 25 do become addicted so they don't realize that it's addictive they don't realize it's addictive the argument I often heard was it's not as bad as alcohol which is a um kind of a lame argument I understand why people default to that but I mean getting hit by a car might not be as bad as getting hit by a train um but yeah I don't I wouldn't even look at that analogy as accurate there just different um levels of destructive different types of destructive um yeah these not as bad as blank doesn't really seem to to work no no and and you know I often say people say well why' you start studying tobacco I mean there is no safe level of tobacco use period yes we have very few 30-year-olds who suddenly pick up a cigarette and become addicted you know at that point you you your development of your brain now can if you use regular Le are you still going to hurt your lungs and and heart and stuff like that absolutely the brain changes may not be there in the same way but most people don't pick up a cigarette or a cigarette for the very first time in their 30s or 40s and and on so absolutely it's addictive and and it is probably the most difficult to quit uh drug that's out there whereas alcohol we don't see I mean yes we have alcoholism I'm not downplaying that it's a huge issue in this country it's a huge issue on this planet but you're not going to have people in two weeks three weeks suddenly say I'm addicted to alcohol you are going to with nicotine and you are with cannabis to some extent as well so yes uh nicotine is incredibly addictive and we have so many teens who are addictive addicted to nicotine through ecigarettes and really struggling to get off of it I gave a talk recently to a group of parents and they said this is all great information Bonnie but how do I help my kid and I just felt awful because there's not a lot that we have so taking a few different things first of all we don't have there are some programs there are inpatient programs absolutely showing some some POS impatient program there are actually some impatient programs and but those are going to be expensive or require that people have insurance that will cover that absolutely and they take weeks and then you're taking a young person out of their natural environment out of their school out of their friends stigmatizing which hopefully we're not stigmatizing drug use anyway but you know you take a young person at 12 14 16 you put him in another place that's very difficult on them and if part of why they're using in the first place is stress you're just enhancing that outpatient programs we have some things but the problem is we don't have the best recommendations because we don't have great research so for example nicotine replacement therapy the patch first of all it's not authorized for use by the FDA something it approved by the FDA for anybody under 18 and and yet we have a lot of teenagers who are addicted we just don't have the right studies and they haven't gone to the FDA for that approval now a lot of doctors are using nicotine patches and prescribing them for somebody under 18 it's considered off label but you still can do it and most people would recommend it the the problem is and and I don't mean problem with using them I have no problem with and I've often suggested to I don't treat I I want to make sure that I'm not misquoted there either I don't directly treat see patients myself but based on the evidence and the American Academy Pediatrics recommendations we should be using a patch with those under 18 te but then the question is how much if a nicotine patch is about 21 milligrams of nicotine and a teenager is using 40 milligrams in a day do you give two patches and I've had some doctors say wow that's a lot of nicotine I say Well they're using a lot of nicotine what I've heard some uh my adolescent medicine colleagues have suggested as one patch and then supplement with gums and suckers and La Anders not as a starting I don't mean like what we're seeing with with some uh pouches out there like Zen as a starter I don't mean that I mean as a uh a form of treatment as a way to wean them off so reducing the dosage over time correct correct and and now but then they also don't have the the hand to mouth piece that we see that is difficult so gum in this case I mean non- nicotine gum just chewing regular gum um I've heard teenagers say that they're that they're withdraw last three to four minutes so they have a one teenager said I have a playlist on my phone that's each song is three to four minutes and when I start to feel the withdrawal I pop the music in my ears and I go do something and I listen to the song and by then that uncomfortable feeling is over I've heard teens say that they'll run that there's many different things that they'll do um chewing on a toothpick not a nicotine toothpick but just a toothpick um other ways to really get their mind off of that feeling is really important but we also have to know with adults and cigarettes it can take 7 to 11 tries so we can't expect until they're fully off of a cigarette can't expect a teenager to quit overnight especially with the social pressure and again sorry to interrupt but I think the the 7 to1 tries um did an episode on on nicotine and I talked about smoking a bit and most people fail most people fail they relapse it's very very difficult to quit smoking people that do it and stick to it are real heroes of the process uh it's not not easy um but that's with a heavy incentive you know immediate health issues sometimes it's Financial um Etc with kids it feels like all all the pressures are pushing in the opposite direction because it's socially rewarded they get that you know elevation of mood and focus and there's just oh so much um driving them to you know continue using absolutely right one of the things that we do in our program to help teens quit is we talk about social withdrawal and it was actually one of our we have a wonderful group of 40 youth who work with us we call our youth action board our yab our reach lab yab uh our yabs say that we need to talk about social withdrawal not just physical because of exactly what you're talking about they may not be able to go to that party at on a Saturday night where they know their friends are vaping because it'll and we know the brain cues up that they'll see or smell or or witness somebody using an ecigarette and those cues will happen and they'll want to use it so they actually have to isolate themselves from their friend group who was using so it's very difficult so really setting up your social M you really setting up your friends who are not using really trying to talk uh and and have your family around you and I really tell parents it's not the time to get pissed off with your kids for using it's the time to really help them let's be in this together and often I say the reason why they're using isn't their fault let's go back to the beginning of our conversation about marketing and and that they're being targeted and teens didn't even know what was hitting them what was going on so let's not be mad at them let's be sympathetic and help so they need the combination of nicotine replacement they needed to change their milu they need to have healthy snacks and water and and exercise and all kinds of things around them and they may also need cond behavioral therapy or some other therapy to really get them it's not going to be a one stop we need to work with them and that's the same with cannabis by the way this is just any drugs and just feel so bad it is such a problem right now when we built our curriculums same thing I said I was doing middle and high school and never thought I'd do elementary and we have an ele curriculum I thought I was only going to do prevention we now have intervention and moving towards sensation that's how many young people are just struggling right now when I was in high school there seemed to be a phenomenon of you know certain behaviors"}
{"question": "Is it possible to find a counterpoint to Donald Trump by having someone like Anthony Fauci on a podcast, despite both individuals being polarizing figures?", "doc_id": "6I5I56uVvLw_14", "video_id": "6I5I56uVvLw", "video_title": "Dr Lex Fridman: Navigating Conflict, Finding Purpose & Maintaining Drive | Huberman Lab Podcast #100", "video_header": "Donald Trump & Anthony Fauci; Ideological Extremes", "segment_idx": "14", "time_start": "1:26:10", "time_end": "1:35:08", "context": "you've seeked out or whether or not you would ever consider having Donald Trump as a guest on your podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, I've talked to Joe a lot about this and I really believe I can have a good conversation with Donald Trump, but I haven't seen many good conversations with him. So part of me thinks-- part of me believes it's possible, but he often effectively runs over the interviewer. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You could sit him down, give him an element in Athletic Greens. LEX FRIDMAN: Just relax. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That nice, cool, air conditioned black curtain studio you've got and a different side might come out. Context is powerful. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, Joe's really good at this, which is relaxing the person. Like here, have a drink. Smoke a joint, or whatever it is. But this energy of just, let's relax, and there's laughter and so on. I don't think-- as people know, I'm just not good at that kind of stuff. So I think the way I could have a good conversation with him is to really understand his worldview, be able to steel man his worldview and those that support him. Which is, I'm sorry to say for people who seem to hate Donald Trump, is a very large percentage of the country. And so you have to really empathize with those people. You have to empathize with Donald Trump, the human being, and from that perspective, ask him hard questions. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So who do you think is the counterpoint if you're going to seek balance in your guests. If you're going to have Trump on, then you have to have who on? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that's interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Anthony Fauci seems to be strongly associated with counter values, at least in the eye of the public. I think he's retiring soon, but. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, he's retiring. So that's really interesting, Anthony Fauci. Yeah, definitely, but I don't think he's a counterbalance. He's a complicated, fascinating figure who seems to have attracted a lot of hate and distrust, but also-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: And love from some people. LEX FRIDMAN: And love. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And love from some people. I mean, I know people, not even necessarily scientists, who have pro-Fauci shirts. I've seen people with anti-Fauci shirts, excuse me, certainly, but who adore him. There are people who adore him in the same way there are people that adore Trump. It's so interesting that one species of animal you get such divergent neural circuitry. LEX FRIDMAN: It almost feels like it's by design and every single topic we find tension and division is fascinating to watch. I mean, I got to really witness it from zero to a hundred in Ukraine, where there is not huge significant division. There was in certain parts of Ukraine, but across Europe, across the world there was not that much division between Russia and Ukraine, and it was just born overnight, this intense hatred. You see the same kind of stuff with Fauci over the pandemic. At first we were all huddled in uncertainty. There is a togetherness with the pandemic. Of course, there is more difficult because you're isolated. But then you start to figure out-- probably the politicians and the media try to figure out, how can I take a side here and how can I now start reporting on this side or that side and say how the other side is wrong? And so I think Anthony Fauci is a part of just being used as a scapegoat for certain things as part of that kind of narrative of division. But I think-- so Trump is a singular figure that, to me, represents something important in American history. I'm not sure what that is, but I think you have to think-- you put on your historian hat, go forward in time, and think back. How will he be remembered 20, 30, 40, 50 years from now? Who is the opposite of that? You have to-- I would really have to think about that because Trump was so singular. I think AOC is an interesting one, but she's so young it's unclear to know how-- if she represents a legitimately large scale movement or not. Bernie Sanders is an interesting option, but I wish he would be 30, 40 years younger. The young Bernie would be a good-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: There are scientists working on that. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, I think so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not him specifically, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah. Maybe him. We never know. There is a big conspiracy theory that Putin is-- that that's a body double. It's no longer him. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Bernie is Putin? LEX FRIDMAN: No, no, no, no. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm having a hard time merging that image. LEX FRIDMAN: The conspiracy theory is-- no, no, no. That the Putin we see on camera today is a body double. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, one thing that in science, and in particular, in anatomy, there's a classification scheme for different types of anatomists, which they either say you're a lumper or a splitter. Some people like to call a whole structure something, not necessarily just for simplicity but for a lot of reasons. And then other people like to microdivide the nucleus into multiple names. And of course, people used to be able to name different brain structures after themselves. So that would be the nucleus of Lex and the Huberman vesiculus or whatever. Less of that nowadays. And by the way, those structures don't actually exist just yet. We haven't defined those yet. I was making those names up. But what's interesting is it seems like in the last five years, there's been a lot of trend-- there's been a trend, excuse me, toward a requirement for lumping. You can't say-- it seems that it's not allowed, if you will, to say, hey, yeah, you know-- and here I'm not stating my-- I will never reveal my preferences about pandemic related things for hopefully obvious reasons. Some people will say vaccines, yes, but masks, no. Or vaccines and masks, yes, but let people work. And other people will say, no, everyone stay home. And then other people will say, no, no vaccines, no masks. Let everybody work. No one was saying no vaccines, no masks, and stay home, I don't think. So there's this sort of lumping, right? The boundaries around ideology really did start to defy science. I mean, it wasn't scientific. It was one part science-ish at times and sometimes really hardcore science. Other times it was politics, economics. I mean, we really saw the confluence of all these different domains of society that use very different criteria to evaluate the world. I mean, as a scientist, I remember when the vaccines first came out and I asked somebody, one of the early concerns I had that was actually satisfied for me was, how does this thing turn off? If you start generating mRNA, how does it actually get turned off? So I asked a friend, they know a lot about RNA biology. And I said, you know, how does it turn off? They explained it to me and I was like, OK, makes sense. I asked some other questions. But most people aren't going to think about it at that level of detail necessarily, but it did seem that there was just kind of amorphous blobs of ideology that they grabbed on to things and then there was this need for a chasm between them. It was almost felt like it became illegal, in some ways, to want two of the things from that menu and one of the things from that menu. I really felt like I was being constrained by a kind of like Bento box model where I didn't get to define what was in the Bento box. I could either have Bento box A or Bento box Z, but nothing in between. LEX FRIDMAN: And I think on that topic and I think a lot of topics, most people are in the middle with humility, uncertainty, and they're just kind of trying to figure it out. And I think there is just the extremes defining the nature of this division. So I think it's the role of a lot of us in our individual lives, and also if you have a platform of any kind, I think you have to try to walk in the middle with the empathy and humility. And that's actually what science is about is the humility. I'm still thinking about who's the opposite of Trump. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, maybe there is none. I mean, maybe Fauci is orthogonal to Trump. I mean, not everything has an opposite. I mean, maybe he's an n of 1 maybe he's in the minority of one because he was an outsider from Washington who then made it there. LEX FRIDMAN: But also I wonder-- you have to pick your battles because every battle you fight you should take very seriously. And just the amount of hate I get, I got, and I still get for having sat down"}

And if you could perhaps tell me a little bit also about the Brazilian prisoner study. - Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Ayahuasca is another psychedelic. It's used as a sacrament in Brazil and in Peru and Ecuador, in Columbia. So a lot of the South American countries. And what they do is they combine two plants together, where one plant of the two plant combination would effectively do nothing, but the two plant combination together is capable of producing this very profound psychedelic effect. And what's really kind of curious is that there are, as I understand it, 10 to 20,000 plant species in the Amazon. And somehow, somebody- - Someone tried 'em all. - Combined these two plants together in certain proportionality and cooked this for five, 10 hours to the point where you cook out the dimethyltryptamine out of one of the plants and cook out the reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor out of the other plant in such a way that the reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor prevents the GI breakdown of the dimethyltryptamine in such a way that it's then allowed to cross the blood-brain barrier and get into the brain. And if you didn't add the reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor plant derived into this combination, then it would never cross the brain. If you put people on a standard, psychiatry prescribed monoamine oxidase inhibitor that wasn't reversible, you'd throw them into serotonin syndrome, right? So this kind of like sweet spot that somehow ayahuasca practitioners have found of being able to get DMT into the brain from an oral source with this combination of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor is curious. And so that substance has been explored as an antidepressant agent, and some studies have looked at that. It also seems to be very safe. There's a psychiatrist down at UCLA Harbor who's done a lot of work with this, where he's looked at children even that have been exposed to kind of small doses of ayahuasca as kind of a sacrament within Amazonian tribes and found no neurocognitive effects, no neurocognitive effects in adults. And so it appears to be safe. It's kind of part and brought into various religions, including kind of merged with Catholicism in South America, which is kind of very interesting. And so, you know, in some sects of Catholicism in Brazil, it's used as a sacrament during religious ceremonies. And so it became interesting to Brazilian researchers as to whether or not they could affect recidivism rates for prisoners in Brazilian prisons, right? So they gave half of the prisoners, you know, some sort of inert substance and half of the prisoners an ayahuasca session. And the recidivism rate or the return to prison rate in the ayahuasca exposed individuals was statistically significantly lower than the recidivism rate in the control group, suggesting that, you know, whatever is going on there seems to have an effect on whatever drives criminal behavior, whatever criminal behavior that happened to be. And I don't have the details on the exact nature of the crime. You know, I am also in no way saying that we should just be giving psychedelics to folks in prison and all of that. I think that that is a very edgy thing to do and probably not something that anybody should try, but it does kind of bring up this curious question of what is it about that that would drive people to change those behaviors and why do people make those behavioral decisions? And a lot of times if you look at prisons in the United States, you know, people say this, what's the biggest mental health facility in the United States? It's a prison. - Yeah, there's a lot to unpack there for sure. You know, the homeless issue, the prison issue."}
{"question": "What are the key differences between a growth mindset and a fixed mindset, and how does the \"stress-is-enhancing mindset\" concept relate to these two mindsets?", "doc_id": "aQDOU3hPci0_13", "video_id": "aQDOU3hPci0", "video_title": "How to Enhance Performance & Learning by Applying a Growth Mindset", "video_header": "Stress-is-Enhancing Mindset", "segment_idx": "13", "time_start": "55:32", "time_end": "1:05:51", "context": "understand what growth mindset is and what differentiates it from a fixed mindset however just understanding what growth mindset is and how having a desire to implement it and a bit of understanding of how to implement it turns out to be necessary but not sufficient there's an additional piece that we need to accomplish the good news is that additional piece is very straightforward to understand if we zoom out and we start to really understand that growth mindset is really a way of connecting motivation to cognition it's taking this thing that we call motivation which is of course what we all want we all want to be motivated we all want to be effort driven Etc and we take motivation and we tie it to a set of specific thoughts or thought processes that we can control that is Far and Away different than looking at motivation simply as an emotional or an internal state of quote unquote feeling motivated and in fact that's what most people including myself default to we want to feel motivated so fortunately we try and get good sleep which is essential that really helps for daytime mood focus and alertness and thereby motivation we hydrate we exercise we might even drink caffeine as a way to increase our level of alertness and motivation and all of that is finding good in fact all of that is encouraged although I would say that the caffeine part is optional but all those other things are encouraged toward mental health physical health and performance and motivation but what growth mindset is really about is it's taking this thing that we call motivation and it's saying okay what are the specific types of thoughts and actually the specific thoughts the specific cognitive processes that will allow us to feel more motivated especially under conditions where we feel something is hard where we are not getting the results we want and in order to master that process we need to embrace another mindset that's right in order to access growth mindset it's very clear that we need to be able to think about errors and we need to overcome errors and we need to devote our attention to errors and we need to devote our attention to reframing what's going on in our head when we're feeling not motivated Etc and all of that is really hard to do from a purely psychological standpoint but there's this additional mindset which has to do with our mindset around stress and frustration itself that can allow us to access growth mindset far more easily and this mindset around stress actually has a name it's called the stress is enhancing mindset and there's a very straightforward way to increase your stress is enhancing mindset so first I want to step back and acknowledge the person who really made some of the key fundamental discoveries in this area that we call stresses enhancing mindsets and that's Dr Alia sometimes referred to as Dr Ali Crum she's a tenured professor of psychology at Stanford she also is a former division one athlete and a licensed clinical psychologist she's an absolute Phenom and I promise you that she is so successful in all those categories by way of immense amounts of effort in addition to that she also happens to be an incredibly kind person and generous person she was a guest on this podcast previously you can find that episode in the show note captions or by going to hubermanlab.com and simply searching for mindset crumb c-r-u-m her personal story and her work and the tool she offers are absolutely spectacular however you don't need to go to that episode just yet I'm going to talk about some of those tools now and I'm going to talk about how using those tools can allow you to access growth mindset and then I'm going to talk about how the combination of applying a stress is enhancing mindset with a growth mindset acts synergistically to even further improve performance in the short and long run the stresses enhancing mindset is the outgrowth of many different studies and not just from Dr Ali Crum but from others as well but for the time being I want to focus on one paper in which Dr Crum was the first author so this work was done before she arrived at Stanford the paper is entitled rethinking stress the role of mindsets in determining the stress response and the key takeaway from this paper is that how we think about stress impacts how we react to stress so much so in fact that what this paper illustrates is that if people are given even just a short tutorial about some of the negative consequences of stress on learning and performance and their physiology and their health they experience a lot of negative consequences of stress when they are put into a stressful circumstance conversely if people are taught about the performance enhancing aspects of stress then those people will experience performance enhancement when they are confronted with stress in a learning or other performance type environment so what we are talking about here is not the placebo effect I want to be very clear about that we are also not talking about lying to people in order to shift their response to stress what we're talking about here is two different conditions one condition where people are exposed to information that is true about how stress can diminish performance and another condition in which people are exposed to information that is also true about how stress can enhance performance now you might be saying how can it be true that stress is both performance diminishing and stress is performance enhancing and ah therein lies the key takeaway from this paper it depends on what you believe about stress in fact a different way to umbrella this whole discussion is to say that how you think about stress impacts the stress response in profound ways so this paper rethinking stress the role of mindsets and determining stress did a very simple set of manipulations they had people in one group listen to a lecture that effectively was titled quote the effects of stress are negative and should be avoided and that lecture included information about how stress diminishes performance and how it can diminish health and vitality learning and performance productivity it increases uncertainty Etc okay and all of that information is true a separate group listened to a lecture entitled quote experiencing stress improves health and vitality and again that information is true now I realize that some of you are probably still asking how can it be that stress diminishes health and performance and stress also enhances health and performance and the answer lies in two things one the level of stress and therefore the level of hormones that are released in response to that stress the duration over which the stress response occurs but the key variable here is that our cognitive understanding about what stress does impacts whether or not our physiology goes down the direction of debilitating or enhancing effects of stress Okay so we've got a condition here where people are being informed very differently about what stress does in one case it's the stresses bad message in the other case it's the stress is good message and there are many different experiments within this paper but one of the more interesting ones I believe is where they looked at work performance both in terms of performance of what they call soft tasks so these are somewhat easier tasks as well as hard tasks and when you look at the group that was given information about how stress diminishes performance in the soft tasks okay so the somewhat easy task You Don't See Much change in their performance as you compare the before the learning about stress is diminishing to after the learning whereas the people who learn that stress is enhancing actually experience some improvement in work performance even though the challenge that they're facing isn't that great so again what this means is that learning that stress can enhance performance by providing people true information about how stress can enhance performance can increase performance even in the context of stuff that's not that hard not that stressful even more interesting is that when you look at performance on tasks that are considered hard and you compare the stresses diminishing group meaning the group that was taught that stress is diminishing and compare that to the stresses enhancing group you see a really Divergent response the people that learn that stress diminishes performance did not improve at all whereas the people that learn that stress can enhance performance enhance their performance significantly now keep in mind all they are doing is learning that stress can enhance their performance and then they're given the task and they're performing better so that's pretty spectacular right there's no training session that they went and did they didn't practice these items that they were being tested on in between they weren't given a bunch of you know drills to do and they didn't take a lot of time to do it they just heard a tutorial about how stress can enhance performance and that I believe is remarkable because what it says is that our cognitive appraisal about stress which we all are going to experience in life right elevated heart rate narrowing a visual Focus you know shifting of blood away from the periphery all of these things are characteristic features of the stress response that we learn especially in this day and age because it's talked about a lot in popular culture that oh you know all of the these mechanisms were put into us in order for us to get away from the saber-toothed tiger or the or the line that's trying to eat us let's be fair the stress response is there for a lot of reasons not just because of saber-toothed tigers and lions I mean that's kind of a story that we make up the stress response is inherent not just to us but to other species as a way to mobilize us either away from things or toward things right we need to have somewhat of a stress response in order to engage in adaptive challenge yes it's true that hundreds and thousands of years ago those adaptive challenges probably involved hunting but they probably involved Social Challenges as well do you think it was you know easy for cavemen and women to engage socially and you know kind of settle out their romantic interactions Etc do you think it was easy for them to raise children no of course not the stress response is there for a variety of reasons not just to get away from predators the really exciting thing that's been discovered in the course of Ali krum's work and other work in the last couple of decades is that the stress response is neither good nor bad the stress response depends on whether or not you believe the sensations that you're experiencing elevated heart rate narrowing a visual Focus Etc are serving to enhance your performance or diminish your performance and this study really points to the fact that just learning that it can enhance performance can enhance performance now I know a number of you are probably saying wait but stress doesn't feel good right and"}

the transition zone of of having versus losing their fertility I mean these are like yeah and those change all sorts of these pressures are so real and yet if we only have one system in the brain that handles this similarly to the reward system it seems like we ought to learn in school how to uh like um work with and update our decision-making process based on immediate term shortterm like all the different time scales to be able to do that seems really important um are there any ways to train that up yeah I think it's a so so there's a few things in in here that um I think are are worth unpacking um I mean one is what you brought up about fatigue which I think is um really critical and we we did some work with the wrestling team at Penn um coach came to us and I I had had a few of the wrestlers working in my lab and he said you know we're having this problem which is that um and I don't know if you've ever wrestled I wrestled my my middle son in one match the worst six minutes well I didn't quit because I lost that match and I did lose that match this seventh grade I quit because uh my dad gave me a choice I could either continue to wrestle yeah or I could play this other sport I really wanted to play he said you can't do both yeah because it was gonna impact my grades negatively and so I opted for the other sport what was the other sport soccer okay yeah okay and just yeah and I I love soccer um and um but you know losing that one wrestling match was informative the guy just dead fished on me the whole time and he deserved a win like it was a really good strategy he just like dead fished on me uh you know and I I like couldn't couldn't Gumby out of there but it is the worst six minutes of your life you're you're exhausted Within like 30 seconds it's it's incredibly grueling and what uh what the coach observed was that um their guys it was the men's wrestling team was they were performing very well in the first two periods and they got to the third period and they started making really dumb mistakes bad decisions and so we so he said what's going on I said well it's about this speed accuracy trade-off but we have to investigate how it's related to fatigue so uh what we did this was a really fun experiment so we go to the wrestling room and uh we wire these guys up they got wearable EG heart rate monitors the whole nine yards and what we do we gave them like this simple little um decision-making impulse control task it's just like a controll response task there's a you know a trade-off if you go too fast and you make mistakes okay so it's like there's it's like a go no go and uh so they do it then we run them through two minutes of CrossFit exercises really brutal then they come back off and they have to do the same thing again we do that three times and then they have to wrestle each other so it's cognitive and physical yeah not on like chess boxing which is not a sport I recommend have you seen this where they play around they play some chess and then they literally fight and then they it's crazy it's like switching between these two very different states of it's insane but also somehow really appealing you know it's well I think for the neuroscientist in you and me and I think we're all neuroscientists to some extent we want to understand the brain and ourselves so this notion of very disperate um behaviors boxing and playing chess being associated with very disparate sort types of arousal mhm and um and how those map on to one another I think is interesting I think the uh the the Confluence of uh chess boxing is fencing uh which is very much like chess my my youngest son fenced for a number of years and so mentally it's like that but it has the physicality or jiujitsu my friend JSU Brazil you tell me that it's like there's an infinite number of options that become constrained in certain yeah Dynamics and you yeah yeah yeah very similar so this this was really cool because what we found was that uh speed accuracy trade-off the more fatigue they got the more calories they spent um the faster they would slide down to emphasizing speed over accuracy they just started like just like just going just got to get done just got to get I don't know what they're feeling but that they were just not deliberating not really being focused they just lost the capability uh of doing that and aside from the you can say well we could help you guys you you could become more physically fit maybe when fatigue is fast but they're about as fit as they could be they said well why don't we do this why don't we offload the decision in the third period to the coach as soon as you in the third period you're going to just look at the coach um uh at at you know some Cadence or whenever he's going to yell at you to look and you do what the coach tells you so and I think this is really interesting because you think about it in like other contexts like in a business context or something when if somebody's really fatigued or your unit's fatigued maybe you have an external person then who takes over uh making the decision that you are just um you just execute in a sense right um the other thing I want to say about this all too which I it gets to your point about well in the lab it's like you know it's one thing you're you're you're you got an undergraduate gambling for 10 bucks over an hour and that's how do how well does that map on to the real world where there are all these other things going on and I think that um that's the challenge all the you know when I teach business school or you know classes MBA students or Executives through exec Ed they all want to know like give me the fstep formula you know and it's like that's supposed to apply how do I take into all and it's like well we mostly know about one this Dimension or that Dimension or that Dimension and not how in the real world you know on a real complex environment to put that all together so that is a I think that's a gap that's a and one that we're trying to fill which is to study decision- making whether it's individual or Collective decision- making in real world environments right to where all of these um factors you know context and the various priorities that are coming in uh are more you know more natural they're not controlled and how then I mean we think we know how that works but we haven't really proven

everyone's like Pro vitamin D it's really interesting somehow vitamin D people are comfortable taking a gel a vitamin D gel cap but like other supplements where you say oh like maybe um this might be good for uh you know like Omega-3s and fish them people are a little bit like more standoffish it's really interesting that the kind of PS social stuff around this how much vitamin D do you personally take I take 5,000 units a day okay so do I vitamin D is complicated though here's the problem if you look at the literature vitamin D deficiency is associated with all these chronic metabolic diseases however supplementation with vitamin D has not fixed any of those so if you're vitamin D deficient why wouldn't some supplementation fix it couple of reasons one one of the reasons for vitamin D deficiency is because everyone's drinking soft drinks that's one reason but there's a more important reason uh sugar and artificially sweetened soft drinks yeah can deplete vitamin D utiliz well you're not consuming Dairy because you're consuming soft drinks but I can't tolerate milk anymore well and you take vitamin D but here's the here's the real nugget of Truth and this is a little complicated but the endocrinologists and the audience will get it vitamin D is a pre-pro hormone it's not it's not active at all vitamin D is converted in the liver first step to a compound called 25 hydroxy vitamin D that is a pro hormone it also is inactive it has no activity whatsoever from there 25 hydroxy vitamin D can be metabolized one of two ways it can either be one alpha hydroxylated in the kidney to the active form one alpha one uh 25 dihydroxy vitamin D which will then do all of the business of vitamin D such as calcium absorption from the gut suppression of the immune system at the toll like receptor 4 that sounds like a bad thing no that's a good thing I know but I had to bring that up because when you say suppression immune system people go I'm immunosuppressed nobody that sounds like AIDS a good it suppresses inflammation got it it's a good thing okay suppression of inflamation and that's actually the point that we're we're getting to so there are a lot of good things about 125 dihydroxy vitamin D however that 25 hydroxy D that came out of the liver can be metabolized a different way it can be 24 hydroxy in in inflammatory tissue like tuberculosis sarcoid gut inflammation and so you will end up taking your 25 hydroxy D which is a pro hormone and turning it into the inactive 2425 dihydroxy D which then just gets excreted out so in other words you consumed all this vitamin D and it didn't go where you needed it to go and the reason was because you're inflamed you you have to fix the inflammation before the vitamin D can be effective and 93% of Americans are inflamed so giving them vitamin D is not going to do a damn thing got it is"}
{"question": "Can caffeine, a substance that is naturally present in some plants and added to many foods and beverages, serve as a reinforcing agent in the way that it affects our behavior, and if so, how does it work?", "doc_id": "iw97uvIge7c_6", "video_id": "iw97uvIge7c", "video_title": "Using Caffeine to Optimize Mental & Physical Performance | Huberman Lab Podcast 101", "video_header": "Caffeine as a Reinforcing Agent", "segment_idx": "6", "time_start": "30:00", "time_end": "36:45", "context": "in this study on honeybees where the bees prefer nectars that contain caffeine. And that all makes perfect sense in terms of the ecology of bees and flowers that contain nectar. There's an advantage, at least in terms of adaptation, that the flower benefits because of distribution of things from the flower, which is good for the flowers and the bees benefit, because they're getting food. And so there's a kind of a symbiosis there. But with humans, we're consuming caffeine-containing beverages for our sake. I don't think we have it in mind, nor do the bees have it in mind, frankly, that we're trying to preserve the plants that provide the caffeine. I think we would all suffer, or I should say 90% of adults would suffer greatly if all the caffeine-containing coffee and tea plants were gone, certainly. But most of us are not consuming coffees and teas and caffeine-containing foods because we're thinking about the plants they come from and we want to help those plants. We're thinking about how we want to help ourselves. And yet the point of the reinforcing effects of caffeine are that they are largely subconscious. We are not aware of them. Now you might say, no, that's not true. When I drink caffeine, it makes me feel really good. So I'm aware that it makes me feel good. In order to illustrate how reinforcement really works, let me give you the counter example, which would be an aversive agent. So we have reinforcing agents and we have aversive agents. Let's say that there were compounds in nature that exist in plants that are aversive. And indeed, they are. And let's say that these compounds were present at such low concentrations that you couldn't taste them. Let's say you wake up in the morning and you go to your refrigerator and you open it up and you are thirsty, and so you reach for a nice rich red-containing beverage in a glass jar. Maybe it looks like cranberry juice or something of that sort. Or even a nice clear glass of water. It looks like a jug of water or a glass of water, and you drink that. Taste fine to you. Maybe even tastes great to you. And then let's say about 30 minutes later, you feel a little queasy, you feel a little off, you feel like going back to sleep, you just don't feel very good. You don't know why, but your nervous system is a predictive machine, and it has a process in which it back integrates. Or I should say integrates backwards into your immediate experience that preceded that not so good feeling. We can reliably say that there is a much lower probability that the next day when you wake up that you would reach for that same beverage or for that same container even. And maybe if you're in a novel environment, maybe you're staying in an Airbnb or a hotel or something of that sort, you might even find that you don't really like the kitchen in which you consume that beverage in the first place. And you don't know why. And unless you got very, very sick the day before, it's unlikely that you would have such a strong response that you would entirely avoid, for instance, water or glass jars containing liquids, et cetera. Let's say you went back to the refrigerator and you consume a beverage again and you just didn't feel so well, you felt less good than you normally would. Well, even without any ability to taste what's in that beverage and even without any understanding of what was happening to you at a conscious level, there is a very, very high probability that you will avoid drinking that particular beverage and certainly at that location and in the same volume in the subsequent days. That's just the way that aversive agents work. And they work by way of activating neurons in the gut that communicate with areas in the brain that give us this feeling of queasiness. And for some of you hearing this, that pathway and that association with times in which you felt queasy and as if you wanted to vomit is so powerful that you might even be feeling some of that symptomology now. For certain people that's going to be increased salivation which precedes vomiting, we know that there's a class of neurons in the brain relate to an area called area postrema that actually stimulates vomiting. And if I keep talking about this, I'll probably feel like I want to vomit, so I'm going to move on from this in a moment. So when we ingest caffeine-containing beverages and foods, it's the exact opposite scenario as to what I just described. Caffeine, as a reinforcer, makes us feel slightly better or a lot better in the immediate minutes and hours after we ingest it. So it's acting as a reinforcing agent not just while you are under the effects of caffeine but for the things that preceded the ingestion of caffeine, which is why you return again and again to caffeine-containing beverages, such as coffee and tea or maybe even foods that contain caffeine, even if the taste of those foods is not something that you would otherwise consider, especially delicious. In fact, most people when they take their first sip of coffee or tea or other caffeine-containing beverage, they find it to be very bitter. And that's not because of the taste of caffeine. It's because of the taste of the beverage itself independent of caffeine. However, when caffeine is present in there, they come to prefer that taste over most all tastes. In fact, they will, as I mentioned earlier, will invest a lot of financial resources and time and energy to make sure that they get that beverage. What they're trying to make sure is not that they get that taste but that they get the caffeine. It is that positively reinforcing. And the taste therefore takes on new significance, new meaning, and we come to associate it as positive. And in fact, most of us, including myself, love the taste of espresso, love the taste of coffee, love the taste of yerba maté even if the initial taste, the very first time that we consume that beverage, was either neutral or negative. And that is all because of the reinforcing properties of caffeine. And then, of course, there are the more direct actions of caffeine. That is, the faster actions of caffeine. And just to list those off again very briefly so that you have them in mind going forward, caffeine also increases the release of dopamine and acetylcholine, both of which are neuromodulators in the forebrain, which increases clarity of thought and your ability to rule switch, your ability to move from one context to another and change and understand the rules of engagement, social engagement, physical engagement, mental engagement, and so forth. And as I mentioned before, caffeine also increases the number of dopamine receptors in the reward pathway, such that any good thing that happens to you. Any positive experience that you have will have a more potent effect on your feelings of well-being. And last but certainly not least, caffeine acts as an adenosine antagonist. It reduces your feelings of lethargy and fatigue and your desire to sleep by parking in the receptors for adenosine and not allowing adenosine to have its pro-sleepy, if you will, effects on your brain and body. I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens."}
{"question": "Is the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex the specific area of the brain that controls the connection between the heart and the rest of the body through the vagus nerve?", "doc_id": "X4QE6t-MkYE_5", "video_id": "X4QE6t-MkYE", "video_title": "Dr. Nolan Williams: Psychedelics & Neurostimulation for Brain Rewiring | Huberman Lab Podcast #93", "video_header": "The Brain-Heart Connection, Vagus Nerve, Prefrontal Cortex", "segment_idx": "5", "time_start": "15:16", "time_end": "17:48", "context": "that the brain and the heart are connected, but you described, I believe, a direct relationship between areas of the brain associated with emotion and heart rate. - Yes. - And that makes perfect logical sense to me. But I think at the same time, many people out there probably think of the relationship between the heart and the mind as kind of woo or kind of a soft biology. But here you're talking about an actual physical connection. - Yep. - Between, what area of the brain is it? - The first place where the stimulation goes is called the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. It's kind of the sense of control, kind of governor of the brain. And then what we know is that when you use a magnet, use kind of what we call Faraday's Law, this idea of using a magnetic pulse to induce an electrical current and electrically conducting substances. So in this case, brain tissue, but not skull or scalp or any of that, or hair. You avoid all that, just the brain tissue. Then you have a direct depolarization of cortical neurons, you know, the surface of the brain's neurons, in this dorsolateral prefrontal. And if you do that in the actual scanner, which we can do, you can see that that distributes down into the anterior cingulate and the insula and the amygdala. And ultimately the tract goes into something called the nucleus tractus solitarius and ultimately into the vagus nerve into the heart. So the heart very consistently seems to be the end organ of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. If you measure heart rate in standard ways that cardiologists measure heart rate and you stimulate over this left dorsolateral, you get a deceleration of the heart rate and it's very time locked to the stimulation. So it's a two second train of stimulation. At one second, you see the deceleration, it goes down about 10 beats per minute, and then it'll drift back up and there's a break for eight seconds on the stimulation. Drifts back up and the stimulation goes back in and then the heart rate goes back down. And so you see the heart rate just do this, 10 beats per minute every train. And so we know, and if you do that over visual cortex, you don't get that, or motor cortex, you don't get any of those findings. It's really specific to this kind of control region of the brain. And so, yeah, it seems to, you know, it's our work, other folks' work. Martin Arens in Europe, the Netherlands, work showing the same connections. I think it's been replicated like four or five times. - So you mentioned left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex."}
{"question": "What is Guevedoces, a rare condition where a baby born with little to no external male genitalia grows a penis around age 12 due to a genetic mutation affecting the production of dihydrotestosterone?", "doc_id": "J7SrAEacyf8_14", "video_id": "J7SrAEacyf8", "video_title": "Biological Influences On Sex, Sex Differences & Preferences", "video_header": "Penis Sprouting: Guevedoces", "segment_idx": "14", "time_start": "27:46", "time_end": "31:19", "context": "for which now there's a wealth of scientific data. And this relates to a genetic mutation, where 5-alpha-reductase the enzyme that converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone doesn't exist. It's mutated in a way into a genome that it doesn't exist. And this actually was first identified in the Dominican Republic. It has shown up elsewhere. It's quite rare, but where it shows up it's robust. What happens is baby is born. Typically when a baby is born they don't measure chromosomes. They don't look at chromosomal sex XX or XY. That's not typically done nowadays. Baby is born. If you were to look at that baby, it would look female. There would be very little or no external penis. And so people would say, \"It's a girl.\" And they might, you know, have the celebration it's a girl. And I guess now they call them \"Gender Reveal Parties\" or something like that. I don't know about this, but anyway. They would reveal. The baby would reveal its external genitalia simply by being there and being naked when it's born. It has nothing to do with gender, it has to do with genitalia and sex. That baby would be born. And what was observed is that, from time to time, that baby after being raised as a girl, perfectly happy as a girl would around the age of 11 or 12 or 13, would suddenly start to sprout a penis. There's actually a name for this, it's called Guevedoces. Which the translation is more or less, penis at 12. And as strange as this might sound, it makes sense if you understand the underlying mutation. What happens in these children, these Guevedoces, is that the child is born. It has testes which are not descended, so up in the body. They're not making a lot of testosterone early on. They weren't able to convert testosterone to dihydrotestosterone because they lack this enzyme 5-alpha-reductase. As a consequence, the primary sexual characteristic of external male genitalia, penis, doesn't develop. And then what happens is the baby grows up as a young child essentially is treated as a girl. Generally they report being pretty comfortable as girls, although not always. And then testosterone starts getting secreted from the testes 'cause kisspeptin in the brain signals through gonadotropin and luteinizing hormone and travels down to the testes, the testes start churning out testosterone and there's a secondary growth of the penis. And all of a sudden there's a penis. And this leads to some very complicated situations in families and culturally. And actually the outcomes in terms of whether or not these children decide to self identify as males or females and how people treat them actually varies quite a lot. There's actually been kind of an adopting of a third category of sex and gender in these Guevedoces for in order to just offer them the opportunity to explore not just what would be a typical kind of girl or woman or boy or man phenotype, but something in between. Something that some people call intersex although intersex and pseudo hermaphroditism is actually a separate thing altogether. So it's fascinating and the point here is that dihydrotestosterone not testosterone is responsible for this primary growth of the penis. And that testosterone later is involved in the secondary sexual characteristics deepening in the voice, et cetera. Now this is where the information"}

{"question": "What are some effective ways to boost dopamine levels without over-stimulating the brain, especially when trying to engage in divergent thinking and creative activities?", "doc_id": "KPlJcD-o-4Q_13", "video_id": "KPlJcD-o-4Q", "video_title": "The Science of Creativity & How to Enhance Creative Innovation | Huberman Lab Podcast 103", "video_header": "Tool: Mood Calibrating, Caffeine & Dopamine", "segment_idx": "13", "time_start": "1:16:00", "time_end": "1:23:39", "context": "Well, that, of course, creates a conundrum. How do you know how much dopamine you need and how to achieve those elevated levels of dopamine. Well, leaving aside people who are suffering from a manic episode what Chermahini and Hommel have discovered is that if people are in a low mood, they're not feeling great, maybe they're depressed but they're just not feeling that great. They feel on a scale of 1 to 10, around a 2, or a 3, maybe a 4. The probability that they will be able to engage effectively in divergent thinking is quite low. However, the good news is, they are typically very susceptible to elevations in mood through observing or hearing positive stories, listening to music that they like, any kind of so-called inspirational stimuli. Now, this is good news. What this means is that if you're somebody who's not feeling very motivated to engage in divergent thinking, you're not feeling very creative, you're feeling a little low. The thing to do in that case is actually to take external stimuli. Things that you like and start interacting with those stimuli to get your mood elevated and then to engage in divergent thinking. However, what Chermahini and Hommel have also shown is that if people are already in a very good mood, elevating dopamine further is not conducive. And in fact, is detrimental to divergent thinking. And in that case, they would be better off for example, not engaging in any activities or taking anything in the way of pharmacology that would further increase their dopamine. And probably limiting the amount of external stimuli that are coming in through music and visual stimuli and really focusing on divergent thinking and the creative process immediately. Now, this is important. In an earlier episode both on bipolar and on other forms of depression, I talked about how rates of bipolar manic episodes and dopamine levels and creativity tend to be correlated. Now, unfortunately, rates of suicide are 20 to 30 times higher in people who have bipolar disorder as well. And so there's a whole dark side to the bipolar disorder that makes it a very, very dangerous and important disorder to treat. But for sake of the discussion of creativity, what this means is that we all need to develop some intuitive sense as to whether or not our mood is-- suppose we could spin this into three categories is kind of-- yes, happy, excited, positive mood, and, of course, there are going to be levels to that. Low like, mmmh, or meh in the middle. So if you're in a low mood or meh mood, by all means engage in something probably for about 5 to 30 minutes that elevates your mood before trying to engage in divergent thinking. However, if you happen to be in a pretty positive mood, even if you're not 10 out of 10 on mood, then bringing in additional stimuli to increase your levels of dopamine will not help you and in fact can hurt the divergent thinking process. So in that case, I would also encourage you to think about something that was discussed on a previous episode, which is the particular effects of caffeine. I'll get into caffeine a little bit later. But just very briefly, caffeine increases levels of dopamine receptors. So it's not the caffeine is bad. In fact, caffeine can be neuroprotective, it can enhance focus and so forth. But divergent thinking is anti focus. It requires just enough focus to be able to come up with new ideas. But you actually don't want to be overly focused. Focus is more conducive to convergent thinking. In fact, that's exactly what the literature shows, is that caffeine because its effects on epinephrine and related systems in the brain like adenosine. But mainly because of its effects on persistence and focus is very conducive to convergent thinking. So if you're somebody who wants to explore creativity and wants to get better at creativity, you now know that you need to engage in divergent thinking and then afterwards convergent thinking. I would recommend not using stimulants such as caffeine prior to divergent thinking but rather use stimulants if you do want to use stimulants such as caffeine prior to convergent thinking. And in fact, in formulating the architecture of today's episode, which took me many hours across many different days I confess, I actually decided to try this. In trying to imagine the different configurations and ways that this information can be organized, I deliberately abstained from caffeine during those bouts of work. And when structuring everything according to the decisions I had already made, I purposely ingested caffeine prior to that. Now, of course, constructing a podcast episode is not really the ultimate example of a creative act because, of course, it's taking existing information. It's arranging in a novel ways. But it doesn't necessarily allow key concepts to pop out in the way that, for instance, Banksy or a Rothko or an Escher would pop out. I'm certainly not naive in thinking that it does. But the principle of is what's important here. You need divergent thinking. You need convergent thinking. You need some level of elevated dopamine in order to engage in divergent thinking. But not so high that it starts to inhibit that process. Now, if you were to come into the laboratory, this could be measured by your frequency of blinking. For better or for worse, we can't actually count the number of times that we blink unless we're actively paying attention to it. So I don't recommend that you pay attention to your blinking because that will take you off course from all the other important things of your life. And how many times you're blinking is rarely an important thing for you to pay attention to. You can however, learn to calibrate your mood that is, to assess your mood whether or not you're in low, medium, or high mood. No problem using that broad binning. You could scale it on 1 to 10. And then decide whether or not you're going to use some dopamine elevating stimulus from the outside. Again, could be music, could be exercise, is an excellent way to elevate dopamine. I'll talk about another well-established one from the research literature that is known to elevate dopamine by 65% in the particular pathway that's relevant for divergent thinking and to do that without any pharmacology. I'll share that with you in a moment. But you need to decide for you in a given moment or in a given work attempt at creativity what you need and apply accordingly. Because as Chermahini and Hommel have shown, whether or not you are in a low mood, medium mood, or high mood, really can determine whether or not you'll be able to access divergent thinking or not. Now, if you're somebody who already has an idea in mind, you're very excited about a creative idea and you want to hone it, you want to shape it, you want to pressure test it. We'll talk a little bit more about what that means in a three step process in just a little bit. I would strongly encourage you to look at that process is a very linear process in which there are right and wrong answers. And there, the use of caffeine at appropriate dosages and dosages for caffeine that are safe and in fact, performance enhancing were covered in the episode on caffeine turns out it's 1 to 3 milligrams per kilogram of body weight, by the way. And if you want to leverage caffeine or maybe even other forms of healthy legal stimulants, those are covered in the caffeine episode. And I'll talk about a few more a little bit later. So to summarize this segment and also just to make a more general point, I think it's very useful for people to start to pay attention to what their tonic level, that is their baseline level of dopamine ought to be in this nigrostriatal circuit and in other circuits. And to do that by learning to assess one's mood and pay attention to what mood they happen to be in. And then to leverage tools. Behavioral tools, maybe pharmacologic tools provided they're safe and they're legal in order to either increase dopamine or to elect not to increase dopamine in order to access the creative process. Now, I've mentioned pharmacology a few times. And I'd like to talk about that just a little bit more"}

practice for motor imagery a systematic literature view on motor imagery training elements in five different disciplines as the title suggests it's mainly for motor imagery training but it extends into music which of course involves motor training and execution but as well as education this review establishes a number of different important things I'm going to read off some of the um key or uh highlight takeaways for instance I described principle one of effective mental training and visualization which is that the visualization be brief and it be simple and it be repeated may ask um how many times that very brief 5 to 15 second exercise of going through some routine should be repeated well different Studies have used different ranges of let's call them repetitions in a given training session but the number that seems to be most effective is somewhere between 50 and 75 repeats per session that brings about the question of how long one should rest between each repeat this gets a little tricky depending on what you're trying to do uh remember that we have this of threshold of about 15 seconds for completion of the entire motor sequence let's say what you're trying to do like a golf swing takes you 5 Seconds to imagine in your mind's eye from the point where you let's just say have the ball on the te you bring the the golf club up you might reposition your your feet just a little bit you know that kind of a little wiggle that golf golfers do and then the swing if that whole thing takes five seconds in your mind's eye and roughly 5 seconds in the real world well then you'd be able to repeat it of course three times in 15 seconds that would be one repetition even though you're doing it three times so it's one 15sec Epoch as it's sometimes called EPO Epoch and then you would rest for an approximately equivalent amount of time 15 seconds or so and then repeat and rest 15 seconds or so and then repeat rest 15 seconds and then repeat again three golf swings within that 15 seconds rest 15 seconds three golf swings within that 15 seconds rest 15 seconds truth told these Epoch and these rest periods do not need to be exact you could imagine for instance that you get three repetitions of the Swing within 14 seconds well then do you do another one or do you wait until the end of that 15 seconds I encourage you not to obsess too much about those sorts of points rather you want to do as many repeats as you can in about a 15-second Epoch and then rest for about 15 seconds and then repeat for a total of 50 to 75 repetitions which might not sound like a lot to some of you might sound like an awful lot to others of you to me it sounds like a lot you know 50 repetitions of something in where you're trying to concentrate in your mind's eye on getting something accomplished over and over over again in exactly the same way might seem like a lot we know based on the learning literature that your ability to successfully perform something in the real world will lend itself to better performance of that thing in the imagined world within your mind's eye that's also one of these sort of does but if you're trying to get better at something that you've never performed before you really should know that the mental training visualization is probably not the best augment to that real world training until you're able to perform it successfully in the real world at least some of the time mental training visualization can be effective however at increasing the accuracy or the frequency at which you can do that real world Behavior so if normally you're only getting the correct swing or you're only hitting the the golf ball correctly say 10% of the time mental training and visualization can really help bring that number up but it is important that you are able to successfully complete that motor task in the real world similarly for performance of cognitive tasks so say for instance um speaking a new language you might ask well gosh what what in the landscape ape of speaking a new language can be restricted to 5 to 15 seconds where I could repeat it anywhere from you know one to three times in a given Epoch and then rest and then keep repeating 50 to 75 times Well there I would encourage you to pick something that you are able to do perhaps very slowly so to speak a particular sentence but with some challenge in getting the accent and the enunciation right but you've completed it successfully before and you want to get more smooth or more fluid with it likewise for you know playing piano guitar again you have to translate to the specific cognitive and or motor activity that you are seeking to improve at but those epochs lasting 5 to 15 seconds are really the Cornerstone of an effective mental training and visualization practice and the repeated nature of it 50 to 75 repetitions in a given session is also another Cornerstone of an effective mental training and visualization practice uh so says this review and some of the other papers that I'm going to get to in a few moments now now one of the other key components of a successful mental training and visualization practice is how often you perform that mental training and visualization practice and again number of different Studies have looked at this through a number of different lenses meaning anywhere from two to eight times per week it does appear that performing these sessions anywhere from 3 to five times per week is going to be effective we could perhaps even say most effective because most of the uh let's just call it the strongest data really point to repeating these 50 to 75 Trials of the same thing three to five times per week so you can come up with a number that's reasonable for you to do consistently and you might ask do you have to continue to perform the mental training and visualization forever and the good news is the answer to that question is no it does seem that once you have what's called Consolidated the Motor Performance or the cognitive performance of something it can be further supported or reinforced that is Consolidated in the neural circuits that are responsible for performing that mental or physical task so in other words once you are performing that cognitive or motor task in a way that's satisfactory or perhaps just improved perhaps you're not 100% but it's improved in the real world you don't need to continue to do mental training and visualization to to maintain that real world performance so that's a good thing in fact the ideal situation would be than to pick a different sequence or thing that you're trying to learn and do mental training and visualization for that uh I perhaps might have misspoke there although I don't want to edit this out I misspoke in the sense that again I said for the thing that you're trying to learn remember mental training visualization is going to be most effective for building up the number of accurate trials or the your ability to do something with a greater frequency of something that you're already capable of doing or have done at least once in the real world okay this is not to say that mental training and visualization can't be used to acquire new skills it can in principle but it has been shown to be most effective for enhancing the speed and the accuracy of skills that one has already demonstrated some degree of proficiency at in the real world I think that's important to point out because we often hear mental training visualization and this equivalence of perceptual and motor experiences in our Mind's Eye to the real world and we think oh all we have to is Imagine doing something and we will get better at it and unfortunately that's not the case the good news is however if you can do something once even very slowly in the real world and then you bring it to the mental imagery and visualization domain you can get much faster at it in a way that really does translate back to the real world I'd like to just take a brief moment and thank one of our podcast"}

{"question": "What is the \"Super Mario Effect\" in learning and how does it relate to repetition and feedback in skill acquisition?", "doc_id": "xJ0IBzCjEPk_11", "video_id": "xJ0IBzCjEPk", "video_title": "How to Learn Skills Faster | Huberman Lab Podcast", "video_header": "Repetitions & The Super Mario Effect: Error Signals vs. Error Signals + Punishment", "segment_idx": "11", "time_start": "28:37", "time_end": "33:55", "context": "of what you are focused on as you attempt to learn a new skill, you can adjust the number of repetitions that you do, you adjust your motivation for learning and you can vastly accelerate learning. Some of you may recognize this by its internet name, which is not a scientific term, which is the super Mario effect. There's actually a quite good video on YouTube describing the super Mario effect. I think it was a YouTuber who has I think a background in science and he did an interesting experiment. And I'll talk about his experiment first and then I will talk about the neurobiology that supports the result that he got. The super Mario effect relates to the game super Mario brothers, but you'll see why at the end. But basically what they did was they had 50,000 subjects, which is a enormous number of subjects learn a program, essentially taking words from a computer program or the commands for a computer program that were kind of clustered in a column on the right. So these are the sorts of things that computer programmers will be familiar with but other people won't. And those commands are essentially, they essentially translate to things like go forward. And then if it's a right hand turn in the maze, then go right and continue until you hit a choice point, et cetera. So it's a bunch of instructions, but the job of the subjects in these experiments were to organize those instructions in a particular way that would allow a little cursor to move through the main successfully. So basically the goal was, or at least what the subjects were told is that anyone can learn to computer program. And if somebody can just organize the instructions in the right way, then they can program this little cursor to move through amaze, very simple. And yet, if you don't have any background in computer programming, or even if you do, it takes some skill. You have to know what commands to give in what particular order. And they made that very easy. You could just assemble them in a list over onto the right. So people started doing this. Now there were two groups and some one half of the subjects, if they got it wrong, meaning they entered a command and the cursor would move and it was the wrong command for this little cursor to move through the maze, they saw a signal jump up on their screen that said, that did not work, please try again. That's it, if they put in the wrong command or is in the wrong sequence, it'll say that did not work please try again. And then the subjects would reorganize the instructions and then the little cursor would continue. And if they got it wrong again, it would say that does not work, please try again. The other half of the subjects, if they got something wrong were told you just lost five points, please continue. So, that's the only difference in the feedback that they got. Now I have to confess, I would have predicted based on my knowledge of dopamine circuitry and reward contingency and epinephrin and stress and motivated learning. And this other thing that we've been told in many many books on behavioral economics and in the self-help literature, which is that people will work much harder to prevent losing something than they will to gain something, that you hear all the time. And it turns out that that's not at all what happened. If they looked at the success rate of the subjects, what they found was that the subjects that were told that did not work, please try again, had a 68% success rate. 68% of them went on to successfully program this cursor moving through the maze. Whereas the ones that were told you lost five points had a 52% success rate, which is a significant difference. But the source of the success or the lack of success is really interesting. The subjects that were told that did not work, please try again, tried many, many more times per unit time. In other words, they made more attempts at programming this thing to allow this cursor to move through the maze. Whereas the people that were told you lost five points gave up earlier or gave up entirely. Okay, so let's just step back from this because to me, this was very surprising. It violates a lot of things that I'd heard in the kind of popular culture or the self-help literature that people will work much harder to avoid losing something than they will to gain something. And it didn't really fit with what I understood about reward contingencies and dopamine, but it did fit well with another set of experiments that I'm very familiar with from the neuroscience literature. And I'll give you the punchline first. And then we're going to take what these data mean and we're going to talk about a learning protocol that you can use that will allow you to learn skills faster by willingly participating in more repetitions of the skill learning, meaning you will want to do more repetitions even if you're getting it wrong some or most of the time. So the experiment that I want to tell you about is called the tube test."}
{"question": "Can repeated exposure to deliberate heat, such as sauna bathing, lead to a decrease in the growth hormone-stimulating effects observed with initial exposure?", "doc_id": "EQ3GjpGq5Y8_13", "video_id": "EQ3GjpGq5Y8", "video_title": "The Science & Health Benefits of Deliberate Heat Exposure | Huberman Lab Podcast #69", "video_header": "Deliberate Heat Exposure & Growth Hormone", "segment_idx": "13", "time_start": "54:53", "time_end": "1:04:25", "context": "to increase growth hormone. Growth hormone is a hormone that we all naturally secrete from our pituitary, which also resides near the roof of our mouth. The signal for the pituitary to release growth hormone arrives from neurons that exist in the hypothalamus. So growth hormone releasing hormones, believe it or not, that's what they're called, stimulate the release of growth hormone from the anterior pituitary gland into the general circulation, and then growth hormone impacts metabolism and growth of cells and tissues of the body. It is responsible for tissue repair as well. And the growth spurt that everyone experiences during puberty is the consequence of growth hormone. What I'm about to describe is a study that found dramatic, really dramatic I should say, increases in growth hormone, but I also want to emphasize that these increases in growth hormone were not of the sort that are observed in puberty or in infants becoming adolescents or adolescents growing into teenagers. Those levels of growth hormone that are associated with those massive transformations, excuse me, of body morphology, of shape, are far greater than the sorts that I'm talking about here. And yet, as all of us age, when we go from adolescence to our teenage years and then into a young adulthood, but then starting in our early 30s or so, the amount of growth hormone that we secrete is greatly diminished. Normally we would release growth hormone every night, after we go to sleep, in particular in the early part of the night when our sleep is comprised mostly of slow-wave sleep. As we age, less growth hormone is released during that slow wave sleep. There are various things that can promote the release of growth hormone, and we will talk about some of those other things in a moment, things like low blood sugar, turns out, is a stimulus for growth hormone release. And I don't mean hypoglycemia of the sort that makes you dizzy and want to pass out. That's bad. I mean, not having high levels of glucose and insulin in your bloodstream. This is one of the reasons why many people are drawn to intermittent fasting or even prolonged fasting, it's because of the reported increases in growth hormone. I'll touch on those briefly, but if you want to learn more about those and what their real impact is and the extent of growth hormone, check out the episode I did on fasting. You can find that at hubermanlab.com. Certain forms of exercise have also been shown to stimulate growth hormone release. And in a few moments, I'll talk about how exercise and fasting can be combined or how heat can be combined with exercise or certain patterns of food intake to further increase growth hormone. But before I do that, I want to review some of the data, and one study in particular, that discovered certain forms of deliberate heat exposure using sauna can stimulate very large increases in growth hormone output, which for people in their 30s, 40s, and beyond could be very useful, and may also be useful for people who are just trying to stimulate the release of more growth hormone in order to, for instance, recover from exercise or stimulate fat loss or muscle growth or repair of a particular injury. The title of this paper is \"Endocrine Effects of Repeated Sauna Bathing.\" And this is a paper that was published in 1986, which is some years ago, but nonetheless serves as a basis for a lot of other studies that followed. So let me describe what they did in this study. They used an 80 degree Celsius environment, so that's 176 degrees Fahrenheit, and they had subjects do the sauna for 30 minutes, four times per day. So that's two hours total in one day, 30 minutes in the sauna, a period of cool down rest, 30 minutes in the sauna again, cool down rest, a third, and a fourth time. So, two hours total in this 80 degree Celsius environment. So that's a lot, but what they observed was really quite significant. So they had subjects do this protocol, and I should mention they had both male and female subjects in this study, and the entire study lasted a week. They did this two hours of sauna exposure on day one, day three, and day seven of that week. And they measured a lot of different hormones, cortisol, thyroid stimulating hormone, thyroid hormone itself, luteinizing hormone, and follicle stimulating hormone, which are hormones that essentially drive the production of other hormones. We won't get into that too deeply, but if you'd like to learn about FSH, follicle stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone, please see the episode on optimizing testosterone and estrogen at hubermanlab.com. They looked at prolactin and they looked at growth hormone. I'll just cut to the chase and tell you the effects on growth hormone. In subjects that did this two hour a day, 80 degree Celsius protocol experienced 16-fold increases in growth hormone. So they measured growth hormone before the sauna and after the sauna and growth hormone levels went up 16 fold, which is obviously an enormous, and it turns out statistically significant, effect. Now, one important caveat here. Remember earlier when I talked about people who did sauna once a week versus two to three times a week versus four to seven times a week, and the more often people did sauna, the less likely they were to die of cardiovascular events or other things of that sort? Well, in this case, the effects of sauna exposure on growth hormone actually went down the more often that people did this deliberate heat exposure. So as I mentioned, they did this two hour a day divided into 30 minute sessions protocol on day one, day three, and day seven of a week. And what they found was on day one, there was a 16-fold increase in growth hormone. On day three, however, there was still a significant effect on growth hormone as compared to before sauna, but that effect was basically cut by two thirds. So now instead of getting a 16-fold increase, it was more like a three or four-fold increase, which is still a huge increase, but not as great as the increase observed on day one. And then on day seven, there tended to be a two, maybe a threefold increase, but not as great as the one observed on day one. What does this mean? And why does this happen? Well, the reason this happens is because heat, just like cold, is a shock or a stressor to the system. In the context of cold, if you get into a very cold ice bath, for instance, a five-degree ice bath, even for 20 seconds, it's known to increase norepinephrine 200%. It can double the amount of norepinephrine that you suddenly release into your brain and body, which actually can have some positive effects. I'll talk about those in a little bit, but if you were to do that every day, you would become cold adapted. This circuit that compares the shelling core of your body would adjust in ways that it could either predict that cold stimulus, or more likely to create some thermogenetic mechanisms in preparation for that cold exposure. This is why, for instance, people that use deliberate cold exposure to try and increase lipolysis, the burning of fat, oftentimes will get results for a while, but then if they're doing it a lot, a lot, they stop getting those effects. I talk a lot about avoiding cold adaptation, if that's your goal, in the episode on cold, but similar mechanisms are at play here. So we have to imagine that when the subjects got into the sauna on day one, whatever pathways went from measurement of temperature at the shell to changes in temperature at the core led to these big increases in growth hormone, which is basically a way of just describing the result I already told you before. But the fact that that result diminished over time either means that the circuit was not as efficient in communicating that shift in temperature or that that shift in temperature was of less impact because the downstream effectors were not engaged to the same extent because it wasn't as much of a shock. And I think the latter explanation is far more likely. This is very much akin to weight training or cardiovascular exercise, where if you run up a hill very fast, for instance, and your lungs are burning and you're heaving and breathing hard, on the first day, that's a very painful thing. But if you do it every day or every other day, provided you allow yourself to recover, pretty soon you're running up that hill and you're not breathing as hard. There isn't as much burning in your muscles, et cetera, et cetera. Your body adapts. So, one of the key things to understand about the use of deliberate heat exposure is if you're going to use it in order to try and trigger massive increases in growth hormone, you're going to need to be careful about not doing it more than, let's say, once a week. Now, I'm extrapolating from this study. Maybe once every 10 days would be even better, but if you start getting heat adapted, it's very unlikely that you're going to get these massive increases in growth hormone. So I don't mean to be discouraging of using deliberate heat exposure to access growth hormone increases, but if that's your specific goal or your main goal, then I think it's reasonable to say that you don't want to do deliberate heat exposure, at least not of the sort that I described here, more than once a week, or maybe even once every 10 days, and that you would want to time that to other events in your life, maybe hard workouts, or if you are trying to push through a fat loss barrier or simply in order to access growth hormone at peak levels, maybe three times per month or four times per month. If you start doing deliberate heat exposure more often, you'll still get increases in growth hormone, but they are not going to be nearly as large as the increases in growth hormone that you're going to experience if you shock your system with deliberate heat exposure every once in a while."}

{"question": "What is the role of the entire digestive tract, including the intestines and the stomach, in the communication between the gut and the brain?", "doc_id": "15R2pMqU2ok_2", "video_id": "15R2pMqU2ok", "video_title": "How to Enhance Your Gut Microbiome for Brain & Overall Health", "video_header": "Your Gut-Brain Axis", "segment_idx": "2", "time_start": "6:58", "time_end": "9:42", "context": "and how your gut and your brain communicate in both directions. Because as I mentioned before, your gut is communicating all the time with your brain and your brain is communicating all the time with your gut. And so the two are in this ongoing dance with one another, that ordinarily is below your conscious detection although you're probably familiar with the experience of every once in a while getting a stomach ache or of eating something that doesn't agree with you, or conversely eating something that you find particularly delicious and that sensation or that experience rather being a whole body experience. Your mind is excited about what you're eating or just ate, your gut is excited about what you're eating or just ate, and it seems to be a kind of unified perception of both brain and body. Today, we're going to talk about how that comes about in the negative sense. Like, you know, when you meet someone you really dislike or when you have a stomach ache, and in the positive sense, when you interact with somebody that you really, really like and you'd like to spend more time with them, for instance, or when you eat something that you really, really like and you'd like to spend more time with that food, so to speak. Now, the gut and the brain represent what we call a biological circuit, meaning they include different stations. So station A communicates with station B, which communicates with station C, and so on. And as I mentioned earlier, it is bidirectional. It's a two-way street between gut and brain. I want to make the important point at the outset that when I say the word gut, when I refer to the gut, I am not just referring to the stomach. Most of us think that the gut equates to the stomach because we think of having a gut or not having a gut or having a gut feeling of some sort. But in the context of gut-brain signaling and the related microbiome, the gut includes the entire digestive tract. That's right, from start to finish the entire digestive tract so much so that today we're going to talk about, for instance, the presence of neurons, nerve cells, that reside in your gut that communicate to specific locations in the brain and cause the release of specific neurochemicals, such as the neurochemical dopamine or serotonin, that can motivate you to seek more of a particular food or type of interaction or behavior, or to avoid particular foods, interactions, and behaviors. And some of those neurons, many of those neurons, in fact, reside in your intestines, not in your stomach. They can be in the small intestine or the large intestine. In fact, you actually have taste receptors and neurons located all along your digestive tract. You have neurons that are located all along your digestive tract and they are communicating to your brain to impact what you think, what you feel, and what you do. Okay, so for the gut-brain axis, we need to deal with the brain part and then we need to deal with the gut part."}
{"question": "What are the differences in short-term and long-term effects on the body between taking cold showers, cold plunges up to the neck, and simply being outside on a cold day?", "doc_id":

people wonder about what are the differences in terms of impact short-term and perhaps even long term between cold showers cold plunge to the neck so that could be in ice water or just very cold water um immersion with dunking one's head and then coming up because obviously people have to come up for air at some point and then simply being outside on a cold day in shorts and a t-shirt or something of that sort so there are different outcomes um because there they are very different uh exposures of the cold to your cold receptors in your skin so the more you can say you cover your body in the cold which you would do in cold water because there of course cover totally and then and the molecules are closer to your skin you will have a more potent um activation of all your cat receptors in the skin so that one will definitely activate your autonomous nervous system more and Rapid H compared to going out in a t-shirt in the cold wind just go for a walk um but that is also something that's going to activate your uh sympathetic nervous system meaning then that you will have an increase in nor panine and you will activate something called uh the the brown fat so this is a healthy kind of fat tissue that we have in our body and when you activate that that's going to um increase your metabolism before we talk about Brown fat and I'm so glad you brought it up um because so much to talk about there uh what about cold shower I mean obviously cold shower is somewhere in between yeah um being out outside in the Air Cold Air versus uh being immersed up to the neck if we had more studies on on cold showers we would learn more about how does that activate our metabolism how does that increase our neurotransmitters in the brain which could also have an impact our on our mental balance so I think that would be interesting for the future um but what we do know is from from from activating Brown fat and both from rodent St studies but also in humans is that as soon as we get cold on our skin we will activate our Brown fat so it is is kind of like our first responder in in the body to keep uh our um temperature up so our muscles is like the second tissue in our body we have two tissues which can increase our thermogenesis so the brown fat which is like always like temperature regulating our body and then we have uh the the muscles which will secondarily H start to shiver and that's going to increase our um temperature in the body but as soon as you go into a cold shower you will activate your fat also immediately so it could be good also for increasing metabolism in theory because we haven't really any studies showing how much does it actually activate the brown fat so if someone out there wants to do a study on that great I've thought about why there are fewer studies of cold showers than cold immersion and I think the answer to my mind is that from a methodological standpoint it's just harder to do because if people are getting into cold water up to the neck they're getting into cold water up to the the neck whereas if people are getting into a cold shower some people are larger or smaller some people are going to stand under the shower with it hitting their head some people the back of the neck you could direct people to do it yeah but it's a little bit um more difficult also I think uh for you and I are both research scientists there's a little bit of a um methological challenge that might seem silly to people but it's a real one which is if people are in a cold shower also the water is going to be I'm kind of pushing their clothing against their skin there's a certain vulnerability in uh for most people um coming to a laboratory in the first place let alone being observed while they shower whereas when you get into cold IM cold immersion you're getting under the water and you know some people might roll their eyes and say okay really is that the barrier but you know science exists in these real world contexts and this will vary by culture and things of that sort but we run human subjects in my lab and I'll tell you just um the process of getting people to the laboratory and having them Park and find the lab and you know it's a whole new environment with people in lab coats and people moving around and Where's the restroom I mean there's a there's a certain amount of stress just associated with taking part in a study for most human subjects so um I uh totally agree however we need more studies of of cold showers it's just a harder environment to control in in my in my mind so it"}

to others nowadays with social media we get a window into gosh probably billions of social interactions in the form of comments and clapbacks and retweets and and there certainly is benevolence on social media but what if any data exists about um how social media either feeds uh or impedes cynicism or maybe it doesn't change it at all um and I should say that there's also the kind of um I have to be careful I'm trying not to be cynical um there I maintain the the view that certain social media platforms um encourage uh a bit more negativity than others um and certainly there are accounts I'm trying to think of like accounts like uh on Instagram like Upworthy which it's a whole basis is to you know promote positive stuff I like that account very much um but certainly you can find the full array of emotions on social media uh to what extent is just being on social media regardless of platform increasing or decreasing cynicism it's a it's a terrific question uh it's hard to provide a very clear answer and I don't want to get out over my skis with what is known and what's not known social media has been a tectonic shift in our lives it has coincided with a rise in cynicism but as you know history is not an experiment so you can't take two temporal trends that are coincident with one another and say that one caused the other that said my own intuition and a lot of the data suggest that in at least some ways social media is a cynicism Factory right I mean so so let's first stipulate how much time we're spending on there I mean the average person uh goes through 300 feet of social media feed a day is that right they've measured it in feet approximately the height of the Statue of Liberty yeah so we're we're doing one Statue of Liberty worth of scrolling a day much of it Doom scrolling if if if you're anything like me at least um and so then the question becomes what are we seeing when we scroll for that long who are we seeing and are they representative of what people are really like and the answer in a lot of ways is uh no that what we see on social media is not representative of the human population so there's a lot of evidence uh a lot of this comes from uh from William Brady now at Northwestern and Molly Crockett uh that when people tweet for instance I mean this a lot of this is done on on the site formerly known as Twitter when people tweet in Outrage and when they tweet negatively and when they tweet about in particular immorality right moral outrage that algorithmically those tweets are broadcast further they're shared more and this does a couple of things one it reinforces the people who are already tweeting in that way so William Brady has this great work using a kind of reinforcement learning model right reinforcement learning is where you do something you're rewarded and that reward makes you more likely to do that same thing again and it turns out that uh that Brady found that when people tweet in Outrage and then get egg Ed on and often times I should say this is tribal in nature it's somebody tweeting against somebody who's an outsider and then being rewarded by people who they consider to be part of their group right when that happens that person is more likely in their future tweets to turn up the volume on that outrage and on that moral outrage in particular so there's a sort of Ratchet effect right on the people who are sharing but a second question becomes well what about the people watching what about the rest of us Claire Robertson has a great paper on this where she documents that a vast majority I mean 90 plus% of tweets are created by the 10% of the most active users right and this is in the political sphere and these are probably not representative these folks not representative of the rest of us in terms of how extreme uh and maybe how how bitter their opinions are and so we when we're scrolling that Statue of Liberty's worth of information we think that we're seeing the world we think that we're seeing our fellow citizens we think that we're getting a picture of what people are like in fact we're pulling from the fringes and what this leads to is a misconstrual of what the world is really like this is by the way not just part of social media it's also part of Legacy Media communication theorists talk about something called The mean world syndrome right where the more time that you spend looking at the news for instance the more you think violent crime is up in your area the more you think you're in danger of violent crime even during years when violent crime is decreasing I'm old enough to remember uh when stranger danger was this big uh massive story and every time you wanted cereal the milk carton would have a picture of a kid who had been kidnapped by a stranger and during that time if you ask people how many kids are being kidnapped by strangers in the US they would they would in many cases say 50,000 children are being kidnapped each year in the US 50 can you imagine what the world would it would be there would be SWAT teams on every corner the real number in those years was closer to 100 kids per year now let me be clear each one of those is an absolute tragedy but there's a big difference here and often times when we tune into media we end up with these enormously warped perceptions where think that the world is much more dangerous than it really is we think that people are much more extreme than they really are and because stories of immorality go viral so much more often than stories of everyday goodness I mean I love Upworthy as well but it's not winning right now in the in the in the social media Wars not yet not yet and so this leaves us all absolutely exhausted and also feeling alone people who feel like wow I actually don't feel that much outrage or I don't want to feel that much outrage I actually don't want to hate everybody who's different from me for instance uh I'm just exhausted by all this we feel like well I guess I'm the only one because everybody else seems real excited about this battle royale that we've put ourselves in but in fact most people are just like the exhausted majority right we're paying so much attention to a to a tiny minority of what the journalist Amanda Ripley calls conflict entrepreneurs people who Stoke conflict on purpose that were confusing them with the average so much there um I I

4 or 5 a.m. and I would ride the wave if I happened to be in the zone if I weren't in the zone I wouldn't force it and I would try to get more sleep but I have always performed best with my writing in those witching hours of let's call it 10: p.m. to 4:00 a.m. and my experience is that the writers I've interviewed the the writer friends I've become close with if you look at when they made themselves not necessarily what they do now right but what they did that eventually got them to escape velocity they're almost always doing most of their writing very late at night or very early in the morning when the rest of the world or their social group is inactive wow yeah and I say wow because uh of course all of this was prior to the publication of Matt Walker's seminal book right why we sleep which I really see as the book that shifted a lot of people fortunately from the I'll sleep when I'm dead mindset uh to I'll you know to really paying attention to it and um you know I don't think that gets enough credit I mean there uh there's been a revision of a few points within that book but the majority of it is just spot on and Hyper legitimate so good and um and yet what you're describing is a schedule that you know starting to write at 900 p.m. and finishing up around 4:00 a.m. but you talked about research earlier that day and training and eating so were there naps in there I would sleep from say 4: to maybe 11 or 12 so I would be getting up later and I've had conversations with Matt about this and there are night owls and morning Larks and there are certainly differences in the code meaning the genetics but that worked very very well for me for a very long time it is however a very challenging social schedule so once you have a significant other and every girlfriend I've ever had is a morning person if you want to spend time together that schedule just does not work so I made compromises later for the social side of things but if if you put a gun to my head and said you need to write the best book humanly possible that is your only priority outside of some exercise and fuel I would follow the same schedule I know several um very successful podcasters Lex fredman in particular who I think he's trying to follow a more normal schedule now but he's pseudo nocturnal at least by my ex my read yeah um and there are couple other uh online content creators um Derek from more plates more dates who's hyperproductive in his domain and is mostly nocturnal um and then as you're describing your writing routine and your overall routine I was thinking that you know the the great skateboarder everyone knows Tony Hawk who is obviously a great skateboarder no doubt about that but Rodney Mullen who invented the all on Street the kickflip the all like Rodney is basically nocturnal and has been for a long time and would you know skateboard up and down the bordwalk in Santa Monica in the middle of the night because lack of distraction is really was and he's been doing that since his teens I don't know what he's doing these days but I think a lot of creators just need space and and I always wonder if that's because when they at least the ones that are not uh socially dysfunctional like yourself who when they are around people there's this almost hopefully a desire to interact so you almost have to remove the stimulus completely yeah it it it removes the plausible deniability which might not be the perfect use of that phrase but in the sense that you it's harder to fool yourself into thinking you're doing something important when you're checking your messages or social media at 2: in the morning who are we kidding folks you should be writing in this case right and writers will do anything to avoid writing I remember IR Rand wrote a book about writing which is actually fantastic I can't remember the exact title it might just be on non-fiction writing something like that and she talked about polishing the sneakers or the shoes before writing like I really just need to do this one thing which is to just clean up that shoe because somebody should really clean it up and at some point I should clean it up and therefore why don't I just do there's no time like the present I'll just do that it's all to avoid writing which is the harder thing and in my conversations with Matt also I should say that as someone who has self-described as a person who struggles with onset insomnia Matt made the point and sometimes we need to relearn things maybe you should just go to bed later sure and that might address some of this onset insomnia and I don't know the causes for that but I do get a Second Wind very late could be related to some cortisol release abnormality or just different scripting in my system who

And for many people those devices can be quite useful. Some people are only gauging their sleep by way of whether or not they feel rested, whether or not they feel like they're learning and they're getting better or not. There are some things that one can really do. And the first one might surprise you in light of everything I've said, and probably everything you've heard about sleep. There was a study done by a Harvard undergraduate, Emily Hoagland, who was in Robert Stickgold's lab at the time. And that's the study explored how variations in total sleep time related to learning, as compared to total sleep time itself. And to summarize the study, what they found was that it was more important to have a regular amount of sleep each night as opposed to the total duration. In other words, and what they showed was that improvements in learning or deficits in learning were more related to whether or not you got six hours, six hours, five hours, six hours,"}

system it breaches the physical barrier of your skin and mucosal lining now you have in mind all the different ways that could happen and all the different ways that could be prevented but we are starting at a point here a hypothetical point whereby that colder flu virus has made it into your body your immune system has an absolutely exquisitely sophisticated way of knowing you versus other meaning cells within your body that are of you and cells of your body that are from other organisms or viruses from the outside world and when viruses such as a cold or flu virus are detected in your body your body might not even recognize that it's a cold or flu virus it might not even recognize that it's a virus at all it just knows that this thing that's in me is of other it's not me I've never seen it before this is not me these are not my cells these are not the chemicals that I'm producing and your immune system is amazing in that way and when it occurs your innate immune system launches a response what is that response well first of all the response is very rapid right colder flu makes it into your body and your innate immune system immediately or near immediately launches an attack on that Invader or Invaders because as soon as the virus gets into your body it's going to start replicating as quickly as it can what happens white blood cells that your body produces will go to the sites where those viruses are and the by the way those viruses are basically getting into cells of your body and then hijacking the genetic Machinery of those cells in order to replicate within those cells and then exit those cells and then go infect more cells that's how these viruses work your body's making white blood cells things like neutrophils natural killer cells macras these are what we call affector cells that act as a kind of ambulance system and go to the sites that those viruses exist and the cells that they've infected and start trying to physically barrier them in and also use specific chemical mechanisms to neutralize and kill those viruses again anytime you're think about biology think mechanical features and chemical features of a response now a key component of the innate immune system is What's called the complement system not complement like oh you look very nice today but complement okay the complement system which exists in the plasma within your blood these are chemicals in your bloodstream that go and Mark specific cells that have been infected or viruses with a signal a chemical signal that essentially looks like an eat me signal to these other cell types of your immune system such that those natural killer cells go through the body and go looking for the cells that have this eat me signal on them and try and destroy those particular cells the other thing that urinate immune system does is that the cells that have been infected and that are undergoing damage remember they have colder flu virus within them and they're hijacking the cell or Machinery of those cells and using it to produce their own virus more of the virus and as a consequence the genetic Machinery of those cells is not able to do a bunch of other things that it normally can do or at least not as well well those cells that are really hurting release a help me signal and then in response to that help me signal your immune system releases what are called cyto kindes things like interlukin 1 interlan 6 tumor necrosis Factor Alpha just fancy nerd names for different types of molecules that go to the site of infection and try to help or assist to remove that infection and they also Tred to assist the repair of the cells that have been infected by those viruses now one of the mechanical or physical consequences of these chemical signals like Incan 1 Incan 6 tnf Alpha again those are all cyto kindes being drawn to a particular cell or region of cells that have been infected is that it creates some physical swelling of the area it impacts the vasculature the veins and capillaries that feed that area and in response to they put more blood there so you get some swelling or you'll get in some cases the release of histamines right we think of anti-histamine drugs well histamines are an aspect of your immune system they move around in your body in these really cool cells called masted cells Mas mass cells and when the histamines are released that area becomes kind of hot and swelling it's what we call edema and that whole area is marked as really a sight just like a crash site on the side of the road it's like hey we've got eat me signals to get the debris and the bad stuff out of here try to get those viruses out of here we've got help me signals to try and help the injured cells just like you would try and help people at a car crash and there's a bunch of swelling so there's additional blood flow sometimes there's some other physical features as well now the important thing to know is that the innate immune system is very fast and it is agnostic to the type of infection in fact it doesn't even matter if it's a bacterial physical fungal or viral infection but it certainly isn't paying attention to the exact serotype of cold virus or whether or not it's an H1 influenza or another type of influenza so way to think about the innate immune system is that it is a very fast and non-specific response to a viral or other type of Invader now that's all a bunch of biology but if you think about it let's imagine a scenario where you go to a party hang out the party you don't see anyone coughing or sneezing but maybe one person there has a cold virus or they have a flu virus and they aren't even aware of it they're not going to come down with symptoms for another day or so you talk to that person you shake hands maybe touch your eyes maybe you don't but you're exposed to that colder flue virus you go home you go to sleep you wake up the next morning you feel fine and then sometime in the next afternoon you know you start to feel a little tickle in your throat or you start to feel just a little bit of fatigue or malaise do you have that colder flu well possibly okay we don't know for sure but assuming that that cold or flu virus did indeed make it into your system then your immune system is starting to create a set of responses that we talked about a moment ago but it also tends to impact things at the level of your brain such that you kind of feel like you know I don't feel quite right I feel like a little bit I don't feel great and there are a lot of reasons why you would feel that way and we'll talk about those reasons a little bit later but does that mean that you're necessarily coming down with a colder flu well technically yes your inate immune system is deployed to fight this foreign viral Invader but whether or not you actually get a full-blown cold or flu or put differently how severe that cold or flu infection is depends depends on whether or not your innate immune system can fight off that colder flu at the outset and indeed there are many cases we believe where you get exposed to a colder flu it makes it into your body but your innate immune system is sufficient to beat it to fight it back this is one of the reasons why it's so important that if you're starting to feel a bit under the weather and you think you're coming down with a colder flu that you do certain things in order to make sure that your innate immune system is both ready and that it can launch a fullscale attack on that colder flu virus we're going to talk about how to do that a little bit later I'm not trying to withhold it's just it's important to understand that just because the virus makes it into your body doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to get a full-blown cold or flu and in fact that inate immune system sometimes is sufficient to prevent that colder flu from replicating enough that you get the full-blown set of symptoms and that's kind of an ideal scenario so we're definitely going to talk today about what to do if you start to feel a little bit of malaise what to do if you just discover that oh you know that person I was hanging out with at the party the night before they're really sick with a colder flu because there are things you can do to increase the probability that your innate immune system can handle the battle sufficiently such that you never have to get to the next component of the immune response which is the Adaptive immune response I'd like to take a quick break and thank our sponsor insid tracker"}

Should they be looking at the sunrise and should they be watching the sunset? Waking up with a sunset, going asleep at the sunrise. You think, well, is that light going to throw them off? Ah, probably not. It's just actually going to invert what sunrise and sunset are. When they're waking up in the morning, if they look at the, you know, they get some sunlight in their eyes, they look at the sun and get some bright light from devices or overhead lights in their apartment or home, well, that's going to tend to wake them up if it's in the evening, right? So it's, you know I don't know if I stated that clearly, but if in the evening the sun is setting and they're looking at that setting sun, that is the morning sun for that person and it will wake them up for their night shift. So temperature rising. Then toward morning, what's happening? Okay, well, they're closing out their work shift. You're going home, the sun is rising. Do you look at the rising sun? Well, based on what you now know your eyes are very sensitive to resetting of circadian clocks. What will it do at that time? If this were a classroom, I would either cold call on somebody or I'd wait for the oh, oh, oh, oh person in the audience that inevitably exists. So temperature is for that person, they've been up for a while, temperature is falling, not rising. For me it will be rising. But 'cause I'm diurnal, I'm awake during the day. For that person the temperature's falling and so they view light while temperature is falling. What's it going to do? It's going to phase delay them. It's going to make it harder for them to get to sleep the following night. So you would say that person should watch the setting sun to help them wake up 'cause they're going to work the night shift, but should probably have sunglasses on or avoid viewing bright light before they go to sleep. So it's the same thing. They're just on an inverted as a typical person who's diurnal, but they're on an inverted schedule. And so I'm really trying hard here to make this all really clear. There are kind of two patterns of requests in the world I'm noticing as I've kind of ventured into the this landscape of social media and podcasts. There are people who want to know every detail and want to quantify everything 'cause they want to get exactly right. These are like the graduate students and students that don't want to make a mistake."}

It is however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is ROKA. ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are of the absolute highest quality. The company was founded by two all American swimmers from Stanford and everything about ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses was designed with performance in mind. I spent a lifetime working on the visual system and I can tell you that our visual system has to contend with a lot of different challenges. For instance, when you move from a shady area to a brightly lit area, your eyes in your brain have to adjust in order for you to be able to see clearly. ROKA, eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed with the biology of the visual system in mind. So you never notice those transitions. They're very seamless. You always see things with perfect clarity. The other terrific thing about ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses is they are extremely lightweight. Most of the time, I can't even remember that I'm wearing them. I wear readers at night and I wear sunglasses sometimes in the daytime when it is very brighter or I'm driving and so on.

Inside tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact our immediate and long-term health can only be measured and assessed with a quality blood test. And nowadays with the advent of modern DNA tests, we can also get insight into, for instance, our biological age and see how that compares to our chronological age. And of course, despite what our birthday cake screams back at us, it is our biological age that really matters. If you're going to get blood tests or DNA tests, however, you need to be able to interpret the data. And that's really where inside tracker stands apart. A lot of companies will give you a DNA test or a blood test. They'll send you values of hormones, metabolic markers, etcetera, but you don't know what to do with those data. InsideTrackeris a very easy to use platform. So when you get the numbers back, you can click on any of the numbers that either are in range or out range, too low, too high, etcetera, and it will direct you towards specific behavioral tools, so lifestyle factors, nutritional tools, supplement tools, etcetera, that can help you bring those numbers into the ranges that are best for you, which is really an exceptional tool that makes all the blood tests and DNA tests really exceptionally powerful.

Today's episode is also brought to us by Blinkist. Blinkist is an app that has thousands of non-fiction books condensed down to just 15 minutes each of key takeaways that you can read or listen to, to extract the most important knowledge from those books. I love reading physical books, literally physical hard copies of books. And I like listening to audio books. However, I also like to revisit books that I've read or listened to, and sometimes I just want to get the key points or the key takeaways from a book that I've never read or listened to. Blinkist is terrific for all of that. For instance, when researching our episodes on sleep, one of the books that I read and found very valuable is Matt Walker, professor at UC Berkeley's book, \"Why We Sleep,\" I've read that book, but then I wanted to also make sure that I hit the key takeaways. Blinkist was essential for that. Other books that I've read before and that I own and enjoy, but I listened to the Blinkist version of from time to time are things like Tim Ferris's \"The 4-Hour Body\" or Tim Ferris's The 4-Hour Chef book, both of which are excellent or Nassim Taleb's \"The Black Swan\" and there are many other titles as well. Blinkist is also a great way to finally get through many of the books that you've been meaning to read, but haven't had time for. With Blinkist, you get unlimited access to reader or listen to a massive library of condensed non-fiction books. Right now, Blinkist has a special offer just for our Huberman lab podcast audience. If you go to blinkist.com/huberman, you can get a free seven day trial and get 25% off a Blinkist premier membership. That's Blinkist spelled B-L-I-N-K-I-S-T, blinkist.com/huberman to get 25% off and a seven day free trial. And now for my discussion with Dr. Paul Conti."}

can evoke emotions within us now if that's not amazing enough music can not only describe and evoke emotions it can also imply intent think for instance about drumming that you would hear off in the distance and we're not talking about we're talking drumming of this sort and perhaps the Cadence of that drumming changes such that as it's approaching it gets more and more frequent what is the intent being implied well we know from numerous studies and you know from numerous movies that you've seen and heard that that sort of low frequency drumming of increasing Cadence as it approaches is implying the intent of aggression or War or at least is implying that something serious is going to happen now contrast that with a different frequency of sound played at a higher case done now the second set of tones are far less clear in terms of what they mean what their intent is but if we contrast them with let's just call them what they're typically called the war drums or the drums that that convey a sense of aggressive intent what we create then is a juxtaposition of two different emotional states in you perhaps or maybe you don't respond to those with any robust emotional shift but we are conveying two separate or distinct sets of intent now of course spoken language can convey intent I could say for instance you know I'm going to help you how can I help you today or I could say I'm gonna hurt you right of course with spoken language you could do that and you could change the intonation of that language you change the frequency so if I were to say I'm going to hurt you it's very different than if I say I'm gonna hurt you okay or if I put it as a question I'm gonna hurt you okay so with language of course there's also the opportunity for a lot of nuance depending on where the inflections where the accents are on a particular phrase even a particular word but with music as you recall when we convey a sense of intent we are also conveying that sense of intent through the body of The Listener not just bringing it in through their ears and so when we do that what we do is we start to recruit a huge number of neural circuits that are involved not just in understanding or a sense of empathy for an emotion but rather that can recruit movement or what we call pre-motor circuits in the body pre-motor circuits are the neurons that start to fire before a particular pattern of action is generated and so when we hear music that conveys emotion that evokes emotion and especially when we hear music that conveys a sense of intent from the outside we too start to feel as if we need to move or respond to that music in a particular way now what I just described to you is not something that's learned in fact it is innate how do we know that well there are some beautiful studies that have explored how babies respond to music indeed how babies respond to specific types of music specific frequencies of sound spacing between particular notes and on and on it's been demonstrated for instance that babies as young as three months old respond to music very differently than they respond to just other forms of sound scrambled in time now of course babies that are three months old aren't speaking so you could ask them does that sound like music how does it make you feel Etc they're not going to answer at least not with any coherence because they don't have spoken language yet but despite their absence of language we know that babies as young as three months old respond to music because they do so with rhythmic movements of their bodily Limbs and actually their torso as well now a little bit later we will touch on this issue of what types of music evoke movement of the Torso versus movement of the limbs versus movement of the Torso and limbs no I'm not going to dance for you during this podcast however there's a really interesting story there that relates to how primitive or evolved the motor neurons the neurons that actually move the musculature are and how primitive or evolved the music that one listens to is but just to give you a sense of where that's headed in this study where they examined the responses of very young babies to music what they found is that certain frequencies of sound evoked movements in those babies that were rhythmic where it was mostly their torso moving back and forth and maybe their head a little bit whereas other patterns of sound different frequencies in different Arrangements evoked movement of their limbs more than their torso and still other patterns of sounds evoked movement of their torso Limbs and head in other words babies dancing and if you've ever been to a wedding or a party or been out dancing you will see people who include more torso versus limb versus limb and torso movement when they dance and yes of course some of this relates to Proficiency in dancing Comfort on the Dance Floor Etc but there are some Universal rules out there about how certain frequencies and patterns of sound AKA music evokes different types of bodily movements so starting from a very young age prior to any instruction in terms of how to dance or what music is babies are dancing to music and that highlights an important point that we will return to again and again throughout today's episode which is that the systems of the brain that respond specifically to movement not just sound but specifically to musical sounds are intimately tied to the neural circuits of the body that generate movement and this is especially important to understand when we get into our discussion about music and our sense of motivation okay so the list of"}
{"question": "How can using a metronome to set a slightly faster pace help athletes increase repetitions and improve skill execution at an advanced intermediate level?", "doc_id": "xJ0IBzCjEPk_22", "video_id": "xJ0IBzCjEPk", "video_title": "How to Learn Skills Faster | Huberman Lab Podcast", "video_header": "How To Move From Intermediate To Advanced Skill Execution faster: Metronomes", "segment_idx": "22", "time_start": "1:11:09", "time_end": "1:16:43", "context": "of skill in a given practice or sport or instrument. And if you're in this sort of advanced intermediate or advanced levels of proficiency for something, there is a practice that you can find interesting data for in the literature, which involves metronoming. So this you'll realize relates to generating repetitions and it relates to the tone experiment where it doesn't really matter what your attention is cued to as long as you are performing many many reps of the motor sequence. You can use a metronome and obviously musicians do this, but athletes can do this too. You can use a metronome to set the cadence of your repetitions. Now for swimmers, there's actually a device. I was able to find online, I forgot what the brand name was and that's not what this is about, but that actually goes in the swim cap that can cue you to when you need to perform another stroke. And for runners, there are other metronome type devices that through headphones or through a tone in the room if you're running indoors or on a treadmill we'll cue you to when you basically you need to lift your heels. And if you do that, what athletes find is they can perform more repetitions, they can generate more output, you can increase speed. A number of really interesting things are being done with auditory metronoming. And then I'm involved in a little bit of work now that hopefully I'll be able to report back to you about using stroboscopic metronoming. So actually changing the speed of the visual environment. These are fun experiments, basically changing one's perception of how fast they're moving through space by playing with the visual system, something for a future discussion. But you can start to use auditory metronoming for generating more movements per unit time and generating more errors and therefore more successes and more neuroplasticity. There are a number of different apps out there. I found several free apps where you can set in a metronome pace, or it might be tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick. That's a little fast for most things, but you can imagine if this were darts or this were golf swings that it might be tick, tick, tick, tick or something more like tick, tick. And every time the metronome goes, you swing. Every time the metronome goes, you throw a dart. Actually there's some wild experiments out there. You know there's a world championship of cup stacking. There's a young lady who I saw could take all these cups spread out on a table and basically just stack them into the perfect pyramid in the least amount of times and all the kids go wild. This is something I'd never thought to pursue and frankly never will pursue unless my life depends on it for some reason, but it's really impressive. And if you look at the sequence 'cause these have been recorded, you can look this up on YouTube. What you'll find is that these expert cup stackers, it's just all about error elimination. But they're two metronomic and auditory cues can actually cue them to pick up the cups faster than they would ordinarily and to learn to do that. You can do this for anything. I think cup stacking is probably not a skill most of you are interested in doing, but for any skill, if you figure out at what rate you are performing repetitions per unit time and you want to increase that slightly, you set a metronome which is slightly faster than your current rate and you just start generating more repetitions. Now what's interesting about this and is cool is it relates back to the experiment from Lappe and colleagues, which is your attention is now harnessed to the tone, to the metronome, not necessarily to what you're doing in terms of the motor movement. And so really you need a bit of proficiency. Again, this is for people who are in intermediate or advanced intermediate or advanced. But what you're essentially doing is you're creating an outside pressure, a contingency so that you generate, again, more errors. So it's all about the errors that you get. Now, these aren't errors where all the cups tumble or you have to stop or you can't keep up, you have to set the pace just a little bit beyond what you currently can do. And when you do that, you're essentially forcing the nervous system to make errors and correct the errors inside of the session. I find this really interesting because what it means is, again you've got sensory perception, what you're paying attention to, proprioception where your limbs are and the motor neurons in your upper lower motor neurons and central pattern generators. And you can't pay attention to, \"Well, they're my upper motor neurons, \"they're my lower motor neurons.\" Forget that, you're not going to do that. You can't pay attention to your proprioception too much. That would be the super slow motion would be the proprioception. But you have to harness your attention to something. And if you harness your attention to this outside contingency, this metronome that's firing off and saying, now go, now go, now go. Not only can you increase the number of repetitions, errors and successes, but for some reason and we don't know why, the regular cadence of the tone of the metronome and the fact that you are anchoring your movements to some external force, to some external pressure or cue seems to accelerate the plasticity and the changes and the acquisition of skills beyond what it would be if you just did the same number of repetitions without that outside pressure. We don't know exactly what the mechanism is. Presumably it's neurochemical, like there's something about keeping up with a timer or with a pace that presumably and I'm speculating here, causes the release of particular chemicals. But I think it's really cool. Metronomes, they're totally inexpensive, at least the ones that you use outside of water are very inexpensive. You can find these free apps, you can use a musical metronome. So metronomes are a powerful tool as well in particular for speed work. So for sprinting or swimming or running where the goal is to generate more strokes"}

We, as always here on this podcast, are going to discuss some of the science, we get into mechanism, but we also really get at principles. Principles are far more important than any one experiment or one description of mechanism and certainly far more important than any one protocol because principles allow you to think about your nervous system and work with it in ways that best serve you. They are very flexible batches of information. We are going to talk about the principles of neuroplasticity for removing pain and wound healing and injury. We're going to talk about acupuncture, of all things.

I think, intermittent fasting, cold, heat, exercise, I mean, maybe even intermittent sleep deprivation. I keep waiting for the intermittent sleep deprivation movement. I will say, I pull a few all-nighters per year just for work demands and procrastination and deadlines. I'm the worst combination of academic 'cause I'm both a procrastinator and a perfectionist, so you end up pulling some all-nighters. The sleep I get the next night is pretty amazing. I must say, it's the sleep of gods, but I don't recommend anyone use sleep deprivation for that. But I could imagine that we also evolved having some sleepless nights. So this idea of intermittent challenge is a really attractive one, and I want to make sure that we credit you with the phrase intermittent challenge. - No, credit Dr. Mark Mattson. - Okay. Dr. Mark Mattson gets credit. - Who's published, and he has used that- - He used those words. - Oh, that phrase. - Yes. - Okay, great. We'll make sure. - Just like Dr. David Sinclair, I love the xenohormesis. It was in one of his publications so many years ago, and I just love it. Brilliant. A brilliant term. So Mark Mattson gets credit. - Those Harvard guys are pretty smart. I mean, it's a good school, I guess. Of course it's a good school. We will credit the appropriate people. Thank you for that clarification. So you've talked a lot about the use of what I call deliberate cold exposure, only to distinguish it from cold that you might just be accidentally exposed to, but it's sort of obvious when we say cold exposure. There are some amazing data on cold. The other day I saw a post from you, and you've included this in talks before. I did not know this until I learned it from you, so credit to you, that even 20 seconds of immersion in, I think, it was four degree. - 49 degree Fahrenheit. - 49 degree Fahrenheit. Okay, I was translating to Celsius, but 49 degree Fahrenheit water, so cold water, can lead to long-lasting increases in epinephrine, adrenaline, and I have to presume other neuromodulators and neurochemicals as well. What are some cold protocols that you find particularly interesting or attractive from the standpoint of, I dunno, pick your favorite, metabolism, neuro/mood effects, brown fat stimulation, which, of course, weaves back to metabolism. We could do an entire episode all about cold, but what I'd love to know is, what sort of activity or stimulus do you think is a reasonable and particularly potent one to use in terms of cold? - So, today, I did three minutes at 49 degrees Fahrenheit. I have a cold tub. - So you get in up to your neck? - Well, I try. I keep floating up. It's like really hard. I would say maybe most of my shoulder. I mean, really I'm floating up. I was telling my husband. I was like, \"There's too much water in here for me.\" - Or too much salt in there? Is it like the Dead Sea where you float on top? - Is there salt in there? I don't know. He takes care of all the stuff that, you know. It's the Plunge. - By the way, the podcast nor I am sponsored by Plunge. They did give me one. That thing is fantastic. Also, 'cause it circulates the water. - It does. - Which makes sure that you break up the thermal layer, and it's even colder. - It is even colder. It sucks! Anyways, so look, I'll be honest here. I wish I did more cold than I do. I do cold when I'm going to go on a podcast. I definitely do cold when I'm going to do a podcast, when I'm going to give a talk or when I'm anxious. I need to make it more of a ritual. I love doing the sauna. I hate the cold. I hate it, unless it's summertime. It's a lot easier for me to get in the cold in the summertime. But what I do love about the cold is how I feel after. And I feel less anxious. I feel good. I feel more focused, which is why I'll usually do it before any type of public speaking, or when I'm just anxious, I'll just get in there. And so the 20 seconds at 49 degrees, I think it was 49 degrees Fahrenheit was really a good number because time and temperature, time, or duration, I guess, would be a better word, and temperature do matter, but you can do 20 seconds at a colder temperature, which is I prefer, or you can do a minute or longer at a warmer temperature. I think there was another study showing 59 degrees Fahrenheit at one hour was like two to three, but who wants to do one hour at 59? - Yeah, I'm familiar with that study. So this really reveals just how absolutely nerdy I am and maybe why some times and relationships in my life were challenged. I love reading the method sections of papers. So people can come at me with a number of things about papers, and I might miss something. Surely I miss certain things, like anybody does, but the methods I relish in reading the methods, and that paper is really interesting 'cause they had people sit in lawn chairs basically in swimming pools for an hour. It was chilly. It wasn't super cold. I mean 60 is not. It's not warm, but it's not ice-cold obviously. But an hour is ridiculous at some level. But the increases in dopamine were massive and lasted hours. So the mood enhancing effects that you report, you're not imagining that. Those are almost certainly a consequence of having slowly elevating but significantly elevated dopamine that goes on for hours. That's almost a dreamlike profile for dopamine. Because most everything else, like an Adderall or Ritalin, a cup of coffee and a pre-workout drink or something, is going to give you a big spike in adrenaline and dopamine and a big crash. And somehow, it creates this really nice, contoured profile. So whatever you're experiencing there is very nicely supported by the data. - Well, I need to get doing it more. I've had a couple of scary experiences going from hot to cold. - Can you explain? - Blood pressure changes, I think, where I basically went straight from a really hot jacuzzi. I was in there for like 30 minutes. I was doing heat stress. - Jacuzzi, okay. - Yeah, 104 degrees Fahrenheit. - That's toasty. - For 30 minutes, and then I went straight into, at the time, it was our pool, it was in February, it was wintertime, and it was 50. It was in the 50s. It was cold. And I was in there, and I was listening to Simon and Garfunkel, I was trying to stay in a long time, get on my cold, and I was trying to impress Dan 'cause he'll stay in there for like 15 minutes. - Wow. - But I started to feel really blinkey, like low blood pressure or something, and I got scared, so I got out, and then I couldn't stand, like I had vertigo or something, and I was so scared. I was so scared. And I've had a couple of times too where just going straight from the sauna to it, to the Cold Plunge, where I'm starting to feel, I'm like, ooh, I feel a little blood pressure change or something. It makes sense. The sauna is causing vasodilation and the Cold Plunge or cold exposure is causing vasoconstriction, so it's like a very just shock to my system. And so, now, I wait. I wait like a few minutes before going in. But I do need to kind of like make the cold more routine. Because I talk all about the science. I'm familiar with all the science, and the norepinephrine or noradrenaline, it's affecting brain and mood. You know way more about that than I do. I know how I feel, and I know it's a neurotransmitter, and it is released, at least, in rats, they've shown. Or was it mice? I think it might've been rats. But multiple studies showing that it's released from the cold in the brain. - And now, in humans as well. - Oh, in the brain, they've shown. - So, in that study, we could put a link to this, it's published in 2000 in European Journal of Physiology, that big dopamine increase. They also looked at epinephrine and cortisol and saw some really. Yeah, so this has been done. - They did brain. Oh- - Oh, no, no- - The plasma, yeah. Yes, plasma. - Very hard to measure dopamine directly from the brain unless you're doing microdialysis. No, unfortunately, unfortunately, their skulls were intact. Fortunately, for them, unfortunately, for the research community, their skulls were intact, so they couldn't measure directly in the brain. But obviously, there's a correlate there. It's a very real effect. But the advantage of not doing it too often"}

because that's one of the great benefits of sitting across from somebody who who did the work in detail so um yeah if you could tell us about your study um and uh what you did and what you discovered thank you for that question Andrew I I love to like also explain a little bit what did we do because when people read this kind of paper they just see the numbers they don't see what what happened before that and human studs are very different from from my study my study you can do a knockout of something and then everything is like perfectly matched and controlled doing human studies is very far different from that because people are different even in the groups so yeah but what we um when I started this research in 2016 I did not really know what the brown fat was so I started reading up on all this and I was very interested in preventive medicine um also the studies that I did before Brown fat was also like very much in in the preventive side like how can we that was about something else but the Sweet Tooth and how can we lower our sweet tooth and stuff like that so but after that I wanted to to do something new so I looked into the brown fat got highered in this fantastic research group where they it's a cell group so they mostly did cell studies and they didn't have anyone to do a human study yet um and um but they really wanted me to to do that so I read upon a lot of research about how does the brown fat get activated what have been done already and I mentioned the paper before with sleeping in the cold I found that particular paper very fascinating and that was also where um at that time I was like okay so cold exposure as an intervention of sleeping in the cold could be a good thing to go out and say well people do this but on the other hand is first of all it was already done that was one thing but the other thing was like well I wanted to to see if we can do like some kind of activity so we can have people move also or go and do something do something together or whatever and and and the code uh made us think about well what about winter swimming and it was kind of like a bit of a joke in the beginning it's like winter swimming yeah it's going to activate the brown fed right but but when we read the literature we couldn't really find anything about activation of the brown fat with cold water besides hand in a bucket of cold water that really that was already there so we were just thinking okay so it should be very potent um activation of the brown fat if it's cold water but very different from cold air so it was kind of also a new thing we were going into and uh we knew that we were going to do like a more of a um proof of concept study um at the beginning of it because it was like winter swimmers um must in theory activate the brown fat right but we kind of didn't really know was was this kind of stressor too much too little or what will happen actually but we had this idea about well we always say that cold water and winter swimming will activate your metabolism but do but do we know if it do does that no we don't so um and while this idea was a little bit fun fun at the beginning um we kind of accepted it was like okay let's just try this out but because we didn't have the funding for it we was like okay let's do a proof of concept study uh um let's go with a small number but enough to see um a difference between the groups so the power calculation of that study is done on uh what we know uh from pet C scannings of the brown fat so that's the main outcome of that of course so um and we wanted to go a little bit smaller on the numbers of of participants because we wanted to dig a little bit deeper into the different mechanisms and also redo some of the the dat so I really wanted to do that to see if I can replicate also the findings and that's going to take a lot of a lot of funding but it's also going to take a lot of time to do it um so the proof of concept was just going small but looking at different mechanisms we also took um fat biopsies for example and looked at the white fat to see if there was any differences between the groups before and after and stuff like that so that's kind of like how it started and and the first year was like a field study for me so I was not a winter swimmer when I started this it was just oh really no I wasn't um at all and I would say I was a bit afraid of the cold myself um bit of a cold always cold having big socks on and sweaters and stuff like that so I was like I am so comfortable I'm just like everybody else very comfortable I like being completely temperature neutral um but I started like playing with this thought like well if this is so healthy in theory I should not pack myself up I should start not doing that yeah but the first year observation of winter swimmers on the jetty they kind of joked about it say come on you need to try this you cannot study this unless you have tried it and I was like haha very funny of course I can do that but I couldn't I I read the literature I understood in theory what happens when you go into cold water but I completely understood it when I first tried it the first few times not so funny it felt painful it was just like running too long uh after a long break and you and your muscles hurt the day after right you you completely regret that you took that extra mile what about when you say uncomfortable you mean uncomfortable when you got in and when you were in or uncomfortable afterwards because I find that um on rare occasions well I should just full disclosure I I do deliberate cold exposure every morning for about a minute to two minutes in a cold plunge there are days that I miss but when I'm at home I do that and when I travel I do a cold shower I do finish with a warm shower so um and we'll talk about why that's probably not the best idea but um and I've been doing it for some years now um on and off uh but so just full disclosure I'm a devotee um and I have family members that uh hate the the cold but have gotten into it and and are starting to like it but they don't and I don't necessarily like the experience in the cold water but I love the way I feel when I get out and I have I'm 100% on that statement about loving it when I get out occasionally it feels good to be in there it feels invigorating and I think I've learned to control the gasp reflex and the hyperventilation and I just have told myself what we know which is that the forebrain struggles to engage for the first 20 or 30 seconds but if you can get past that wall it's it's far easier to to push through um but when you say that it was really uncomfortable do you mean the experience of getting in or you also felt lousy afterward yeah it's and very important to clear that out I only felt very uncomfortable doing it at the moment but afterwards the first time I went uh with with a group and actually my husband was there as well because I I really wanted someone I knew um coming alone because it's very normal if you haven't done this before you feel a little bit anxious about it didn't this is shown in studies as well because blood pressure and heart rate goes up in in those who are new to this kind of activity so um I was a little bit anxious about it so it was really uncomfortable just doing it but afterwards as soon as I got up I felt fantastic and we went into the SAA and I did three rounds because I just loved it I love the feeling afterwards because you have all these neutr transmitters going in your brain and you feel more positive you feel I feel invigorate I had so much energy uh and that like I I could totally see why people would do this to get energy throughout the day because I definitely had that I didn't have to do three dips to to get that I think one would be enough and I often do that also now today I do one dip sometimes I do two or three uh dips um in in one round you can say one day but uh often it's like just one or two times a week for me that is enough to to get that energy and to get that positive feeling and and I think that that is also why I I put up my study in that way I wanted to study the lowest dose you can say the lowest amount that we can get away with but still see um health benefits so what I observed there on the jetty was that some did it a long time they were in the water for a very long time and to me it seemed maybe a little bit extreme could you give me an example of long time well so maybe they were like really swimming and they could be 20 minutes or half an hour that's a long time that's a long time and there was like ice and people who came up I I mean I just didn't really feel that this is a something that I wanted to go out and recommend to people after my research subject dying either because if you're not adapted I mean people you know people can do that also a 20 minute cold shower or 20 minute cold plunge I know people do it but it's probably not a good idea no probably not it's going to exhaust your cells and a make them age too fast so exactly that's uh when you pass that htic stress this the healthy stress level that that's what is happening the quite opposite is it's a almost chronic stress actually in the cells well what"}
{"question": "How can I develop a strong inner dialogue that includes a conversation between multiple voices, allowing me to overcome self-doubt and achieve my goals?", "doc_id": "nDLb8_wgX50_23", "video_id": "nDLb8_wgX50", "video_title": "David Goggins: How to Build Immense Inner Strength", "video_header": "Inner Dialogue; Failing Properly", "segment_idx": "23", "time_start": "2:15:32", "time_end": "2:24:55", "context": "But I'm going to venture a hypothesis here. I think that you've mastered the process of internal dialogue. But when I say dialogue, I think most people think, oh, the inner voice, the chatter. But that's just one half of a dialogue. A dialogue is a two-way street. So I completely agree because I know from experience that when we go inward, oftentimes, we hear things, if we're really honest with ourselves, it's like, oh no, I don't want to think about that. No. And then we start looking outward. Or we start trying to shift our attention or distract. And there are a million reasons that are handed to us, excuses, and seemingly good justifications to be able to do that. But dialogue is a two-way street. And it hit me while you were just saying what you were saying, I was paying very close attention. And I realized David Goggins is talking about the voice that comes up, including the terrible stuff that no one wants to hear about themselves from themselves. But then he's also got the dialogue down where he knows the counter voice. He goes, yeah, you're right. And so I'm going to do this. Or maybe no, remember this. You're in a dialogue, a two-way dialogue in there, not a one-way chatter dialogue. There are books written by famous psychologists about chatter, trying to shift your internal narrative. You're like, bring the internal-- the internal narrative, that's what going inward is about. But it's not one voice. Again, there's a hypothesis. And I'm not claiming to be all-knowing. Lord knows I'm not all-knowing. But you've mastered the dialogue. And if there are three voices, strong, medium, and weak, in there, you're like, let's all come to the table. So you've got a symphony of voices in there that are all you, that you know to be you. And you know how to have those convers-- you're not afraid to be in those conversations. And then you know what the outcome of that committee decision is, and you put it into real-world action. And the world only sees the action. DAVID GOGGINS: That's it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And only you can know your internal dialogue. And only I can know my internal dialogue. And the only way to, quote unquote, \"know it\" is to spend a hell a lot of time there. DAVID GOGGINS: That's right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. DAVID GOGGINS: A lifetime. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it. DAVID GOGGINS: A lifetime. Like, think about it. For me to be sitting here in front of you, you're not going to call 300-pound Ecolab guy to come sit here. You might. I don't know. Maybe. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not. DAVID GOGGINS: Probably not. Think about this. What we teach people is kind, kindness to yourself. Do you think if I taught myself kindness-- and I agree with it. God, so many people-- so many people take me out of context, it's ridiculous. Take it however the fuck you want to take it. When I was 300 pounds, where do you think that conversation would that got me if I spoke kindness to myself? I'll tell you where it gets me. Right back to 7-Eleven with another box of mini chocolate donuts and a chocolate milkshake. That's the one voice. That's the one voice that most of us have that you're talking about. If you don't have a conversation in there, the other voice that you create that says, OK, how does this look? Looks very ugly. That kind conversation for me went away a long time ago, which is why the dialogue is now what you see. A lot of action. Because most people have inaction because there's one person talking. And that one person is always leading you down the same path, the path that makes you feel very comfortable and happy with yourself. The second you create the other voice, there's conflict. Just battles. Just wars. Just defeat. One thing I learned, and I taught myself this, and people go, I don't understand what you're saying, I'm going to try to break it down real quick. I didn't teach myself victory first. I taught myself failure. I taught myself how to fail. And people like, that's so depressing. Is it? When you're 300 pounds and you can't read and write and you're fucked up, you know how many times you're going to fucking fail on that process? So if you don't know how to fail, there is no victory. I never talked about winning because I knew the path to winning was going to be years of failing first. So I taught myself how to fail properly. No one teaches you how to fucking fail. But if you're going out for insurmountable fucking odds that make absolutely no fucking sense, a Black kid that can't swim, 300 pounds-- going to be a Navy SEAL. OK. You better teach yourself how to fail first because if you sit in failure for too long, you will never come out of it. So the first part of my success was learning how to fail properly. And then eventually, I started getting a few victories. But that's what people don't get. When you have buried yourself in such a deep fucking hole, you better first talk about the failures you're going to have first. And that's when that other voice comes up. It tells you, we've got to do something. But it also tells you, boy, I'm not going to lie to you, Goggins. You're in for a fucking climb, bro. You're going to get your ass handed to you, made fun of, the outside noise, the inside noise. Both voices are going to be fucking telling you to go fuck yourself. You are in for hell, bro. I am. So I better learn to fail. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So this is what you mean when you say that whatever anyone says, it's insignificant? DAVID GOGGINS: Insignificant as fuck. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's the cap gun fire because it's just like it-- because the voice in your own head is far worse. And I should say, sorry, one of the voices in your head. I'm being very detailed, almost surgical about that because I think this thing about inner dialogue we think is one voice. But you're making it clear it's many voices. DAVID GOGGINS: It is. And the thing about it is, you have to be really-- and sometimes all the voices are telling you the wrong shit, man. But through years, years, not a podcast or listening to a book or reading a book, years of sacrifice, of suffering, of diligent pinpoint fucking work on what you want to do for yourself, not like, oh, let me just do a bunch of shit. Let me-- I want to be in every task possible. No. Pinpoint what I want to do with my life. What happens is you have all these voices that are telling you you're fucked up, and this is going to be hard. But for some reason, you put so much practice into you that you can ignore every one of them that are telling you you're not going to fucking make it. And still be able to fucking make it because you have put the practice in that you know this is the process. It's such a daunting task that all the voices are saying no. But you still have the conviction that I know I can do this. And that's what it took for me to get here. 20, 30 years ago, I had this-- 35 or whatever it was, 25 years ago, pipe dream. And ever since then, every voice was like, you're a fucking nut. But when you put that practice in every day, you lace them up. And I mean, run. It's just a metaphor for life. When you lace them motherfuckers up every day, pretty soon, you win. Pretty soon, you'll fucking win. If you have the courage and the heart and the dedication and the mindset of everybody can go fuck themselves, I know what I know. I've listened to myself enough to know. I know what I know. None of you can hear what I'm hearing. And that's what people don't do enough of. They don't listen to their journey. They listen to everybody else's shit. Before you know it, I'm crazy. But if I'm so fucking crazy, why am I so successful? How that happen? But I'm so misguided and fucked up. And don't listen to him. Why am I the only one to do a whole bunch of shit? Why am I a trailblazer? Why? How is that possible? How can you be fucked up and also self-made at the same fucking-- no. No. Obviously, you're not looking at the truth in front of you. The truth in front of you is it sucks. It's painful. It's fucking mind-numbing. And that is the truth. And that's why a lot of people don't like listening to me because this is what it takes, creating another voice and sometimes going at it alone. All the time going at it alone because no one's going to believe in you. And that's that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: What I'm about to say is not conjecture."}

{"question": "Can iodine supplementation help reduce inflammation and associated health issues, such as heart disease and macular degeneration?", "doc_id": "x7qbJeRxWGw_12", "video_id": "x7qbJeRxWGw", "video_title": "How to Control Your Metabolism by Thyroid & Growth Hormone", "video_header": "Other Benefits of Iodine: Reducing Inflammation", "segment_idx": "12", "time_start": "39:01", "time_end": "40:55", "context": "they're related to thyroid, not directly, they're kind of offshoots of the thyroid pathway on their downstream of it, we would say, in terms of how they impact metabolic function. One of those is to reduce something called c-reactive protein. Some of you may have heard of CRP or c-reactive protein. C-reactive protein is something that you want to keep at modestly low levels. It's associated with inflammation and various forms of heart disease and even eye disease, macular degeneration. So it does appear that iodine supplementation or getting sufficient iodine from food, either works, is associated with reduced levels of c-reactive protein in the blood and an anti-inflammatory effect. And the anti-inflammatory effect brings us back to our old friend, interleukin 6. Remember, they're these inflammatory cytokines. They have many, many names because there are many, many of them. Interleukin 10 is the one that's anti-inflammatory. Interleukin 6 is the one that's inflammatory. Anytime you see IL-6, that usually means that there's an inflammatory response, there's a wound, there's inflammation of the brain, somebody is either sleep deprived or had a brain injury or they're dealing with some sort of infection. IL-6 is kind of a catch-all for inflammation. And it does appear that iodine supplementation can reduce circulating IL-6 associated with inflammation. So in that sense, iodine can have an anti-inflammatory effect. So by now, it should be abundantly clear. If you care about thyroid hormone, if you care about the pathways that it impacts like having a high level of metabolism, which I guess if for no other reason is attractive 'cause then you can eat more and still maintain a healthy body composition, but also for brain health, cognitive function, tissue repair, all that stuff, keeping c-reactive protein low, keeping IL-6 low, make sure you're getting enough iodine, selenium and L-tyrosine. If you're curious how thyroid actually increases the metabolism, allows you to eat more, et cetera. It relates to something we covered last issue,"}

I encourage you to check out this review it's available free as a download, we'll provide a link to it, you can get the full PDF if you want. But it does seem that women are better at detecting odors in these odor discrimination tasks than are men. And yes, that it does vary according to where they are in their menstrual cycle. And yes, they also looked at people who had received gonadectomy, they had their ovaries removed, a number of different important controls. None of this surprises me, none of this should surprise you, it's very clear that hormones have a profound effect on enlarge number of systems in our biology and that smell, and taste, and the ability to sense the chemical states of others, either consciously or subconsciously have a profound influence on whether or not we might want to spend time with them, whether or not this is somebody that we're pair bonded with, whether or not this is somebody that we just met and don't trust yet, things of this sort. And given what's at stake in terms of reproductive biology, not just offspring, but given the possibility of transmission of diseases, et cetera, you know, the risks of childbirth, et cetera. It makes so much sense that much of our biology is wired toward detecting and sensing whether or not things and people are things that we should approach or avoid, whether or not reproduction with that person is the appropriate response or suppression of the reproductive response is the appropriate response, right? As in that's the case with the tears. So, I think these are fascinating studies, it's an area that still needs a lot of work, but there are some really wonderful papers on this. And the one that I mentioned a few minutes ago, Sex Differences and Reproductive Hormone Influences on Human Odor Perception is one of the better reviews that are out there. There are also a number of other reviews for instance that talk about pheromone effects and their impact on mood, and sexual responses, and things of that sort, and we will also provide some links to those. A lot of this is still speculative, but I want to say I know I said it three times, what I really want to underscore because it is vitally important, and people seem to get a little triggered by the notion of pheromones. Just because we haven't identified the actual chemical compound that's acting as a pheromone or putative pheromone"}

and the most rapid rate of Aging that we ever experience is puberty I mean just fundamentally brain circuits that were for one thing or that were dormant change and come alive in ways that the world forever will look different to us feel different to us and our self-perception changes period it's something that biologists still understand at the level of hor hormes and hypothalamic circuitry but that um has really not been matched to a psychological understanding and vice versa so um like nothing is quite like the music you listen to when you're a teenager it like it brings you back the memories you form positive and negative stamp down boom now and forever the emotional salience can change but those are wild years what are some of the more critical needs of late adolescents and teens that you know are actionable um yeah you know and yeah I mean I'm just mean my teen years were were crazy but um even if they're less crazy they're always crazy yes yes so and one of the reasons I think at least in America that adolescence has seen a such a huge shift like my kid is out of control they're always out they're like always rejecting me I don't think is unrelated to the behavioral control approaches that are inherent in American parenting cuz like you referred to your kid becomes 14 and they kind of realize like wait I'm bigger than one of my parents like I literally don't care about their sticker charts anymore and we might have missed 14 years of building a relationship and so what that kid's adolescence is going to look like is markedly different than if for those past 14 years you weren't giving into everything no but you were leading in a sturdier more connected way so I really think this whole idea that American adolescence like reject everything I actually think not all of it a part of it is completely developmentally normal but a big part of it relates to this tradition of Behavioral control that kids cannot reject until they're at the age that they kind of could survive on their own which is adolescence so I think that's really important the things I would tell parents to really keep in mind that are critical number one is related to that like a teen's job is to separate and to start to form their own identity and I think there's a couple things about that parents need to know number one like I don't think we prepare parents enough for the true sense of loss they feel when their kids are adolescence because that's very real like you've just spent all these years and like you've driven them to every soccer and they kind of talk you in the back seat and maybe you have family movie nights and then all of a sudden they don't want any of that and it's just so important parents to know like I'm I'm going to feel sad I'm going to feel lost and if we don't know to expect it we often kind of Infuse that into a lot of anger toward our kid um and so I just think that's normal and we should talk about that more and parents of adolescent need to be talking about that with each other of course you miss that that's totally normal um number two related to that separation if you think about identity formation right like here's a kid and us and we're kind of close and they now we're at the stage we devel mentally their job at that stage just to figure out who they are they have to overcorrect like you have to kind of overcorrect in the amount of space you take because it's really the only way you can figure out like wait maybe I do want to take parts of that that part's okay and so I think that's like a powerful image to think about like they are moving far away that distance they take from you is not their final point they will move closer now going back to loss not as close as they used to be and that is different but that's not that's this is their way of trying to figure out who they are then the last thing I'd say that kind of relates that image it's like even as they move away I think parents massively underestimate how much they still need us they making efforts to connect and I always think like the difference in like an Explorer and a nomad is whether or not you have a home base and like if our teens feel like Nomads is not a good situation they're explorers they try a million different things but like they they really really do need us they they need to know that they have a home and um I'll never forget my private practice I I used to work with teens not that long ago just the teen sometimes the parents too and this teen came to me and this was extreme she had been um really in a in a in a bad place with her parents like intense intense conflict and um they got in this huge fight and she was really really upset and she was describing this to me she's like and then I was like get out of my room get out I hate you get out you know and I was just like sitting there listening and and then she like she I push him out I slam the door and was a couple minutes later open the door my heart's racing can you believe they weren't there can you believe they weren't there and to me it was just this like and again it's not about being a punching bag but I like under like her seeming anger and her like intense pain we're so close together in her own story that it's just over and over the same thing like they're going to reject you they're going to say get out of my room and yes it sucks but they want you to slip a note under their door after you've taken a couple minutes it says that was really tough or like wow that got out of control you're a good kid and I love you and I wanted to tell parents of teens you're going to do that there's going to be a pause and then you will will hear them rip up the note you will and like I swear to any parent that that still resonated and your kid is again trying to figure out how do I stay close with my parents and I'm figuring out my own who I am so like they rip up the note because like they almost like have to do it to like take in how much they're still desperate for those bids for connection sounds a lot like um the Dynamics of adult relationships although hopefully hopefully with a little bit less um dramatic uh accentuation um but you know even if it does I mean it's like these um these circuits that are laid down in childhood Early Childhood they persist right I mean I think if anything's become clear to me in understanding brain development and brain function it's that you know we don't discard circuitry for attachment and go oh you know that was for Mom and this one was for Dad and that one was for the dog and um and then the Romantic relationship is different we repurpose the circuits hence all the beautiful work on childhood attachment that's now being translated to adult attachment I mean I realize there's Nuance to it but you know I was um reflecting a bit on this again incredibly potent um phrase or mention of explorers versus Nomads of having a home base and thinking about uh these psychology experiments where children are observed in the presence of their caretakers sometimes the strange situation t where people are SE kids are separated from their moms and mom um and child typically mom nowaday it's also been done with other caretakers and dads reunite but one doesn't even have to know about those experiments all you have to do is go to a park or be out in public and see a little toddler venturing away from parent and then what do they do every once in a while they look back they're just trying to check to make sure they're there even the kids that are like taking off on the tricycle like crazy yes will eventually stop and look back it's like this fundamental circuit we're looking back you know and how far they feel they can go is in direct relationship to presumably the number of times that they recharged that they re that they recharge and were able to see that uh that verification that the parent was still there I think this notion of explorers versus Nomads and um being an Explorer obviously being a good thing a healthy thing um within reason um and Nomads just feeling a drift untethered yes you know one of the one of the scariest words at least to me in the um in the English language"}

Storytelling", "segment_idx": "18", "time_start": "1:51:12", "time_end": "1:58:55", "context": "ground truths of of Art and of magic and how they they overlap because what we're really talking about here are ways in which the brain works stories and this restraining exaggeration I'll just share two two things um I'll try and keep it brief um one is that again Rick Rubin um incredibly uh uh virtuoso in at the level of creativity and bringing out People's Best in in terms of Music other domains too um but mostly music um often says that you know that the art has to have some recognizable feature like this is this artist that people have perhaps heard before but then something new but you can't completely depart from what was done before there has to be some recognition um you also talked about wiping away of using a completely new canvas this example you gave um when Rick came to our studio here he looked around and he go I like this place he's very into physical spaces and uh the walls here are black there's some other stuff too he and he said uh you know well cuz both Rick and I came up through punk rock music he's like yeah I think a smaller place black wall I was like cool um his studio is mostly white and but then he said you know but I'd get rid of all the art and the plants and I said why and he said because it's distracting you know he doesn't have art or Awards on his walls it's all blank so that every new project is a completely new project there's no it's interesting previous stimula entering the picture it's a new project so you don't want pictures of awards that you won for that album or anything I go what do you do with all that stuff and he's like just get rid of it like me too by the way I I I I totally understand that very interesting So Clean Slate then the the other thing that just is is so striking to me is you know this idea that there has to be something that is a truth a a a mathematical or a physical truth present in art um one of the best ways that one can understand how the brain creates perceptions is that um the brain creates abstractions of what's out in the outside world light sound touch smell taste come in but that's all translated to electrical and chemical signals and then the brain reconstructs an image by the way the lens of the eye you'll find this interesting as a photographer inverts and reverses the image so that when it lands in the brain the neural retina first stage of visual processing you're actually I'm looking at you you're right side up but you're actually landing on my the the the perception in my brain is that you're upside down and flipped I am and then now you got me you had me for a second um I am too um uh so and then the brain reconstructs an upright image it's really wild so the brain is constantly abstract making abstractions about what's out there so if I were to say um take a photograph of you and show you a picture of your face you'd say yeah that's me but if I said aha but I'm an abstract artist and to me you look like and I basically do a bunch of squiggles and a thing and and I show you it doesn't look anything like your face you'd say yeah I don't see it however if I somehow have the artistic genius which I don't to create an image of you where the eyes are distorted their position or maybe the the shading something is different in a way that lets you see and other people see your face in a way that is similar enough to AI wind that we recognize you but different enough that it looks interesting we're effectively creating the kind of abstraction that the brain creates like some level of interest in an emotion or in a um something right a reflection in your eye could be who knows right and so the brain is an abstraction machine it doesn't actually know what's out there it's taking best guesses and so I think when when we see great art it's able to capture enough of the real physical truth of that thing but to touch into some of the ways in which the brain abstracts I'll give one more example rothos which are simply to some people who don't like them I love rothos are simply color on canvas but Rothco whether or not he intended it or not did something absolutely spectacular with his art which was he eliminated the white space and the canvas and in doing so was able to allow things to come forward in color space as we call in visual Neuroscience certain colors are not visible unless they are adjacent to other colors and when you eliminate all the white space the canvas and you take away the frame then colors that you haven't seen before and color transitions that you can't see Pop and that's the Brilliance of a Rothco it's not that it's two colors in a square and a rectangle and you know this is why they're worth millions and millions of dollars they're they're so spectacular because they capture a physical truth about color space that's inaccessible in a framed painting or a painting that includes some visibility of the canvas so rotho shows us color space the math of how the brain produces color contrast and Hue and wavelength intensity and color is also intimately tied to value in the brain in a very interesting way and we're not looking at it thinking all that but we feel something that's like if we appreciate Roth goes like hm that's interesting that captivates me does that make sense yeah yeah no I have a question to you do we do we know that Roth did it through that lens of understanding science you just described or did he just intuitively felt this is a great composition these are a great color scheme and I will do that like what do we know it's most most likely the latter yeah um I have a colleague Beville Conway who's at the National Institutes of Health who's far more versed in this stuff than I am so he might correct me I'd love to get him on the podcast sometime um but uh Co it's very likely that Rothco felt something upon seeing colors in a in a restricted kind of tunnel of vision and then realize that if this could be brought to scale because rothos tend to be pretty large then and um something special was happening sort of like Chuck Close took tiny little images of faces and now he had a visual issue with faces prop agosia Etc so people can look that up failure to recognize faces as faces um they just look like objects and realize that he could create you know composits of these things as a big face and it's very different experience to look at a a face that's made up of tiny fragments of many many faces now now here's where it gets interesting because there are many many artists that sit out in front of museums like the met and sell paintings that are very inexpensive that are very accurate Renditions of things picture of Taylor Swift picture of Bob Marley not interesting it's cool they can do it or the the real you know the kind of um uh uh you know curbside trickery take a painting paint in front of people what's what's he or she doing and then flip it over it's the person it's cool in the moment CU you're like wow they can paint upside down but actually it's not interesting at all because what they've created is BAS basically a decent photograph image just upside down so they might as well hang upside down while they do it it's not interesting it's not great art so what I think what we're converging on is that great art takes us through a trajectory that involves the I believe now after this discussion that takes us through the Arc of excellent storytelling it involves a surprise recognition of truth a return to mystery all these components that you describe for magic are present in art and presumably are present in a great song as or play as well yeah you"}

them into a single question and eventually I did and it's this for many people they associate the creative process with disorganization I think what's so striking about you is that you embody both the creative process but also a strong sense of organization around it like nothing seems hairbrained or like random or halfhazard about anything that you do and yet for a lot of people who call themselves creatives they they'll say I'm a creative this that and you'll look at the space they're in and it's like chaos or they or their life is kind of chaos not all of them but is what I'm saying making sense because I think why people Orient toward you and one of the reasons for your success with the creative process is that you're extremely organized but but not to the point of being rigid are you willing to embellish a little bit on that perception whether or not it's accurate inacurate say there's a part in the process early on where it is before it can get organized where it's free and it's playful and it can be chaotic um it's just not the it's a byproduct of whatever is happening it it's not it's good because it's chaotic and it's it just happens to be sometimes chaotic in that in that experiment in the beginning where we're really playing with this idea of of having fun and creating stimulation and seeing how it makes us feel and we try a lot of we could try wacky things to get there um but then when it happens when you get that that feeling of like oh this is interesting I haven't seen this before then it gets more um controlled but it starts in a very free place and I I I don't know if I would really use the word chaotic but it could be I it certainly wouldn't be wrong I would say more free would be the word free like no um no expectation and total immersion in like an improvisation that you're participating in that can go wherever it wants to go and you're cool allowing it to go wherever it wants to go and sometimes when it goes somewhere dangerous that's when it gets interesting so the the I can understand that that danger aspect maybe that's why I like pro wrestling I don't know but there's something about when you get to this these edges where this is not for everybody it can get very interesting speaking of um stuff that's not for everybody and that to some people might have been shocking I remember hearing Ghetto Boys for the first time and like whoa like they're taking certain things pretty far when you're working with an artist and they venture out into that place where things are like maybe even a little shocking what is that feeling for you internally like is it how do you distinguish between shock value for its own sake and something that's really opening up a new creative Avenue or Insight like like how do you do you recall the first time you you heard like Bushwick and those guys do their thing yeah what what was your internal narrative I can't believe it I can't believe what they're saying it's really um pushing the boundaries of what anyone has said in this music before it had switched because the the original in originally in rap there was a lot of boasting about themselves bragging and then we got to uh the message happened and there was some social commentary then there was gangster rap and then the Ghetto Boys took a version of gangster rap and turned it into horror rap which was much more graphic than gangster rap gangster rap was talking about a um a real life situation whereas the Ghetto Boys took it into horror movie territory it was more fantasy um but it seemed really scary at the time in the way that a you're scared at a great horor movie do you like horror movies I don't do you like monster movies to where you know it's not real like it's impossible uh as opposed to horror movies where you know it's um you know people getting killed by another human like stuff that could happen in the world versus um you know monsters and zombies and that kind of thing I don't think I really like either of them very much I like things that make me feel good I don't really like adrenaline you know I don't like to be excited for some reason in audio I like something that makes me excited but in visuals I tend not to like things that make me excited interesting and you're able to kind of clean yourself of experiences easily right like it seems like if you listen to something it's really shocking you don't carry that shock to your sleep or to the next day like it doesn't trouble you but a movie can can impact me like there was a movie called Melancholia that I saw years ago Lars vont Trier movie and I thought it was a very beautiful movie but I was in a bad mood I would say for 3 months from the time I watched that movie on it just like did something to my brain that didn't feel good and it couldn't snap out of it so interesting there there are a few movies that have done that to me the movie Blue Valentine which has done really well um which is with uh Ryan goling and someone else where um it's a relationship I won't explain what happens in The Arc of the relationship but it just like the movie Haunted me m there's one scene where he's wearing a misfit shirt and I was like I like the and that's a a particularly good scene where he's singing to her um but the rest of the movie just brings about such feelings of like just how hard life can be sometimes and how misguided people can be in relationship and it it's interesting how movies can just kind of embed in us it's not pleasant I don't want to talk about it anymore there were a number of

{"question": "What role do nutrition, sleep, and social connection play in supporting the recovery from fear and trauma, and how can they be used as foundational elements to enhance mental and physical health?", "doc_id": "31wjVhCcI5Y_20", "video_id": "31wjVhCcI5Y", "video_title": "Erasing Fears & Traumas Based on the Modern Neuroscience of Fear", "video_header": "Nutrition, Sleep, & Other General Support Erasing Fear & Trauma", "segment_idx": "20", "time_start": "1:59:42", "time_end": "2:02:29", "context": "So just very briefly, I want to touch on some of the lifestyle and supplementation factors that can impact things like fear and trauma and getting over fear and trauma. To make a long story short. There are many things that we all can and should do to support our overall mental and physical health. And these are the foundational elements of quality nutrition. What that means to you? Quality sleep on a regular basis, ample sleep on a regular basis. We have an episode on how to master sleep in bed. We have four episodes that you can go to hubermanlab.com or elsewhere and scroll down and you can find those episodes in order to get your sleep really dialed in as they say. If you're sleeping regularly and for sufficient duration, all of the systems of your fear circuitry are going to function better. Mainly because the autonomic nervous system becomes very dysregulated when we are not getting good sleep on a regular basis. Dysregulated means that out of nowhere we can have a higher propensity to have sympathetic activation or we can feel really tired and wired. That seesaw that I described earlier of alertness and calmness of sympathetic and parasympathetic. In that analogy we can imagine that seesaw has a hinge and that hinge can neither be too tight nor too loose. If it's too tight, you can get locked into chronic activation of alertness or chronic fatigue. If it's too loose, you're bouncing all over the place and you might be tired and wired one moment and then really hyper alert. Sleep resets that balance and resets that hinge to the appropriate tightness, if you will. So that all these circuits and not just the circuits related to fear but also the circuits related to cognition, clear thinking to be able to spell out very clear detailed narratives, to feel like you are in control. You are deliberately bringing yourself into these protocols if that's what you intend to use. All of that functions much better when you're sleeping well and eating well. We talked about social connection. Those are all indirect supports of trauma relief and of getting over fear but they are essentia, okay? I think of them sort of like the tide. When the tide is high enough a boat can leave harbor. And if the tide is not high enough, then that boat is going to be stranded on shore. And in this analogy, the boat stranded on shore is your attempt or anybody's attempt to try and work through something. Very hard to do when we're sleep deprived, very hard to do when we're not fed enough or fed the proper foods for you. And that's a highly individual thing. And social connection as we talked about earlier, creates a general sense of support for the ability to move through things. But also chemical support at the level of suppressing Tachykinin, okay? So those foundational elements are absolutely key, but they are indirect. I just want to briefly mention a few of the things that some people find great benefit from"}

You mentioned that one breath can shift your brain state and that itself can be powerful. I think that's absolutely true. You've also talked about 30 minute breathwork practices, which is 30 minutes of breathwork, is a pretty serious commitment I think, but it's doable. Certainly a zero cost, except for the time in most cases. What do you see out there in the landscape of breathwork that's being done that you like, and why do you like it? What do you think you, or what would you like to see more of in terms of exploration of breathwork and what do you do? - Well, I'm a relatively new convert to breathwork. Through my own investigation of it, I became convinced that it's real, and I'm basically a beginner in terms of my own practice. And I like to keep things simple, and I think I've discussed this before. I liken it to someone who's a couch potato who was told they got to begin to exercise. You don't go out and run a marathon. So, couch potato, you say, okay, get up and walk for five minutes and 10 minutes. And then, okay, now you're walking for a longer period. You'll begin to run, and then you reach a point, you say, well, gee, I'm interested in this sport. And there may be particular kinds of practices that you can use that could be helpful in optimizing performance of that sport. I'm not there yet. I find I get tremendous benefit by relatively short periods between five and maybe 20 minutes of doing box breathing. It's very simple to do. I have a simple app, which helps me keep the timing. - Do you recall which app it is? Is it the Apnea Trainer? Is that the one? - Well, I was using Calm for a long time, but I let my subscription lapse and I have another one whose name I don't remember but it's, so it's very simple and it works for me. I'm now trying this Tummo, because I'm just curious and exploring it because it may be acting for a different way and I want to see if I respond differently. So, I don't have a particular point of view. Now, I have friends and colleagues who are into particular styles like Wim Hof. And I think what he's doing is great and getting people who are interested. I think the notion is that I would like to see more people exploring this and to some degree, as you point out, 30 minutes a day, some of the breath patterns that some of these stars like Wim Hof are a little intimidating to newbies. And so, I would like to see something very simple, that what I tell my friends is, look, just try it five or 10 minutes. See if you feel better, do it for a few days. If you don't like it, stop it, it doesn't cost anything. And invariably, they find that it's helpful. I will often interrupt my day to take five or 10 minutes. Like, if I find that I'm lagging... I think there's some pretty good data that your performance after lunch declines. And so, very often what I'll do after lunch, which I didn't do today is take five or 10 minutes and just sort of breath practice. - And lately, what does that breath practice look like? - It's just box breathing for five to 10 minutes. - And the duration of your inhales and holds and exhales and holds is set by the app? Is that right? - Well, I do five seconds. - So, five seconds inhale, five second hold, five second, exhale, five second hold. - Yeah, and sometimes I'll do doubles. I'll do 10 seconds just because I get bored. It's just, I feel like doing it and it's very helpful. I mean... Now, that's not the only thing I do with respect to trying to maintain my sanity and my health. - No, I can imagine there'd be a number of things, although, because you seem very sane and very healthy, I in fact, know that you are both of those things. - Right, you suspect that I am. - I suspect that there's data. Awhile back we had a conversation, a casual conversation, but you said something that really stuck in my mind,"}

in other words if I've got the best blue light filter in the world on my phone but I'm doom scrolling social media and getting lit up on email that's way worse for me than if I've got my phone on maximum light and I'm like watching YouTube videos of F1 cars and driving around having fun like it's a totally different experience so so so the context matters and um I think I think for that reason I I I would want people to be mindful of the whole picture um you know going to bed under a period of you know intense duress brought on by something you know that's an equally dangerous component to all of this that's that's distinct from what we're talking about but but you know you just want i' like I want people to be able to think of this in the context of everything yeah I it's a really important point you know one thing I'll say is that if you're going to stay up past your normal bedtime if you're going to get a lot of light in your eyes I would hope that it would be for fun reasons and for reasons you enjoy you should definitely spend some nights out you should definitely do some all nighters studying if you really you know if you if it's going to help you get the grade that's permanent right I'd certainly have done all nighter studying and grant writing for years um you know there are going to be the inevitable allnighters due to God forbid a Hos trip to the hospital or you heard something on the news that really amped you up or you just simply can't sleep that stuff is going to happen so I think the goal should be to minimize light exposure at night and I think what you just said is especially true because we don't know for instance people talk about the negative impact of social media is it the fact that people are looking at this little box for so many hours per day is it all the things they're not doing is it what they're looking at per se all of those things interact and are really important I we know based on studies from the Stanford sleep lab that if you wake up in the middle of the night looking at what time it is can be very disruptive to your ability to fall back asleep and to your sense the next day it's just a placebo effect but it's a powerful one of how tired you are the next day they've done this where they wake people up in the middle of the night and then they say it's you know 4:00 a.m. versus 2: a.m. versus 6:00 a.m. and people's perceived levels of energy during the day in some ways correlate with what they think how much sleep they think they got likewise and this is one of the concerns potential concerns with sleep trackers yep Ali Crum talked about this when she came on our podcast you know if people see a poor sleep score they often feel worse than if they see a good sleep score now of course physiology matters you can't lie to yourself and say you you know got a great night of sleep simply by virtue of a sleep score but I worry more about the the false well I if it's a false negative that we don't want to put veilance on this seeing a bad sleep score and then deciding that you're going to have a terrible day you know I think a bad sleep score is an indication that you might need to dial some things in a bit better getting a great sleep score is an indication that you might be doing a number of things right and start looking at these things as averaging wouldn't would you agree yeah completely I I I I don't think it's that different from CGM right like I think that CGM is an amazing tool to provide insight and you pretty much know the insights after a relatively short period of time 30 days maybe at the outside 90 for for a really per for a person with a very complicated life um and you know all you need to know about how the inputs affect the output thereafter if you choose to use it it's a behavioral tool in other words you're using this to build in a Hawthorn effect I think the same is largely true with sleep trackers um most people have this profound sense of learning when they first encounter one of these things and and it's again you've heard it all 100 times oh my God I can't believe what alcohol does to my sleep right or caloric trackers exactly like I think a lane Norton's app carbon I have no Financial relationship to it I use it or and it's taught me wow like I consume a lot of calories in the form of certain things at certain times of day and there's just a lot of good learning in that but it's the Act of tracking that helps you manage it and similarly I think it's the act of knowing you're going to be looking at that score that gamifies it that kind of helps people do the right things oh you know what I'm not going to have that drink tonight or I'm not going to eat that snack before bed because I've now been conditioned to see how that impact score that said I think that um you know recovery scores and things like that are just notoriously poor at predicting performance and I think there's a reason that serious athletes would never

theory playing out in the real world but also um kind of like no deep Notions of the human Spirit like we are a species that um seems to organize our experience in terms of of stories of ourselves and others but that um when it comes to things like strivings and learning um are really always in a constant state of either being more to borrow the words of a friend of mine either back on our heels flat footed or forward Center of mass right um and what we're talking about today is being forward Center of mass at least in certain areas of life I mean that the fact that the reward systems of the brain where you mentioned them earlier these misol liic reward Pathways that basically deploy dopamine um and other things of course um are so associated with striving and achieving striving and achieving and presumably underly much if not all of our human evolution assuming we're still evolving lately sometimes I wonder but um some people would argue we're Devol devolving but I I would argue we're still evolving um especially with this new burst in AI it's all about math nowadays folks a few years ago it all about neuroscience and Neuroscience is still really important and the two share but it's all about math lately um so I I like to just think of the human animal as so different than the other animals of the planet like we're the curators of the planet the house cats might be striving but they're clearly not doing as well as we are in terms of managing the way the world goes so what do you think that this is like a basic um algorithm within human beings to look at ourselves look at the environment see challenges overcome challenges develop Technologies it's just kind of like a a it's like the same way my bulldog used to like to gnaw on things you know you like to chew and pull we just want to learn and grow do you do you think it's inherent to who we are as a species maybe even what sets our species apart from all the others I mean that's that's a profound question I think that's that's a good one to debate that what what I've been really taken by recently is Carol dak's Secret Life as a neuroscientist she has this great psych review paper that contradicts a lot of received wisdom about prefrontal planning regions of the brain and the kind of amydala and the hippocampus the you know the affective regions and the memory creation regions and the the classic argument and going back to Plato and the FIS right is that the rational acting part of the brain plans out what it wants makes all these calculations and then has to tame the emotional part in order to make those goals into a reality and so the emotion you know the amydala the mesolimbic that's this unruly horse that the Chariot has to harness you know and I think that Carol argued and I think other people have argued too I've I've seen Adriana Galvan and Rond doll and others argue this that um the affective regions are often the teacher and the prefontal is the student and that makes sense if you think about how humans are goal directed think about how a kid learns to walk they don't do that for theoretical reasons they don't just like look at people walking and be like I want to learn how to do that right it's I have four kids it's usually because there's a toy at the other side of the room that they really really want and that I don't want them to have and the only way for them to go get it because I won't get it for them is for them to learn how to walk so the the motor learning is the effect of the desire in the goal Pursuit and what what Carol argued is that feder's had is totally wrong it's not that the prefrontal charioteer is taming the emotional it's really that the the affect part is training the prefrontal to be better at pursuing the goals that matter in the social millu that you have and a lot of people like um Adriana Galan and Jen feifer and Nim Tottenham in the Adolescent space have shown this and I don't understand all the details fully but the the argument that I've heard is that once the scanning studies were able to switch from fmri focused on simple activation to studies looking at connectivity then they and where you could get temporal ordering then you could start seeing actually that especially in adolescence it's the the affective regions are training or teaching or telling the prefrontal regions what to do so I guess the the that's a long way of answering the question of I think that I think goal Pursuit is fundamental to Human Nature and I think that the brain and our adaptation is designed to help us learn how to be a lot better at pursuing whatever goals will help us survive in our environment and the brain has to be adaptive to that environmental input because the environment's always changing if it had only one way of pursuing its goals then we would never survive so it has to be the case that the planning rational observing part of the brain is actually responsive to what works in your context for goal Pursuit so again I'm summarizing other people's here but that's how I that's how I see it yeah I completely agree that emotions Drive the more um let's call tactical circuitry of the prefrontal cortex of course we should be fair to the the Neuroscience the prefrontal cortex is part of the lyic system people often think because it's in the cortex it's higher order and um that's simply not true but um well if we both agree and it sounds like we do that emotions Drive tactical decisions that drive action and learning"}

don't think I've ever had a teenager I've got some NBA players that are 19 20 21 so maybe those count but uh those are men obviously but for nutritional testing that would be potentially a helpful thing to do in your 20s becomes less important as you get older and you develop more micronutrient deficiencies but micronutrients play a huge role in terms of hormone production magnesium you know the Magnesium is hugely involved in the way that you get rid of estrogen as an example so micronutrient testing what I usually do is a combination of blood and urine and so I'm looking at all of the micronutrients that we can measure that have some clinical scientific basis behind them if I could do that for a teenager I think it might be helpful because I recently gave a lecture on breast cancer RIS reduction another quick sidebar and I was sad to find that intake of vegetables polyphenols is such an important predictor of future risk of breast cancer like when you're 50 60 plus and the most important time is when you're a teenager now I have one daughter that eats vegetables she loves them and I have another daughter who eats food that's beige and it's very hard to get her to eat the volume of vegetables you know five colors a day which is what I do and if you have evidence that you could show a 17-year-old that they've got micronutrient gaps I think that would be a motivator for them to eat differently at a time when it's so critical even though it's you know 25 years in the future that it's going to potentially change this Arc that they're on what do you do for a young woman who doesn't like vegetables is or is not somehow able or willing to to get those five colors a day of vegetable to help support the microbiome you know are supplements a useful tool in that case um what other sorts of tools Behavioral or otherwise are useful such a good question so here I'm going to invoke Rob Knight at UCSD so I think his his uh his gut project has really been helpful in terms of understanding what kind of modulators are going to be important so what I try to get that person to do and I don't see many teens anymore other than NBA players what I try to get them to do is to have a smoothie very hard to get them to have a smoothie every day but if I could get them to have a smoothie three times a week and to throw some of these vegetables in that makes a huge difference I mean we know that makes a difference in terms of microbiome change she be blending up broccoli or kale cauliflower so cauliflower great even they're putting things into the Smoothie yeah I don't know if you can get a teenager to do that but they often will use like I have them do steamed broccoli that's in the freezer because it's got very little taste so that they could do that in a chocolate smoothie they could add some greens I like greens powders are was super convenient so that with you know kind of a a taste that they like whether that's chocolate which is what most of my clients want or you know vanilla with berries and that sort of thing so that can go a long way if you don't like vegetables and short of that I would say some supplements but I would say that's a distant second to making a smoothie I've got one patient that I have to mention because um he took this to the extreme so he's a retired physicist professor at UCSD he found out that his microbiome was a hot mess and um developed autoimmune disease and so he became hellbent like only a physicist could on changing his microbiome and he dramatically shifted it by having a smoothie every day with 57 vegetables and fruits in it 57 independent 57 independent so I mean this just warms my heart the way that he did this but he would go to the farmers market he would just get a bunch of this a bunch of that and he would go home make the smoothie and then stick it in the freezer so he'd have a serving every day and he became a completely different person based on this microbiome change his uh autoimmune disease is in remission he um he dropped a huge amount of weight he went from being you know kind of this phenotype that I know you know well of a professor High performing traveling around the world on so many boards so much Innovation so many great ideas super computer guy to being someone who gets up in the morning gets in his hot tub EX exercises for like 1 to two hours a day and then does a little work like he completely shifted the way that he lives and his microbiome shift you know who knows what what's the chicken and what the what's the egg there but he had a huge change in his physiology glucose went from being quite high he had and he tracks all of this of course it's like on S after all right and retired I suppose might have had and he's retired but he's he's got the Longest Time

that I do in the book um so now this is actually the perfect time for us to switch over to the four recommendation the four main recommendations because they build exactly on what you just said they help me explain why this is so important so um so you know I think one one reason why the book seems to be doing very well and people seem to like and pass it on is that it's not just Doom and Gloom it's not just oh we've messed up our kids oh these terrible devices um rather it's about a vision of childhood which is actually beautiful it's the one that that most of us older people had it's with play outdoors and all um and and so the um my analysis in the book is that the reason why I got this far is because it's a set of collective action traps everyone every 10-year-old needs a smartphone now because every other 10-year-old has one and you don't want to make your kid be alone so the four recommendations I have are four ways of breaking out on the Trap but the first two are really about delaying and getting past this period of plasticity and you really help me see why it's so urgent to delay until late puberty at least so here are the four Norms that I think can break us out of this trap Norm number one uh no smartphone before high school you can give your kid a flip phone flip the Millennials had flip phones they came out fine no access or no smartphone of their own your own you can't have your own and that would even go for an iPad if you give your kid an iPad and say here Billy this is your iPad you can keep it in your room and use it any you know anywhere in the house and you can take it outside even although maybe no W Wi-Fi whatever the point is um the internet is an amazing thing and you know you can have a computer in your living room or kitchen when you have young kids and they can do things on the computer but you do not want to give your child the entire internet in his or her pocket and you do not want the entire world to be able to reach your child whenever they want to so it's just insane that we're giving children even before puberty a smartphone let them have a flip phone or a simple phone watch something like that that's rule number one rule number two is the most relevant for what we're just talking about and that is no social media until 16 there is I believe no way to make social media safe for children that is if they're going to be entering a domain in which Prestige is gained by having posts that get the most likes and followers you're making them be brand managers you're making them be performative this is not playful they're going to be exposed to horrible horrible things I now ask young people is there something that you saw when you were young that you really regret seeing and a lot of them have an answer uh my 21-year-old Dorman just told me about the gauntlet uh running the gauntlet it's a series of 20 videos it's a challenge can you watch these 20 videos which end with you know a Mexican drug gang dismembering a person who's alive things like that like yes I'm tough enough I can do that really at what age should you do you want your kids watching people being dismembered 10 11 is that and those images are forever for that's right that's right I didn't even watch the video I you know what I'm sorry I said that I we provide a link no I'll say that you know trauma is defined as a adverse event that forever changes the way the brain responds in ways that make people less effective in life so don't do it to yourself like I wouldn't watch the Dalmer movie everyone was talking about the Dalmer movie all I had to see was 10 seconds of the trailer to know I'll pay money not to see that not because I couldn't through it I'm sure I could force myself to but I don't want that in my neural real estate right it's just they're for right for obvious reasons so so let's go back to what you said about neuroplasticity so because if if it's true that puberty is a sensitive period for many higher level uh uh aspects of our Humanity such as identity relationship skills all that stuff then you should be extra careful when your kids are 9 to 15 years old you should be extra careful about what's going into their eyes and ears and instead that's when we give up all control you know when our kids are little they pay attention to us we read to them we have a lot of control about what our kids consume when they're toddlers And when they're very young but as they reach middle school and high school they're moving away they're seeking out other stuff and that's exactly what we say here here's your own device you want to go down a rabbit hole of eating disorder stuff you want to go down a rabbit hole of of you know of you know Tourette Syndrome um you're going to copy people who have these symptoms so the last thing we should be doing is exposing our children in this sensitive period to socializing information from random weirdos on the internet who were selected by an algorithm for the extremity of their behavior and the degree to which that extremity earned them likes which makes them extra prestigious um so yeah I laws that raise the age to 16 or 18 I think that's what we need um this is just not appropriate for minors even if there's some good stuff on it I think it's vastly outweighed by the bad so that's and that's the second Norm no smart no social media till 16 uh the third Norm is phone free schools and again you know if we expect kids to learn and learning is brain change if you're learning something you're developing a skill something about your brain has changed uh how about instead of learning math or reading or litter or anything else how about if you just do more phone stuff you just spend more time in school on Tik Tok there was just an article in the Washington in the Wall Street Journal about a teacher who fought against the phones and finally gave up and quit and one of the students in his classes quoted um that she used to she'd come into class and she would just go on Tik Tok and that's what she would do all class long is just watch Tik Tok in her desk um you know and like no you should be learning not doing more Tik Tok in school so it's just insane that we let kids take the greatest distraction devices ever invented into the classroom with them I would argue that they are learning but what they're learning are these rapidly reinforced dopamine Loops that lead to diminished amounts of dopamine not just in short periods of time but very quickly and that inhibit other forms of learning yeah that's right and the ability to pay attention right to to a teacher which is not as stimulating as what you're seeing on Tik Tok there's tons of learning it's but it's learning of all the wrong things that's right that's right so that's the third Norm is uh no uh is phonefree schools you have to lock up the phone in the morning either a lock in a phone lock or Yonder pouch um if the policy is you keep in your pocket that's not a policy that's just a recipe for constant conflict with the kids because they can't help it they have to text if anyone's texting they have to be texting and the fourth Norm is the hardest the fourth Norm is uh far more Independence free playay and responsibility in the real world because what we need to do is not just roll back the phone based childhood and make them just sit and do nothing we have to do is restore a really fun adventurous childhood like you know what you were saying you know you go out on your bicycle you're hanging out with your friends friends sometimes something happens and boy you have memories I mean exciting things happen scary things happen you have memories and you know I worry about like what you know what boys today you know I have a group of Buddy my group of friends that I you know we we still talk about things that happened you know things that amazing things that happened when we were in college or after college and I wonder what boys young boys today are going to say you know you remember fortnite game 27363 where you were trapped in that Elevator Shaft and I had to shoot you out no I don't remember that one you know like uh the the virtual Adventures are just not going to cut it our kids need Adventure they need Independence and Adventure uh where they work out the conflicts themselves so if we do those four things I think we can restore childhood in the real world no smartphone before high school no social media till 16 phone- free schools more Independence free play and responsibility in the real world those four things and these are things that we can all do if we work together if we do them at the same time if you're the only family that's keeping your kid off a Smartphone till high school and off of social media till 16 you're imposing a cost on your child and she may be lonely and she'll say Mom I'm left out now she might still thank you as we saw last night some one of the women said her daughter thanked her for keeping her off but at the time it was painful for her and so my hope is by spreading these Norms no parent will ever be in that position again where their kid is the only one in the class who doesn't have a smartphone at age 10 to have this"}

And we also explored a little bit of how it can be bad for relationship if it exceeds the generative drive. What about the aggressive proactiveness drive? How does that show up in romantic pairings? If one person has a high proactiveness, aka aggressive drive, and the other person does not, what does that look like? Do you see that often in your clinical practice? Paul Conti: Sure. If this makes sense, maybe we look a t that example of the person who's a two and the person who's an eight on the sex drive scale, right? You'd say, okay, the person who's a t wo, who's trying to raise that right, has a strong generative drive. What does that mean? The person thinks, you know what? I think I can do this. I can set myself about this. I see it will make my relationship better, I'm going to give it a try. That's a generative drive in action, the pleasure drive. The person may look at that and say, look, maybe this can be more fun for me, right? It hasn't been that fun for me. If I have a low pleasure drive, could I start enjoying this more? And then maybe that moves up, right? Or maybe I have a higher pleasure drive, but it's not been gratified because I haven't been able to be open and honest. Let me see if I can make that better. Then what's active, what the person is d oing, is then going to be the aggressive or assertive, proactive to that drive and going to the potential in that drive and mining some of what's in it. Like, yeah, how am I going to do that? I'm going to bring myself to bear, a nd that's not an easy thing. It's not like that person then all of a sudden decides to be more sexual. There has to be a lot of communication between the two people, a lot of discussion of what setting might be best for that, what helps the person feel understood or feel more comfortable. There's a lot then, to do there. And the person may even need to g o back to the pillars because the p erson may feel like, whoa, I don't think I can do that. And then it is... that's not good. I want to do that. What is it that I can't do? There's a realization there. And then maybe the person who's an eight because they're so well connected gets it. Okay. You can't do that. Let me support you in whatever way while you're figuring that out. Because they're both generative, they want to figure that out. Andrew Huberman: Sorry to interrupt. When you say, go back to the pillars, you mean go back to exploring the structure of themselves and their function of themselves-- Paul Conti: Yes. Andrew Huberman: --so that they can, for instance, get some insight into what sorts of defense mechanisms might be in place-- Paul Conti: Right. Andrew Huberman: --what they're paying attention to or their behaviors, like maybe even health related behaviors that could be impacting their sex drive, but maybe even things that reside at a deeper level. The unconscious mind, talking to somebody till they make a connection around shame or some story that they've integrated into their thinking at a subconscious level. Paul Conti: Right. Just an example that I see a l ot is avoidance, where, again, not always, but let's say the person who's the two on the sex drive scale who f inds like, I can't do it, r ight, wow, I just can't bring myself to do it. And then they go back and they explore. This happens a lot where there's avoidance. And then we get curious about the avoidance because the person's like, there's something that just, I don't want to do that. So there's avoidance. We identify avoidance. We also identify that it's not healthy, b ecause the person does actually want to do that because it's good for the relationship and it could be good for them, too, a nd then maybe we start looking at u nconscious mind, right, or conscious mind. And maybe we don't find it, because it's easy. Now, if I said, oh, there was a major trauma that the person hasn't processed. Sometimes it's that, but a lot of times it's not that. Maybe that person just never learned to feel comfortable with sexuality. Or maybe the way that they experience o r are attracted to sexuality was disparaged or denigrated. Or they had some bad feeling about it because the society and the culture told them that. Or maybe they had a couple of bad experiences where they were treated in a certain way. And then it's like, okay, that person comes by that honestly, there's not a major trauma there. In fact, unfortunately, there's a trauma that's almost predictable from the way our society has been structured. So person can go, look at that. I'm like, right, I never learned how t o do this or how to be comfortable with this. Or you know what I learned that I'm not good at it, or I learned that no one will enjoy it with me. But that's not true. These are situations not on the side o f a loving relationship. Now t hat person is able to bring that knowledge to bear, whether it came from t he unconscious mind or the conscious mind. And then that's how you work to start shifting things. Like, that was then, this is now. It is not then. when, say, the person, say in high s chool, had a sexuality that others didn't a pprove of and made them feel bad, well, guess what? It's not then. And that's unfortunate. It's wrong. It's unjust. We're going to honor and validate all that that is. But we're also going to look at that. That was then, this is now. And you get to behave differently now. You're an adult now, and adults get to choose their relationships, and you chose a good relationship. So this is the kind of thing that can get that person to the p oint where they can go back up through now. What happens at the end of it? The geyser is stronger. There's more agency, there's more of a sense of gratitude. Why? Because the person can attach themselves more to, I'm so lucky to have this person, as opposed to, damn it, I wish that person didn't have a higher sex drive, right? And they feel better about themselves instead o f, what's wrong with me that I d on't have a higher sex drive? Or I said they wish the other person had a lower sex drive or wish they had a higher sex drive that's not grateful. Like I'm grateful I am who I a m and that I have any sex drive at all. And I'm grateful for this other person. Now, through that, that change, they can go back and better access the assertion, t he proactive drive, the aggressive drive, whatever w e want to call it, because they've taken away, they've gone and worked through the barrier to it. Then they're able to be a little m ore out of their comfort zone, and the other person meets them there, right? And they start having this healthy thing b etween them where the us that is them, the love between them, gets better, right? And then where do they find themselves? That's how they get to the five, which is not a compromise between eight a nd two that satisfies neither. It is a compromise between eight and t wo that is way better for both and for the relationship. Andrew Huberman: I'm curious about common pairings that you observe in"}
{"question": "Did your parents' unconventional approach to your musical education, such as not requiring you to practice scales and etudes, ultimately contribute to your passion for the violin?", "doc_id": "X8Hw8zeCDTA_6", "video_id": "X8Hw8zeCDTA", "video_title": "Dr. Maya Shankar: How to Shape Your Identity & Goals", "video_header": "Playing Violin, Childhood", "segment_idx": "6", "time_start": "29:29", "time_end": "34:47", "context": "I'd like to talk more about the violin, not just because I failed miserably at the violin, but actually, I figured out pretty early on I wasn't going to be a musician. I still have absolutely no ability to read music. I can memorize lyrics very easily, and I love music, and I love classical music as well as other forms of music, but zero musical talent. You, on the other hand, got quite good at violin. It was interesting for me to learn that the violin was a bit of a rebellious choice for you, given your family history. And you and I do both share this fairly unusual fact that both of our fathers are theoretical physicists. So did you feel pressured to be a scientist or something else? And being a musician, was that initially looked at as a route to poverty or a bad choice, or were your parents a bit more cautious, like, oh, okay, that's great, but maybe make that a supplement to your other studies and pursuits. Maya Shankar: Yeah. So I'm the youngest of four kids, and kind of stereotypically, my three older siblings were total math wizzes, they were, you know, taking the SAT when they were very young because they were so talented. But I think one antagonist to some of those cultural forces is that my mom, when she had grown up in India, had felt very stifled by her environment. Like, as a young woman who was very capable and very smart, I mean, she majored in physics. She was mostly kept to the spaces of domestic chores, occasional singing lessons. But mostly her job was like, do your homework and then help with cooking. Right, and cleaning and whatnot. And so when she moved to this country with my dad in the 1970s, she was actually very excited. She was 21 years old, by the way. So, long story short, she had met my dad 20 days prior to their getting married. So it was an arranged meeting. And my dad is doing his postdoc at Harvard in physics at the Society of Fellows. And my mom just joins him after a winter break in the dorm. And everyone's like, hey, man, how was your break? And there's like, I went snowboarding and I went, whatever, to Tahoe. And my dad's like, I got married. And so this new couple arrives, and my mom was so lonely in this country. I mean, this was before you could text your parents overseas or use a WhatsApp group. So she could only handwrite letters to her family back home. And her goal was, you know what? I'm going to create a little army around me in the form of children. So she had four kids, and she was absolutely intent on exposing us to as many extracurricular activities as she could. So I have two older brothers and I have an older sister, especially her girls. She said, you can do whatever you want. I'm going to give you lay the land when you're young, but when you find something that you're passionate about, I really want to give you the opportunity to explore it. So I think I really benefited from the fact that she had been denied that kind of exposure and the ability to pursue her dreams, artistic or otherwise. And so she was really hell bent on making sure that we kids were able to. My older three siblings played musical instruments, so, like clarinet, trumpet, flute. I think they were surprised by my affinity for it because when I was six, my mom brought down my grandmother's violin from the attic. So my grandmother had played Indian classical music. So that's where you're sitting cross legged on the floor and your violins facing the ground. It's a very different style of music. But as, like, a parting gift, my grandmother had given it to my mom and said, hey, bring this with you to the US. So she opened the instrument that day, and I just instantly fell in love with it. And I asked very quickly for a quarter-size violin of my own. And while my parents had to nudge me to do all sorts of things, they really never had to push me to practice, which felt extraordinary at the time. Like, okay, clearly the violin is something that Maya has intrinsic motivation for, because how is it that we're not asking her to have to practice all the time? Similar to you, Andrew, I never to this day, I have a really hard time reading music. I never, I was a terrible sight reader. I couldn't, if you put a piece of music in front of me, I would not be able to tell you probably what it would sound like. Today, I learn entirely by ear. So I started with the Suzuki method, which, as you know, is entirely by ear. And then I had an extremely kind, awesome, but very inexperienced teacher. I was his first student. My mom went backstage at a symphony concert in New Haven, which is where I grew up, and just asked the concertmaster, like, hey, will you teach my daughter? And he's like, sure. Never taught anyone before, but I'll give this a go. And so we just made things up along the way. I mean, he would play stuff and I would mimic it, and I would let my emotions and whatever innate musicality guide me. And eventually, I think what that did actually is really interesting, from a skill building perspective my technique absolutely suffered in the long term from not having a more structured approach, but I was able to fall in love with this endeavor much more quickly than other kids who had drill sergeants that were forcing them to practice their scales every day and practice etudes. I mean, that stuff is so boring, right? And when you're a little kid, you just want to bang your head against the wall when you're put up against that, when there's so many barriers to actually enjoying the fun parts, which are actually playing the pieces. So the one kind of fun aside about my musical journey is I got to jump straight to the fun stuff, and I think that helped me cultivate a much more natural love of the instrument."}

stamina because it is probably 1: am Israel time now um and you just arrived later I think um but you're doing terrifically well so I I um if you'll indulge us just a touch further there are two topics that um I want to touch on and if you want to cover these in shorter Thrift that's fine although don't feel any obligation to um the first one is I think most people are familiar with the scent of food or Foods as a signal of the nutrient contents of those Foods um you know an orange that smells great or the smell of something baking you know it it it suggests something about the the contents and quality of that food after all you and I both separately lived in the same apartment in Berkeley above the cheeseboard which the smell of cheese wafting up through the cheeseboard is something I will never forget and the breads never forget it um amazing uh red I mean I don't know if you've conveyed that clearly enough to listeners or Watchers the prob really just discovered that we lived in the same we've never met I mean like this before Y and we lived in the same AP are we click friends I had in a lingering way I guess absolutely through the through the the through the uh floorboards it had a great floor that place it had a great wooden floor it was an amazing place I lived there with my girlfriend a year and a half and then uh it was an amazing place um we won't give it out the address for out of respect for the people that live there now um but do check out the cheeseboard if you're ever in Berkeley their hours are weird but so you have to look online but that they're it's a unique place with with grap bread and cheese and um some good flavors of pizza um in any case um I'm wondering whether or not smell can signal things about the nutrient contents of foods in a way that's divorced from the smell that we are perceiving so for instance I could imagine based on what you've told us about smell today that um you know I I don't know I I I I smell a a a piece of meat cooking and it smells great to me and I think of it as oh that's so Savory and my mouth is watering and I love the smell of this and I'm thinking okay this is protein and fat and I love the taste of steak and a little bit of char but that Nature has co-opted that to get ensure or I should say increase the likelihood that I will ingest some other thing that's in stake for that has no odor but whose nutrient content is very important to me for instance amino acids right right I mean amino acids are essential to life and yet um we don't go around sniffing for amino acids we go around sniffing for savoriness Umami type uh uh tastes and and things of that sort so um I could imagine a million different examples of this in the same way I could imagine that the scent of somebody that we fall in love with or become romantically attached to or you know sexually attracted to is signaling all sorts of things about sure the potential for offspring of a particular immune status that's a longterm game but also um something about um uh pleasure and safety of a potential interaction so what I'm asking here is about that whether or not there are subconscious signals that the um olfactory system has uh learned to seek but learned to seek through um more overt signals sort of the tip of the iceberg phenomenon so you know I don't have a good answer for you although I think it's a really good question um or or or a good idea in fact so so whether whether the there's you know order cues on nutrient value is a really good idea more moreover it's probably good to the extent that somebody probably did it and I should know and don't um we haven't done anything on that line so I don't know I don't know if if the nutrient value of food is systematically encoded in odor um if that's not been done and I will check after our uh uh uh meeting today than it should be um it's a really good idea I mean one of the reasons I asked this is because um you know the Obesity crisis in the US is a huge issue and elsewhere and highly processed foods um you know have a lot of things that are problematic but one of the things that they don't have uh often is a direct relationship between the scent The Taste and the nut and the nutrient content and I don't mean macronutrient sugar fat excuse me uh carbohydrates fats and proteins but the the vitamins and micronutrients things that support the microbiome whereas foods that are not processed for instance meat or a piece of fruit um contain many micronutrients that are vital to aspects of our biology but we don't go around sniffing for probiotics I'll tell you one sort of factoid that may support your hypothesis here and that is that there appears to be potential all Factory perceptual similarity in metabolic products so something that's metabolized ized from something else has perceptual similarity across those those two things so so so metabolic Cascades play into the coding of all Factory space and and that is consistent with the direction you're you're you're implying but again I don't I don't know of a direct test of of uh of nutritional value in smell and and again the fact that I don't know doesn't mean of course that it doesn't exist and in this case I would suspect that it should exist um in scientific press and and if not there then with the companies that have vested interest in this which are many um share just just an an an amusing anecdote to share with you is that we've received two independent um um PE you know companies who have turned to our lab recently uh asking for help uh to to bring odor to engineered meat right that's a growing thing and all these you know meats that are not you had to bring it up this this audience is going to be very polarized along the along the lines of engineered meat um yeah you're not you're not pro you're not promoting oh no no no no I I'm agnostic but but uh but we've had two companies turn to us and say look you know we have this great product but it just doesn't smell like meat so help us make it smell like meat interesting uh the reason it's so polarizing is that anything related to nutrition on social media is a total barbed wire topic we've had experts on nutrition come on here we'll have more but I know nothing wor you're you're safe no don't worry no is not is not promoting uh he hasn't even said whether or not he's going to help them out no um we we're not actually not not because yeah it just never it didn't happen yeah no that the the whether or not those um engineered Meats are uh yum yuck or me is is a personal issue to people in terms of taste whether or not they are better for neutral or worse for you and the planet than given the ingredients that are required that's a whole world will avoid now I I will

I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, I have the pleasure of introducing Dr. Matthew Johnson. Dr. Johnson is a professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, where he also directs the Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research. As many of you know, there's extreme excitement about the use of psychedelics for the treatment of various disorders of the mind. Dr. Johnson's laboratory is among the premier laboratories in the world understanding how these compounds work, how things like Psilocybin, and LSD, and related compounds allow neural circuitry in the brain to be shaped and changed, such that people can combat diseases, like depression, or trauma, or other disorders of the mind that cause tremendous suffering. Dr. Johnson is also an expert in understanding how different types of drugs impact different types of human behaviors, such as sexual behavior, risk taking, and crime. Dr. Johnson and his work have also been featured prominently in the popular press, such as articles in \"The New York Times\" and Michael Pollan's book, \"How to Change Your Mind,\" and in a feature in \"60 Minutes\" about psychedelics and the new emerging science of psychedelic therapies for treating mental disorders. During the course of today's conversation, Dr. Johnson and I talk about psychedelics at the level of what's called micro dosing, whether or not it is useful for the treatment of any mental disorders. We also talk about more typical macrodosing, what those macrodoses entail, and he walks us through what an experiment of a patient taking psychedelics for the treatment of depression looks like in his laboratory from start to finish. The conversation was an absolutely fascinating one for me to partake in. I learned so much about the past, present, and future of psychedelic treatments and compounds. And indeed, I hope to have Dr. Johnson on this podcast again in the not too distant future, so that we can talk about other compounds that powerfully impact the mind and human behavior, and perhaps, can also be used to treat various diseases."}
{"question": "How can I position my laptop or tablet to maximize my focus and alertness while working?", "doc_id": "Ze2pc6NwsHQ_7", "video_id": "Ze2pc6NwsHQ", "video_title": "Optimizing Workspace for Productivity, Focus, & Creativity", "video_header": "Arranging Your Environment", "segment_idx": "7", "time_start": "28:06", "time_end": "31:17", "context": "which is to look down at their laptop, tablet, or phone, if you want to be alert and you want to maintain the maximum amount of focus for whatever it is that you're reading or doing, you want that screen or whatever it is that you're looking at to at least be at eye level and ideally slightly above it. Now, I haven't seen many workspaces that take advantage of this very hardwired neuro-biological fact. So what should you do with this information? Well, if you're somebody who sits down to do work and starts to feel sleepy, or simply unfocused, unable to attend to whatever it is that you're doing, I highly recommend that you take your laptop or tablet. I do hope that most people aren't doing serious work on their phones because it's such a small visual window, and we can talk about why that's an issue later. And the idea would be to place that screen of your tablet or your laptop or other computer, and try and get it elevated at least to nose level, your nose level, or even higher. Now I realize that can be complicated to do, I've long, just used a stack of books, or I'll sometimes take a box and turn upside down and set it there. I do use a mixed standing-seated desk, I'll talk about that in a few minutes. There are a number of different ways that you could do this, you could wall mount a monitor. I think many people are working with laptops, it's a little bit harder to do that with a laptop, some people though will configure a second screen. You have to decide what's right for you in your budget. But again, in addition to having a brightly lit room, to be able to focus and attend to whatever it is you're working on, you want to have that screen positioned high in your visual environment. Now you wouldn't want it on the ceiling necessarily, I know that would be pretty cool, but you do want it above you. Now, there are a couple solutions to this that don't involve a wall mount or stacking books or boxes. For instance, you could be one of those people that likes to lie in bed or on the sofa and get your screen up above you by putting pillows on your knees. I used to actually do a lot of my writing and work in the middle of the night, I don't do this anymore and I don't recommend it, but I used to do a lot of work from bed. Now I no longer bring electronics for work into the bedroom. I just really try and keep the bedroom for sleeping or whatever else. But in terms of lying down on the couch, it is somewhat easier to get that screen up above you, you can kind of slide underneath that screen and get typing, but there's a problem with that. And we'll talk about this a little bit more in a moment, but it turns out that your posture, literally the position of your body relative to gravity, also has important implications for how alert you are. So ideally you would be standing or seated. I would say the ideal would be standing, second best will be seated and your screen will be either directly in front of you or slightly above you. Or if you wanted to get really fancy, you could create a situation where it was above you and slightly tilted toward you so that you actually had to maintain kind of proper neck posture. This accomplishes a number of things. In addition to making you more alert, you also get away from the so-called text neck. You know, people are starting to look more like C's nowadays, the shape of the letter C because we're constantly looking down. I do every once in a while, see somebody who's texting in public with it at eye level, it always looks a little odd that they're doing that, but I always admire their posture at the same time, so we shouldn't give them a hard time. So this is another feature that you can arrange into your physical workspace. Again, whether or not you're seated or you're standing throughout the day, try and get that screen elevated."}

{"question": "What are some key factors that influence the dopamine system, and how does context impact the brain's response to rewards and aversive stimuli?", "doc_id": "RI112zW8GDw_4", "video_id": "RI112zW8GDw", "video_title": "Dr. Robert Malenka: How Your Brain’s Reward Circuits Drive Your Choices", "video_header": "Context, Cues & Dopamine Modification", "segment_idx": "4", "time_start": "17:38", "time_end": "25:34", "context": "the system, but in sort of real world terms, how should I think about this? Even in my training as a neuroscientist, I know neurons can be a little active, a lot active, everything in between. They can be active over long periods of time or short periods of time. But let's use the example of the donut. I like a glazed old fashioned donut. I actually don't have a craving for sweet thIngs, but donuts is an exception. I like the glazed old fashioned donut, but if I were to see just a little piece of a glazed old fashioned donut versus a full glazed old fashioned donut, could I expect that more dopamine is released to the anticipation of the complete donut? And then the other question is, how does context influence the dopamine system? For instance, if I'm very full, a glazed old fashioned donut might be aversive to me. Whereas if I'm just a little bit hungry, or if I'm actually more on a schedule of rewarding myself for abstaining from sweet, fatty foods, then abstaining from the food might be its own form of reward. Robert Malenka: Yeah. Andrew Huberman: And so, to me, the dopamine system seems incredibly simple and yet incredibly prone to immediate context and the kinds of nuance that we're constantly juggling. I'll interrupt myself to say that we're constantly juggling a bunch of different reward contingencies. We want to have good health metrics and maybe have a certain aesthetic qualities to our body, but we also want the doughnut. And so how does a system as simple as one neuromodulator system and the VTA to nucleus accumbens, and with some connections to the memory area, how does it balance all of that information in real time? To me, that's just, like, staggeringly complex, but also incredibly interesting. Robert Malenka: I think you,,, beautifully put, very eloquent description. You just said it. It's staggeringly simple, simultaneously staggeringly complex. And you asked several different questions. So context makes an enormous importance. And that's one of the reasons I became interested in the dopamine reward circuitry is, as you know, as a colleague in the academic neuroscience world, but your listeners probably don't, I started out my career studying very basic mechanisms of plasticity. How does the brain modify itself? And what makes the brain different than the computer hardware is the physical connections in the brain are constantly changing the strength of the communication. Similarly for the dopamine reward circuitry, it's highly plastic and it's highly contextually dependent. And so you gave the example of donuts and feeding, and I'll answer your question about the cues. Yes, I used to give the example of Thanksgiving, so let me give that example. In the morning of Thanksgiving, all, for most of us in the United States, the morning of Thanksgiving, if you're at home visiting your parents, the smells of the apple pie, the smells of the turkey cooking are highly repetitive, highly reinforcing. You're anticipating that fun event. You're anticipating Uncle Joe coming to visit you for Thanksgiving. And that's all because these cues, the smells, the anticipation of Uncle Joe, your previous experiences, are part of your memory system, sort of talking to, in a simple way, your reward circuitry. So you're building up this anticipation, one could almost say this craving, which maybe we'll talk about in the context of addiction. And then, make a long story short, think about that evening at the end of Thanksgiving. Those exact same cues, the exact same smell of the apple pie, turkey, and Uncle Joe himself. At the very least, they're no longer repetitive, meaning they might actually be aversive. The last thing you want is a piece of apple pie. You can't wait for Uncle Joe to leave your Thanksgiving dinner. And I always argue that does not happen magically. That happens because your brain has been modified by the context in which it sits. And this very important modulatory system, this reward circuitry, is responding to the exact same stimuli with a very different response. So I'm just telling you, I'm repeating what you said, the phenomenology. And again, my other favorite example is any of us who have been in an intimate relationship knows that the love of your life can turn to the bane of your existence in 20 seconds. And again, that doesn't happen magically. This person who you crave, who you love, does something, and two minutes later, your brain is saying, oh, my God, I may have to break up with this person, or, this is an incredibly painful emotional experience, and what fascinates me about the brain is, how does the brain mediate that rapid change? So now back to, so, yes, context is everything about how this powerful neuromodule choice system that uses dopamine works, and the truth is, we don't know. It's because the inputs onto these dopamine neurons, the other nerve cells that are driving the activity of the dopamine neurons, and I've actually studied this in my lab at Stanford University with a colleague you know well, Lee Chun Luo, who's a world class neuroscientist. We've studied the complexity of the neuroanatomy of the dopamine system, and these dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area, the source of the reward circuitry, dopamine, are receiving inputs from all over the brain. They're receiving indirectly or directly inputs from visual areas, from somatosensory areas. And I'm not giving you a really good answer because that's one of the goals of my research, to try to understand how context, how the history that you've had with these cues, which we're going to get back to of the donut or of a drug, how has that modified how this neuromodulatory system responds? Similarly, the nucleus accumbens, the target of this powerful modulator, dopamine, is receiving communications, what we call inputs from all sorts of brain regions that you know about. Andrew, your audience may not. It receives inputs from an area called the hippocampus, which you may have covered in previous podcasts, which is very powerfully, very important for memories, both establishing new memories and, again, remember, that makes sense. You want this system, this dopamine reward circuitry, to be very connected to memory systems. So the activity in the nucleus accumbens is modulated by dopamine while it is receiving information from the hippocampus, which helps encode new memories, while it's receiving information from a brain area called the amygdala, which is a part of the brain involved in our emotional experiences. The accumbens also receives inputs from the prefrontal cortex, which is this brain area.

In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better meet your immediate and long-term health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. And nowadays with the advent of modern DNA test, you can also get insight into, for example, what your biological age is and compare that to your chronological age. The problem with a lot of DNA tests and blood tests, however, is you get information back about metabolic factors, lipids, and hormones, and so forth, but you don't know what to do with or about that information. InsideTracker solves that problem with a simple platform that allows you to click on any specific factor, learn more about it and what it does in your brain and body, and also the various nutritional supplementation and other types of interventions you can take to bring the levels of that factor into the ranges that are optimal for you and your health.

Today's episode is also brought to us by ROKA. ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are of the absolute highest quality. They also have some really unique features that make them especially attractive from the standpoint of aesthetics and performance. The company was founded by two all-American swimmers from Stanford and everything about their eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed with performance in mind. Initially, the eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed for sport, that is for running and for cycling, et cetera. And indeed, still their eyeglasses and sunglasses are very lightweight and they won't slip off your face if you get sweaty, but they also have a terrific aesthetic. You can wear them to work. You can wear them out to eat. I wear readers at night when I work, or if I drive and I wear sunglasses sometimes during the middle of the day, if it's too bright and I need sunglasses in order to see. If you'd like to try ROKA eyeglasses, or sunglasses, you can go to ROKA, that's ROKA.com and enter the code huberman to save 20% off your first order. Again, that's ROKA.com and enter the code huberman at checkout. Today's episode is also brought to us by LMNT. LMNT is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't, meaning no sugar, but plenty of the correct ratios of sodium, magnesium and potassium, and those three electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium are critical for your neuron, your nerve cell function, and for the function of all the cells in your brain and body. I've mentioned this before on the podcast, but I'm a fan of salt, not taking too much salt, but certainly not getting too little salt. LMNT has 1000 milligrams, that is one gram of salt, which might sound like a lot of salt. But for many people, especially people who are following low carbohydrate diets, or who are exercising or sweating a lot, or both, that level of salt can actually help you in many circumstances. Getting the appropriate level of salt, and certainly the appropriate levels of electrolytes will improve your cognitive function and will improve your physical performance. If you'd like to try LMNT you can go to drinklmnt, that's lmnt.com/huberman, and you'll get a free sample pack with your order. That's drinklmnt.com/huberman.

{"question": "How does hypnosis work to engage neuroplasticity and accelerate learning by combining an alert, focused state with a deep, restful state?", "doc_id": "nwSkFq4tyC0_16", "video_id": "nwSkFq4tyC0", "video_title": "Using Science to Optimize Sleep, Learning & Metabolism", "video_header": "Nap/Focus Ratios For Accelerated Learning", "segment_idx": "16", "time_start": "49:42", "time_end": "52:43", "context": "is not the neuroplasticity that you're amplifying by listening to tones or smelling odors in sleep, but the neuroplasticity that you can access with non sleep deep rest. So NSDR, non sleep deep rest as well as short 20 minute naps, which are very close to non sleep deep rest because people rarely drop into deep States of sleep during short naps, unless they're very sleep deprived. NSDR has been shown to increase rates of learning when done for 20 minute bouts for a proxy- to match an approximately 90 minute about of learning. So what am I talking about? 90 minute cycles are these ultradian cycles that I've talked about previously. And we tend to learn very well by taking a 90 minute cycle transitioning into some focus mode early in the cycle, and it's hard to focus and then deep focus and learning feels almost like agitation and strain and then by the end of that 90 minute cycle, it becomes very hard to maintain focus and learn more information. There's a study published in Cell Reports last year. Great journal, excellent paper showing that 20 minute naps or light sleep of a sort of non sleep deep rest taken immediately after or close to it, doesn't have to be immediately after you finished the last sentence of learning or whatever it is, or bar of music. But you know, a couple of minutes after transitioning to a period of non sleep deep rest, where you're turning off the analysis of duration path and outcome has been shown to accelerate learning to a significant degree. Both the amount of information and the retention of that information. So that's pretty cool, because this is a cost-free, drug-free way of accelerating learning without having to get more sleep. But simply by introducing these 20 minute bouts. I would encourage people if they want to try this to consider the 20 minutes per every 90 minutes of ultradian learning cycle, there you're incorporating a number of different neuroscience backed tools 90 minute cycles for focused learning. It could be motor, it could be cognitive, it could be musical, whatever, and then transitioned to a 20 minute non sleep deep rest protocol. I just want to cue you the fact that in last` episode in the caption on YouTube, we provided links to two different yoga nidra, non sleep deep rest protocols as well as hypnosis protocols that are clinically backed from my colleague David Spiegel at Stanford Psychiatry Department. All those resources are free. There are also a lot of other hypnosis scripts out there. I like the ones from Michael Sealey S-E-A-L, I think it's E-Y, maybe it's just L-Y, you can find them easily on YouTube, clinical hypnosis scripts meaning not stage hypnosis. They're not designed to get you to do anything. In fact they're just designed to help rewire your brain circuitry. Now, how does hypnosis work that way? This has a lot to do with sleep because it engages neuro-plasticity by bringing together two things that normally are separate from one another, one is the alert focused wakeful state"}
{"question": "What is the recommended percentage of resistance training sets that should be performed at or near muscular failure versus those that should be done without failure?", "doc_id": "XLr2RKoD-oY_18", "video_id": "XLr2RKoD-oY", "video_title": "Science of Muscle Growth, Increasing Strength & Muscular Recovery", "video_header": "10% Of Resistance Training Should Be To “Failure”, the Rest Should End “Near” Failure", "segment_idx": "18", "time_start": "56:45", "time_end": "58:18", "context": "This is where it gets a little bit controversial but I think nowadays most people agree and Dr. Galpin confirmed that 10% not to be confused with the 10% we discussed earlier, but 10% of the sets of a given workout or 10% of workouts overall should be of the high-intensity sort where one is actually working to muscular failure. Now I say not true muscular failure because in theory you have a concentric movement which is the kind of lifting of the weight, and then you have the ecentric portion of muscle contraction, which is the lowering. And ecentric movements because of the way that muscle fibers lengthen and that sliding act myosin that we talked about before, you're always stronger in lowering something than you are in lifting it. But the point being that most of your training most of your sets should be not to failure. And the reason for that is it allows you to do more volume of work without fatiguing the nervous system and depleting the nerve to muscle connection in ways that are detrimental. So we can make this simple. Perform anywhere from 5 to 15 sets of resistance exercise per week, and that's per muscle, and that's in this 30% to 80% of what your one-repetition maximum. That seems to be the most scientifically supported way of offsetting any decline in muscle strength if you're working in the kind of five set range and in increasing muscle strength when you start to get up into the 10 and 15 set range. Now, the caveat to that is everyone varies"}

probably like what you know well clearly never parented ah well no actually um it's an interesting idea perhaps not correct or incorrect but maybe Dynamic across time where the real question is if kids know that they are running the family in terms of what they do or their inability to not be attended to Etc um is driving the whole relationship that the parents are in yeah versus you know recognizing and here I'm I'm matching two parent home but we could talk about divorced or people with significant others or single parent homes um been in all of those um you got of Wonder like are kids really paying attention to how much they are being prioritized to the point where if they observe their parents tending to their own needs that they feel deprivation or is it make them feel safer like hey Mom Andor dad are taking care of themselves and can show up better yes I think that is critically important and it kind of goes again to boundaries like of a parent like my relationship with my kid is so important and I'm not going to let that take over me like that is not all of me I am not only a caregiver to my to my kid like I would stand by that all day long like is that an important part of me and it's still a part of me and I think this is really important to own as a parent because again we tend to get a like we get apologist for it or we look for our kids permission we'll say look I need to go out with Dad without you okay like we have a relationship too like and we again there's that job confusion and my kid feels that and again it's that kind of giving them too much power I've said this to my kids a lot so say why do you go out with Dad without me I say it's a great question you know first of all dad and I were married before we had kids our relationship is really important to us and we love being with you and being with you is different than just being the two of us and that really really matters to us and so you don't have to be happy about it you can you and let's say I have a babysitter I know safe with you can cry when I leave and the babysitter will hold you and we're going to go out to dinner and we're going to come back and you know we'll see you in the morning yeah I think that is so important I actually think this is another topic like this topic of like rage and Parenthood is like a big topic like the way why like why do I get to these moments of Rage so often that my screaming it's not just screaming at my kids it's really rageful and I think the parents often who are the most vulnerable to that are the ones where where they're not make they're not meeting like any of their non-caregiving needs which makes sense that a part of them is like screaming out like what about me I used to go to dance class I used to see friends I used to go out with my partner and talk about things other than you know our kids and so again if I think a kids need a sturdy leader right more than anything else and sturdiness is not allowing yourself to be taken over by any one thing including your relationship with your kid is it truly better for their to be two sturdy leaders and one sturdy leader I realize this is a controversial question yeah I mean I know and I know there's research to back this up that like having one kind of sturdy leader in your life is massively protective I really believe that and so when parents say my partner isn't I'm like we we have research this is true is two better than one I don't know the research like probably I don't know you know but what I think is important in there too is what's not great for kids is having like all the caregivers be some like perfectly attuned caregiver right like that actually does not set up your kid for life at all right because I don't know anyone who thinks the partner I'm going to be with one day is going to be perfectly attuned to all my needs let me go find that person so you know you have one sturdy leader you have two but like being sturdy part of that is you're going to you're going to rupture you're going to rupture you're going to messed up you're going to hopefully repair you know after um but sturdiness I just want to make clear is so not the same as like Perfection Perfection is creepy it's not a thing no one needs that I love that um it's so first time I've laughed out loud on this podcast about a statement like that um yeah the notion of perfection is is kind of creepy um but sturdiness is anything but creepy that's there's it's just such a beautiful word for all the right reasons um what about behavioral examples in parents so for instance if children observe parents um being affectionate to one another in appropriate ways right you know um you know attending to one another in in boundar but empathically attuned ways um do you think that projects forward into their notion of of what adult relationships are like and should be like conversely if parents are yelling at one another um do you think that projects forward into it's okay to yell in adult relationships yeah I mean I yeah I think kids are they're expert noticers they notice everything right as part of how they've learned to survive as such helpless you know humans so they definitely notice they definitely act like sponges um so yes if you're you know kind of privileged enough in that way to grow up in a home or you have parents who in general are fairly affectionate they take responsibility for their stuff they communicate in a healthy way I think that is like a true privilege you go into adulthood with yes the Other Extreme right you grow up with parents who you know they yell or they can even yell in scary voices again what I think is really important is the witnessing of that isn't going to be as impactful to a kid as the witnessing of it and nobody naming it and talking to them about it so this is why so often like kids will be in difficult stages intense Tantrums major issues at school and someone's like what do I do like what do I do with this well like I give you all the strategies in the world but if that is just your kids way of kind of manifesting all of their struggles with this like huge marital conflict that's happening it's not going to work so it's all part of the same system and so saying to your kid after you fight with your partner hey I think you heard Daddy and I screaming and I'm sure that felt scary because it does feel scary because they know you're their base so if their base is of a house is like you know Feels Like An Earthquake it feels scary like and you know another line I like it's like you were right to notice that we were using loud voices again I think that's massively confidence you know building um maybe what was that like for you or if you have a little kid just that's enough you know and they might look at you and say like can I have my snack now but it's still really sunk in so if there is a lot of conflict again I think it's really important we we talk about that with our kids don't leave them alone what about teens that are really Wayward um and this could be"}
{"question": "What are the recommended ways to protect one's eyes from UV light, especially for people who don't wear corrective lenses, and are there any specific benefits to wearing UV-blocking sunglasses versus a wide-brimmed hat?", "doc_id": "_ltcLEM-5HU_17", "video_id": "_ltcLEM-5HU", "video_title": "Dr. Jeffrey Goldberg: How to Improve Your Eye Health & Offset Vision Loss",

questions about blue light I am not somebody who believes that all blue light is terrible I think it's important to avoid Bright Lights of any wavelength late at night if you want your melatonin produ to be normal and you want to sleep well doesn't matter if you're wearing blue blockers or not if you're just under blasting Bright Lights it's going to suppress your melatonin and yet some people enjoy blue blockers for that reason nowadays A lot of people wear blue blocker glasses or blue blocking lenses or conts throughout the entire day thinking that blue light is bad for our eyes during the day I happen to subscribe to the idea that we want as much bright light as we safely can tolerate during the day ideally from sunlight in order to set our circadian rhythm and yet a lot of eyeglasses and a lot of contact lenses out there have UV a Andor UVB blocking features to them so what are your thoughts on this and I'm perfectly happy to be wrong and revise my my stance on this um yeah what what what do you think about this UV AB blocking yeah it's a good it's it's a it's really important to distinguish that UV light on the light spectrum is right next to blue light red lights on the other end and of course infrared is beyond that and our eyes other animals can see these but our eyes can't see infrared that's why we call it Beyond red and we can't see ultraviolet as we call it Beyond Violet UV light is right next to Blue Light UV light is known to have a lot of adverse effects it's not really good for our skin and therefore you know we really want to avoid Sunburn and kind of UV D you know exposure and damage on our skin similarly it's not really good on our eyes and it affects both the ocular surface a little bit in terms of like kind of how dry or irritable your eyes might feel for some people and certainly over the long term UV light will accelerate the formation of cataract which is a blurring of an oxidative blurring of the lens inside the eye profound UV light can be damaging to the retina if you're getting way too much on the inside um so uh so blocking UV light I believe is just absolutely standard in every pair of eyeglasses and uh I don't know actually how much to what degree the different kinds of contact lenses also filter at least UV light now blue blockers blue blocking glasses is totally different and as I say like I think almost all glasses because the Plastics almost all glasses are not made of glass anymore they're made of plastics uh but I think almost all of them now filter the UV light which again is like probably the safe move for our eyes and periocular environment around the eye environment um so uh blue blockers you know that's been a huge fat and I'll tell you the last three years through the pandemic everybody getting on their computer hours in front of Zoom meetings where we used to walk from building to building for a meeting things like that um I you know I I remember you know like the sort of big uptic in these kinds of questions and I'm not sure that there's any that blocking blue is helpful in any way and as you say it may actually play into sort of circadian entrainment of our natural daily Rhythm so so I think blocking UV is a good idea and I think it's pretty standard um you know they make glasses by the way that actually react to UV light they're called transitions there maybe a few different brands I don't know uh but but you know these are the sunglasses that are clear except then they turn dark if you're out in the sunlight and it's not just any sunlight it's actually the UV uh wavelengths that that cause the chemical reaction in the glasses to turn from from Clear see-through to to sunglass blocked glasses and um you may notice if you if any of you out there are using these kinds of glasses uh that they don't work in the car you'll wear them in the car and they won't go to sunglasses even though it's sunny out and again that's because all standard car glass also filters UV that's why if you're riding around in the car and it's sunny out you've got your hand you know up next to the window uh wearing a t-shirt you never get a sunburn through the car window anymore because all our car glass is also filtering UV light for us so so that's a very informative answer and before we started recording you and I were discussing this practice of morning sunlight viewing which again I highly recommend over and over and you pointed out that low solar angle sunlight so sunlight Light low in the sky viewed for maybe 10 minutes a morning and again not forcing oneself to look at it and stare but blinking as needed is not going to cause extensive UV damage to the eyes it's really the when the sun is directly overhead um that we're getting a lot of UV which raises this other question which is for people that don't wear corrective lenses and therefore are not blocking UV light to the eyes um what should they do are they in trouble should they be wearing a brimmed hat brimmed Hat's a great idea that'll get rid of a lot of the direct light into the eye of course you still have reflected light off of surfaces uh and that that can include UV light of course um you know wearing sunglasses outside even if you don't have corrective lenses you know it's may may also be more comfortable to wear sunglasses outside um so so these are all fine you know at the end of the day it's probably not making a huge difference in the health of your eye whether you've spent the last 50 years wearing sunglasses really dogmatically for your out time or not um you know if you were going to develop let's just say age related cataracts inside your eyes which we'll all get cat if we all live to 120 we all get cataracts you know it's going to happen some people younger some people older maybe if you were really dogmatic about wearing your UV blocking sunglasses maybe you'd get your your cataracts at 75 years old instead of 72 years old it may not be a huge difference in that regard um so again not something to be super stressed I think it's I think it's more a question of just what are you comfortable in uh and then certainly I will say the the other advantage of a wide brim hat is it's keeping sun off of your face and these are the you know some of the especially the upturn portions of your face like the cheeks and the nose these are the some of the most common places to get some of the skin cancers that you can get over a lifetime of sunlight exposure um so you know the wide Brin haap is is it's helping you for that as well can't help but ask about Comfort at very levels of"}

this um well basically an 80s Yuppy in you know working in finance in New York and um and for anyone that scen it it's a can only be described as a violent parody of of 80s yepy culture and it's it's me dark comedy as there's going to be yeah it's as dark a comedy as it could be and and don't let your young children watch it because it's very gruesome and has like very sexual and but the the the aggressive features within the character that Bale plays um are immediately apparent in the movie like you know violent aggression sexual aggression um seeking money seeking wealth all the time a narcissism too an obsession with like everything from his skincare routine to uh his eight pack abs and like it's it's ridiculous but um but also an interesting window into some milder forms of those features that still exist in many people today right um but the Envy component starts to reveal itself a little bit later into the movie where um the scene I recall is one around where someone hands him a business card and then you hear the narrative in his own mind about how much nicer that guy's business card is then his and how he hates him so much he ends up killing the guy in very violent and sadistic fashion that's aggression over generative right right and so and the whole movie is about um this one uh aspect of culture at that time's ability to impose their will on EV everyone at their whim you know basically Bale just does whatever the hell he wants at any point goes returns videotapes in between and you know and there's so much woven into it and uh that is relevant and so much that's woven into it that's just purely for people's kind of sick entertainment um uh but that I believe it was Brett Brent East Ellis that wrote that and you know is tapping into the the aggression component pleasure component but the Envy component is really what resonates as as you come to the end of the movie is like there's no satisfying this guy he could kill or or sleep with as many people as he wants in the movie um and he can have as much wealth as he wants he can have entire buildings in fact I think he's living in an entire building at some point he takes over people's Apartments after he kills them it's it's it's wild and disgusting um but it really speaks to the extent to which Envy is woven into absolutely aggression and pleasure seeking and it's not something something that had really sunk in for me until you describe it now um because I think for most people they imagine okay when somebody has X number of millions or billions of dollars that they'll reach this place of Peace contentment and Delight right they'll have enough um and in the movie Wall Street there's that one scene where someone says you know what's your number like at what point is it enough and the guy says more that says all sorts of things about the dopaminergic system of reward systems in the brain Etc but I think it says is a lot more about Envy absolutely and just what in what a a pit of despair Envy is for everybody involved right right look Envy may not be the root of all evil but Envy plus natural disasters may be so much evil and destruction arises from envy and it may be that it's at the root of all of it and we so underappreciate that right we so underappreciate why people are destructive right which is why the roots aren't always in trauma but but a significant uh uh aspect of of where Envy arises from can often be trauma creating a sense of guilt and shame and vulnerability but but wherever a person may come by it and it's a larger discussion of envy and where it may come from is it drives destruction and if the aggressive Drive is greater than the generative drive or if the pleasure Drive is greater than the the generative drive or if both are greater than the generative drive it will drive destruction and that destruction the vast majority of times if you look deep enough you find at its roots envy that Envy may arise from guilt and shame within the person but as soon as it becomes about another right I feel guilt and shame and inadequacy inside of me but then I feel Envy of those around me it drives the vast majority of Destruction do you think that's what's happening when we see these um sadly um ever more frequent examples of um active Shooters and school shootings things of that sort yes there other there are other people who have life right and that person doesn't feel that they do so they want to go and take it away from them and that's why as long as we have human tribulation and a lot of guns this it's going to happen it's it's a it's a logical conclusion of enough people being in places of Despair and how Envy can be cultivated within us and then ultimately how it blinds people it creates such a desire for Destruction that then people will take life away from others and often people sometimes take their own life which which I think really brings to the Forefront like that that that person doesn't feel that they have a life certainly not a life worth preserving so they're then going to take the lives of others and I think we're seeing that is as Stark um a portrait of where Envy can lead I think as we can find on a one person basis we we can go we can look at Wars and their destruction on a societal basis but I think that's that's the ultimate in understanding where and we can

She actually used to be really strong when we were kids. She could move this fish tank that was in my room long before I could move it, and I was always, she's really strong. Over the years, I wouldn't call her frail by any means, but I certainly think she could benefit from some strength training. Let's say she were to start doing some leg presses or start even with air squats and maybe work up to some pushups, are the effects all local, meaning if she were to just train her legs or just do pushups, would it only be the loads applied to the limbs and muscles and tissues that were involved? - I think that's where the bulk of it is, yeah. - Okay. - Yeah. - So you need to train the whole body, essentially. - Yeah, now keep in mind, the diagnosis of osteopenia and osteoporosis is based on only three locations, the left hip, the right hip, and the lumbar spine. So, you know, that's just the convention by which we make the diagnosis. And I think part of that has to do with that's where the majority of the insults occur. Now not all of the insults, I've seen people that have, you know, because of horrible bone density, they're fracturing ankles and tibia, fibula, like they're having low tib fib fractures just walking. So clearly bone density outside of those regions does matter. But much of it is really focused on, and, by the way, you know, you fall, you break a wrist, so this is a systemic issue. But the majority of the response is a local response, 'cause it really comes down to putting a load directly on that bone, and then having that bone, in kind, respond by laying down more bone. - Before we continue with today's discussion, I'd like to just briefly acknowledge"}

Are you all covered up out in the sun? Well, that might be great for setting your circadian rhythm by way of light through the eyes 'cause that's the primary mechanism for that. But seems to me that the more of your body surface that you can safely and appropriately, please, folks, appropriately expose to the sun, the more vitamin D you're going to create.

{"question": "How long should I stay in cold water to induce a shiver and trigger brown fat thermogenesis?", "doc_id": "GqPGXG5TlZw_15", "video_id": "GqPGXG5TlZw", "video_title": "How to Lose Fat with Science-Based Tools", "video_header": "Exact Protocols: (1-5X per week); Don’t Adapt! Submerge and Exit “Sets & Reps”", "segment_idx": "15", "time_start": "52:30", "time_end": "56:12", "context": "and how much you're trying to increase your metabolism. There are studies that describe positive effects on fat loss of exposing yourself to cold, either through cold shower or through ice bath or other cold water. It doesn't have to actually have ice in it, provided it's cold enough for anytime, anywhere, excuse me, between one and five times per week. But it turns out that just one exposure per week can be valuable. The question then is how long to get into that cold environment? And how cold should that environment be? So first let's talk about how long to get into that cold environment? The answer here might be a little bit different than you might imagine. Most of you might think, oh, well if one minute is good, three minutes is better, and if three minutes is better than 10 minutes is best. But remember the goal is to get the shiver induced release of succinate, so that succinate can trigger the brown fat. It turns out that if you want to trigger the shiver, what you want to do is to get into the cold and then get out of the cold and typically not dry off, and then get back into the cold and out of the cold, that will definitely stimulate more shivering than just getting into the cold itself. So what I'm not referring to, is getting into the cold environment like an ice bath and waiting until you shiver and staying there shivering. Okay? You also don't want to get hypothermic. And I want to be clear. You want to get approval from your doctor before you do any of this. When you get into cold water, there are two factors that will dictate whether or not you shiver. Probably three, but let's just talk about the main two. One, is how cold it is. So how cold should it be? And look, if you get into water, that's very, very cold. It can actually shock your heart. It can actually give you a heart attack if it's truly, truly ice cold, and you're not adapted to that. So proceed with caution, please. I'm not a physician and I don't want to see anyone get hurt. Just cold enough to be uncomfortable is a good place to start. So for some of you that's going to be 60 degrees, for some of you that's going to be 55 degrees, for some of you it's going to be high thirties, right? Depends on how cold adapted you are, and people vary in terms of how well they tolerate the cold. So what you need to do is find a temperature that you can get into one to five, probably one to three times a week. If you really want this to accelerate fat loss. And you want to get in until you just start to shiver, and then you want to get out and not dry off, wait anywhere from one to three minutes and then get back into the cold. Now, you'll notice when you get back into the cold, it'll almost seem soothing, it might actually not induce shiv... It might take away the shiver that you had. So here's a potential kind of sets reps protocol that you can play with. Find a temperature then induce a shiver for you. That's going to vary depending on your cold tolerance and how cold adapted you are. One to three, maybe five times a week, get in until you... Or get under the shower or whatever it is, until you start to shiver. Genuinely shiver. Then after about a minute or so, get out, spend one to three minutes out, but don't dry off, get back in for anywhere from one to three minutes, but try and access the shiver point again. And you might do three repetitions of that. So it's three times in and three times out total. Okay? That's a great starting place. And what you don't want to do is build up your tolerance to cold so fast, that pretty soon you're able to resist the shiver, because remember the shiver is the source of the succinate release that will trigger brown fat thermogenesis. So if you'd like to see this protocol spelled out, you can access it zero cost at a website"}
{"question": "Will a child who has been treated for ADHD with medication need to continue taking it for the rest of their life, and what are the factors that determine the need for long-term use?", "doc_id": "sxgCC4H1dl8_16", "video_id": "sxgCC4H1dl8", "video_title": "Adderall, Stimulants & Modafinil for ADHD: Short- & Long-Term Effects | Huberman Lab Podcast", "video_header": "ADHD Medications: Individuality, Doses, Tapering & Long-Term Use", "segment_idx": "16", "time_start": "1:05:12", "time_end": "1:13:26", "context": "the other common question is if a child has been treated with these ADHD meds during development do they need to continue on those drugs indefinitely and the short answer to this is it depends and that can be a somewhat frustrating answer I realize but the good news is it's something that can be assessed in a fairly straightforward way let's recall that the use of these drugs to treat ADHD is designed to accomplish two things it's designed to improve the function of those neural circuits that allow a child to focus and it's also designed to increase the strength of those circuits to effectively teach the circuits how to learn what focus is in other words these drugs are designed in some cases to be used and then withdrawn later because the circuits that they helped build up are functioning well in some cases however the circuits that underlie Focus are not going to be able to function at the level required for normal healthy life progression unless there's continued application of the drug so how would this work in the real world context well I think any child or adolescent or person younger than 25 that's taken these drugs has no doubt achieved some level of neuroplasticity of the neural circuits related to all the things we call Focus I and I want to be very clear there's no single brain area or set of brain circuits for what I'm referring to as Focus because after all Focus involves test switching Focus involves all sorts of different cognitive operations depending on what we're focusing on right the focusing on a sport is basically a practice of directing one's attention in different locations at different moments focusing on studying is an entirely different pattern of focus altogether but the point being if a person 25 years or younger takes a drug that increases dopamine and norepinephrine and assuming that things are working meaning the dose is right they're achieving better ability to focus etc those circuits are going to get stronger and it seems entirely reasonable in fact it was supported by the psychiatrist that I spoke to prior to this episode that people who've been on ADHD meds for any point of time prior to 25 talk to their psychiatrist about what tapering off those drugs in order to examine whether or not they still need those drugs would look like now I mentioned the word taper because there is a withdrawal potential of Simply stopping these drugs very quickly because they do ramp up dopamine and norepinephrine even though they increase plasticity of the neural circuits for focus and mood and motivation if one very abruptly ceases taking any of these drugs it does not feel good that drop in dopamine that one inevitably experiences is almost always associated with lethargy with depressed mood with feeling not good in a number of ways and of course challenges in Focus so anytime one is going to go off one of these drugs or sample what it is to even reduce dosage that has to be done in close communication with a board-certified psychiatrist at the same time it was made very clear to me from ADHD expert psychiatrists that reductions in dosage over time often are optimal for a patient okay and this gets to the whole issue of dosage generally you know I spend a good amount of time talking to somebody who prescribes these drugs both to children and adults about dosage ranges and I don't want to spend too much time on this from the perspective of how much one should take in fact I don't want anyone to think that what I'm about to say should dictate what they should take specifically because that's something that really has to be worked out on an individual basis but it is worth noting that if you look at the studies on Adderall and Methylphenidate but you'll see it is a pretty broad range in those studies and that's because some of the studies used people that were already taking these drugs and asked them to participate in neuroimaging studies other studies actually put people on these drugs for the very first time or adjusted their dosage and so you'll see a tremendous range of drug doses explored for instance you will see anywhere from 10 to 40 milligrams of Adderall per day you'll see anywhere from 10 to 60 milligrams of Ritalin per day and here we could easily be talking about studies on children or adults with respect to Vyvanse you'll see that the dosages tend to be much higher in part that's because vivance has if you recall it's that lysine which is a big molecule stuck on D amphetamine which is a smaller molecule and so the dosages of Vyvanse tend to be in the hundreds of milligram ranges but most of that 100 milligrams of Vyvanse is not going to be the damphetamine it's going to be the lysine which doesn't do anything in the context of treating the brain it's just there to control the slow release so it's thought that 100 milligrams of Vyvanse translates to roughly nine milligrams of Adderall and on and on and actually it's pretty hard to translate between dosages of different drugs in any direct way and in speaking with a psychiatrist expert in ADHD in preparation for this episode he made very clear that it is extremely extremely difficult to predict how a child or adult will react to a given dosage of any of these drugs so much so in fact that he anecdotally reported to me that one of his patients is a male 3 100 pounds diagnosed with ADHD and who achieves tremendous relief from just 2.5 milligrams of Adderall per day and at the same time he has two patients both of whom are sisters so they're genetically related who are in the 120 to 140 pound range who did not respond well at all for the treatment of their ADHD until their dosages were very very high and if I tell you these dosages I just want to warn you in advance I'm not suggesting anyone explore these dosages without of course the approval of their psychiatrist turns out that neither of these two young women responded at all to ADHD medication until they achieved dosages in the range of 180 in the case of one sister and 240 milligrams in the case of the other sister per day which is an astronomically high dose on the face of it but this physician again board certified physician expert in adiation verified for me that indeed neither of them experience any discomfort or side effects that led them to not want to take the drug but of course that amount of Adderall could send somebody else into an absolute psychotic fit could potentially even cause cardiac arrest I mean it's remarkable the ranges of Adderall that are used effectively in children and adults and this is true for a lot of the other sympathomimetics used to treat ADHD and of course a good psychiatrist will always assess dosage as it relates to positive benefits you know relief of symptoms so relief of impulsivity relief of hyperactivity improvements and ability to focus and of course they they are going to consider side effects any uncomfortable adverse effects that come from taking the drug at a given dosage or taking the drug at all now of course this all begs the question of why such tremendous variation is this due to genetic differences in the amount of dopamine or norepinephrine that people make it appears that the major underlying factor for why people require such vastly different dosages of these sympathomimetics for the relief of ADHD has to do with the different enzymes or levels of enzymes that people make which metabolize these drugs both in the brain and body and unfortunately there is no simple blood test or saliva test or test of any kind that can predict how someone will respond to these drugs so the most logical and safe way to assess dosage is to start with the lowest possible effective dose and to increase only as necessary in order to achieve the positive benefits while of course paying attention to any side effects that might arise a question that comes up from time to time when discussing the long-term"}

It's really an opportunity for the brain to start to explore different roles that people take, how they work as individuals and as pairs and in larger groups. And to do that in a low stakes environment, right? You wouldn't want this to be worked out on the battlefield or when searching for food or in some high stakes environment where the survival of the species was important. It appears that these circuitry for play evolved. So that rules and contingencies around who's most important, whether or not the group is important, whether or not individuals are going to be leaders or followers, et cetera, that can be explored in a low stakes environment. Now there are hundreds of different types of play and hundreds of different types of contingency testing. But the key theme here is that play allows children and adults for that matter to explore different outcomes in a kind of low stakes environment. If you're playing a board game or a card game, you might get really into that game, but unless there's a lot of money on the table, so to speak, or you're really playing for something important or unless your ego is swollen way out of proportion, to reality, if you lose, you might not feel good about it, but it's truly not the end of the world. And if you win, you might feel really good about it, but you're not really incredible. You were just incredible in that particular situation for that particular moment, it doesn't really transform the rest of your life, unless that game is of a particular type for sport for instance. We'll talk about sport later. So the key theme here is that play is contingency testing. play is contingency testing under conditions where the stakes are sufficiently low, that individuals should feel comfortable assuming different roles, even roles that they're not entirely comfortable within their outside life. And that all relates again to the release of these endogenous opioids, in this brain center periaqueductal gray and the way that it allows the prefrontal cortex in a very direct way I mean, truly it allows it in a biological way to expand the number of operations that it can run, and start thinking about, oh, well, okay. Normally I'm kind of a loner and I like to read and work and you know, hang out alone maybe and play alone but you know okay, I'll play a board game or a game of tennis where I have a partner and we're going to play as partners against two other people. Okay, that's a little uncomfortable, but I'll do it. And in doing that, you discover certain ways in which you are proficient in certain ways, in which you are less proficient, you discover that the other person actually tends to cheat a little bit or the other person is extremely rigid about the rules, or maybe it is extremely rigid about the way they organize their pieces on the board, or they're crossing the line into your side of the tennis court. There are all sorts of things that we learn in these rather low stake scenarios. That's the key theme here. So before I continue, I just want to point to a tool that anyone can use,"}
{"question": "How can we effectively use AI to mitigate the psychological impact of its potential risks, such as theft, harm, and misinformation, and create a safer online environment?", "doc_id": "yixIc1Ai6jM_23", "video_id": "yixIc1Ai6jM", "video_title": "Marc Andreessen: How Risk Taking, Innovation & Artificial Intelligence Transform Human Experience", "video_header": "Concerns about AI", "segment_idx": "23", "time_start": "2:12:46", "time_end": "2:17:55", "context": "AI with the constraints that we discover we need in order to rein in safety and things of that sort. Not unlike social media, not unlike the Internet. Marc Andreessen: Not unlike what we should have done with nuclear power. Andrew Huberman: And in terms of the near infinite number of ways that AI can be envisioned to harm us, how do you think we should cope with that psychologically? Because I can imagine a lot of people listening to this conversation are thinking, okay, that all sounds great, but there are just too many what ifs that are terrible, right? What if the machines take over? What if the silly example I gave earlier, but what if one day I could log into my hard earned bank account and it's all gone? The AI version of myself ran off with someone else, and with all my money, my AI coach abandoned me for somebody else. After it learned all the stuff that I taught it. It took off with somebody else stranded. And it has my bank account numbers, like this kind of thing. Marc Andreessen: You could really make this scenario horrible, right, if you kept going? Andrew Huberman: Yeah, well, we can throw in a benevolent example as well to counter it, but it's kind of fun to think about where the human mind goes, right? Marc Andreessen: Yeah. So first I say we've got to separate the real problems from the fake problems. And so there's a lot. A lot of the science fiction scenarios I think are just not real. And the ones that you decided as an example, like, it's. That's not what is going to happen. And I can explain why that's not what's going to happen. There's a set of fake ones, and the fake ones are the ones that just aren't, I think, technologically grounded, that aren't rational. It's the AI is going to wake up and decide to kill us all. It's going to develop the kind of agency where it's going to steal our money and our spouse and everything else, our kids. That's not how it works. And then there's also all these concerns, destruction of society concerns. And this is misinformation, hate speech, deepfakes, like all that stuff, which I don't think is actually a real problem. And then people have a bunch of economic concerns around what's going to take all the jobs and all those kinds of things. We could talk about that. I don't think that's actually the thing that happens. But then there are two actual real concerns that I actually do very much agree with. And one of them is what you said, which is bad people doing bad things. And there's a whole set of things to be done inside there. The big one is we should use AI to build defenses against all the bad things, right? And so, for example, there's a concern AI is going to make it easier for bad people to build pathogens, design pathogens in labs, which bad scientists can do today, but this is going to make it easier, easier to do. Well, obviously, we should have the equivalent of an Operation Warpspeed, operating in perpetuity anyway. But then we should use AI to build much better bio defenses. And we should be using AI today to design, like, for example, full spectrum vaccines against every possible form of pathogen. So defensive mechanism hacking, you can use AI to build better defense tools, right? And so you should have a whole new kind of security suite wrapped around you, wrapped around your data, wrapped around your money, where you're having AI repel attacks, disinformation, hate speech, deepfakes, all that stuff. You should have an AI filter when you use the Internet, where you shouldn't have to figure out whether it's really me or whether it's a made up thing. You should have an AI assistant that's doing that for you. Andrew Huberman: Oh, yeah. I mean, these little banners and cloaks that you see on social media like \"this has been deemed misinformation.\" If you're me, you always click because you're like, what's behind the scrim? I don't always look at this image is gruesome type thing. Sometimes I just pass on that. But if it's something that seems debatable, of course you look well. Marc Andreessen: And you should have an AI assistant with you when you're on the Internet. And you should be able to tell that AI assistant what you want, right? So, yes, I want the full experience. Show me everything. I want it from a particular point of view. And I don't want to hear from these other people who I don't like, by the way. It's going to be, my eight year old is using this. I don't want anything that's going to cause a problem. And I want everything filtered and AI based filters like that that you program and control are going to work much better and be much more honest and straightforward and clear and so forth than what we have today. Anyway, basically, what I want people to do is think, every time you think of a risk of how it can be used, just think of like, okay, we can use it to build a countermeasure. And the great thing about the countermeasures is they can not only offset AI risks, they can offset other risks. Right? Because we already live in a world where pathogens are a problem, right? We ought to have better vaccines anyway. We already live in a world where there's cyber hacking and cyber terrorism. They already live in a world where there's bad content on the Internet. And we have the ability now to build much better AI powered tools to deal with all those things. Andrew Huberman: I also love the idea of the AI physicians. Getting decent health care in this country is so difficult, even for people who have means or insurance. I mean, the number of phone calls and waits that you have to go through to get a referral to see a specialist, it's absurd. The process is absurd. I mean, it makes one partially or frankly ill just to go through the process of having to do all that. I don't know how anyone does it. And granted, I don't have the highest degree of patience, but I'm pretty patient, and it drives me insane to even just get remedial care. So I can think of a lot of benevolent uses of AI.

{"question": "Are there any psychiatric medications or treatments that have been proven to be highly effective in treating severe mental illnesses, such as depression and schizophrenia?", "doc_id": "w9MXqXBZy9U_5", "video_id": "w9MXqXBZy9U", "video_title": "Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Understanding & Healing the Mind", "video_header": "Drugs That Work for Brain Illness", "segment_idx": "5", "time_start": "22:48", "time_end": "26:55", "context": "are there any very good treatments for psychiatric disease? Meaning, are there currently any pills, potions, forms of communication that reliably work every time, or work in most patients? And could you give a couple examples of great successes of psychiatry if they exist? - Yes. Yeah, we are fortunate. And this coming back to my, you know, the joking between my wife and myself in terms of neurology and psychiatry, we actually in psychiatry, despite the depths of the mystery we struggled with, many of our treatments are actually... We may be doing better than some other specialties in terms of actually causing therapeutic benefit for patients. We do help patients, the patients who suffer from... By the way, both medications and talk therapy have been shown to be extremely effective in many cases, for example, people with panic disorder, cognitive behavioral therapy, just working with words, helping people identify the early signs of when they're starting to move toward a panic attack, what are the cognitions that are happening? You can train people to derail that, and you can very potently treat panic disorder that way. - How long does something like that take on average? - For a motivated, insightful patient, you can have a very cookbooky series of sessions, that's six to 12 sessions, or even less for someone who's very insightful and motivated and it can have a very powerful effect that quickly. And that's just with words, there are many psychiatric medications that are very effective for the conditions that they're treating. Anti-psychotic medications, they have side effects, but boy, do they work! They really can clear up particularly the positive symptoms of schizophrenia for example, the auditory hallucinations, the paranoia, people's lives can be turned around by these- - We should clarify positive symptoms. You mean not positive in the qualitative sense, you mean positive meaning that the appearance of something abnormal. - Exactly. Yeah. Thank you for that clarification. When we say positive symptoms, we do mean the addition of something that wasn't there before, like a hallucination or a paranoia, and that stands in contrast to the negative symptoms where something is taken away, and these are patients who are withdrawn. They have what we call thought blocking. They can't even progress forward in a sequence of thoughts. Both of those can be part of schizophrenia, the hallucinations and the paranoia are more effectively treated right now, but they are effectively treated. And then, this is a frustrating, and yet heartening aspect of psychiatry. There are treatments like electroconvulsive therapy, where it's extremely effective for depression. We have patients who nothing else works for them, where they can't tolerate medications, and you can administer under a very safe, controlled condition, where the patient's body is not moving. They're put into a very safe situation where the body doesn't move or cease, it's just an internal process that's triggered in the brain. This is an extraordinarily effective treatment for treatment-resistant depression. At the same time, I find it as heartening as it is to see patients respond to this who have severe depression, I'm also frustrated by it. Why can't we do something more precise than this, for these very severe cases? And people have sought for decades to understand, how is it that a seizure is leading to the relief of depression? And we don't know the answer yet. We would love to do that. People are working hard on that, but that is a treatment that does work too. In all of these cases though in psychiatry, the frustrating thing is that we don't have the level of understanding that a cardiologist has in thinking about the heart. You know, the heart is, we now know it's a pump. It's pumping blood. and so you can look at everything about how it's working or not working, in terms of that frame, it's clearly a pump. We don't really have that level of, what is the circuit really there for in psychiatry? And that's what is missing. That's what we need to find, so we can design truly effective and specific treatments."}
{"question": "Does Fadogia agrestis supplementation increase testosterone levels in individuals with low luteinizing hormone (LH) levels?", "doc_id": "ncSoor2Iw8k_28", "video_id": "ncSoor2Iw8k", "video_title": "Dr. Kyle Gillett: How to Optimize Your Hormones for Health & Vitality", "video_header": "Fadogia Agrestis, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Frequency", "segment_idx": "28", "time_start": "1:52:28", "time_end": "1:56:39", "context": "this Nigerian shrub or this extract from Nigerian shrubs that at least in my experience, in my read of the literature, has the potential to increase testosterone and probably other hormones as well by way of increasing luteinizing hormone. Something that we haven't really talked about much up until now. What are your thoughts about Fadogia agrestis? What are your ideas about the proposed mechanism or mechanisms and where might this be useful for people on or off hormone replacement therapy? - Yeah, Fadogia agrestis has just reached a point where we have enough evidence till we know it probably helps both with luteinizing hormone release, which stimulates Leydig cells in the testes to produce more testosterone. And probably with LH receptor sensitivity as well, which is a good combination of the two. It does come from the Nigerian shrub, but there is not quite enough evidence for me to be able to say it's safe for someone to take this all the time, which again, full disclosure, that's why I recommended that we recommended for people to cycle this supplement. So three weeks on, one week off, that's likely safe. The only toxicity studies in general are in rats and in humans, it looks quite safe. - My understanding is that the toxicity studies in rats showed toxicity to the testicular cells, so that's certainly concerning, but that the dosages that were used or translating the dosages used to humans would lead to a situation where the dosages that humans would have to take would be very, very large. So the amount of, I no longer take Fadogia, but I took it at 600 milligrams per day for a long time. And I ceased taking it because I was experimenting with other things and I didn't want to confound those things. Not because I had any negative side effects. In fact, I was monitoring blood work, and other biological parameters that would've told me if there was testicular toxicity, and there wasn't. Let's put it that way. - Yeah. I think it's extremely safe. And I'm just not convinced that there's enough overwhelming evidence for longterm consistent administration. - So do you recommend this to people who are not taking TRT and do you recommend to men and women? - Yeah, so if you have a really high LH, then there's probably a gonadal issue, whether it's heat damage to the testes, a varicocele, a history of testicular cancer where your LH is going to be higher. So if your LH is already very high, increasing it even more is probably not going to help. However, if your LH is low, then obviously try to find out is it low? Is it deficient or is it just a little bit low? If it's low and you don't have an issue with prolactin, you don't have an issue with opioid receptor antagonism, and naltrexone can actually potentially help antagonize that to increase LH as well, especially in people recovering from opiates or likely even alcohol. So you're looking for a subclinical secondary hypogonadism, which is essentially, just think of that as low LH. So in people with that lower LH and their estrogen is fine and their prolactin is fine, then Fadogia is a particularly good option. - Interesting, so three weeks on, one week off for 600 milligrams Fadogia, 400 milligrams tongkat ali, Indonesian tongkat ali could potentially you be good. And of course, everyone should always check with their physician, clear this, do blood work, et cetera. I always say we don't just say that to protect us. We say that to protect you, meaning the consumer. And it's very, very important. You don't want to get, you don't want to fly blind with any of the stuff. You want to do blood work, right? - That's the catch-22 with supplements is most of them are safer than medications, but the only difference between them and a medication is one's prescribed and one's not. - And oftentimes with supplements, it's unclear whether or not what's listed on the bottle is actually what's in the bottle but. - Yeah. - But I think there are a number of reputable brands now. The other supplement I want to talk about in terms of testosterone augmentation is boron. What is boron thought to do? Does it actually do that?"}
{"question": "Do I need to eat a lot of blueberries every day to get the cognitive benefits of anthocyanins, or can I get them through supplementation?", "doc_id": "E7W4OQfJWdw_11", "video_id": "E7W4OQfJWdw", "video_title": "Nutrients For Brain Health & Performance | Huberman Lab Podcast #42", "video_header": "Anthocyanins, Dark Skin Berries (Tool 6-10mg/day (Extract), 1-2 cups Berries)", "segment_idx": "11", "time_start": "36:28", "time_end": "41:15", "context": "and I do eat meat, but I don't actively seek out creatine in my diet. Rather, I use supplementation in order to hit that five grams per day threshold. Next on the list of foods that are beneficial for brain health is one that you've probably seen pictures of online, because there seems to be a practice of putting pictures of blueberries and other dark berries next to any title that says, \"Foods that benefit your brain\". There are a lot of foods out there that have been purported to improve brain function. The interesting thing about blueberries and other berries, blackberries, dark currants, any of these thin-skinned berries that are purpleish in color, is that they contain what are called anthocyanins. Anthocyanins actually have some really nice data to support the fact that they improve brain function. Now, whether or not it is direct effects on neurons, or whether or not it is by lowering inflammation, or some other modulatory effect, isn't quite clear. But I think by now, there's enough data to support the fact that eating a cup or two of blueberries pretty often, every day, or maybe you have blackberries, or maybe it's black currants, that these anthocyanins are good for us, that they are enhancing our overall wellbeing at a number of different levels. And just to give you a couple examples of where there are actually peer-reviewed studies to support those statements, the anthocyanins of which blueberries and other dark berries are rich in have been shown to reduce the amount of DNA damage, has been shown to reduce significantly, although, albeit, slightly, excuse me, cognitive decline. And that particular study was supplementation of a blueberry extract. I'll talk about the difference between extract and actual blueberries in a moment. But supplementation of blueberry extract in offsetting cognitive decline in elderly people. So what constitutes elderly is always a little bit of a debate and a discussion. But in this case, what they did, is they supplemented with somewhere between 428, I don't know why they selected 428, and 598 milligrams of anthocyanins daily for 12 weeks was associated with improvements on verbal learning and memory. And they had some other beneficial changes that were within the bodily organs, and blood glucose regulation, and so forth. Positive changes. But that's one study. In this case, elderly meant 65 or older. That study, and a number of studies like it, looking at things like mildly enhanced memory, reduced insulin levels, reduced oxidation of LDL, these sorts of things, have basically created a situation where anytime you Google or look up foods that enhance brain function, you're going to see a picture of a blueberry or some other berry, because of these anthocyanins. I personally don't supplement anthocyanins. I do like blueberries. I eat blueberries when they're in season. I love them. I'm what you would call a drive-by blueberry eater. Like if there are blueberries in a bowl on a table, and I'm walking by, I just have to scoop them up, like some sort of bear, or other animal, and pop them in my mouth. So blueberries don't last long around me. One of the issues with berries, like blueberries, and blackberries, and so forth, is that quality sources of them can be pretty expensive. And then, of course, when they're not in season, they're hard to get, and so that's why some people will supplement with them. So that range of about 400 to about 600 milligrams per day seems to be the minimum threshold for getting a cognitive effect in these elderly patients. In that case, they were patients. A good review about the anthocyanins potentially contributing to offsetting cognitive decline in things like Alzheimer's, and also enhancing brain function in people that don't have Alzheimer's, is a review by Afzal, A-F-Z-A-L, that was published in 2019. We will also provide a link to that study in the caption. When one looks across the total batch of studies that are out there on this, it appears, that if one is going to supplement with blueberry extract to get the anthocyanin effect on cognition, dosages of somewhere between 5 1/2 or about 11 grams seem optimal with the higher end, closer to 10 or 11 grams being more beneficial. The blueberry eaters out there like me, who prefer to get their anthocyanins from the actual berries, it appears that somewhere between 60 to 120 grams of fresh blueberries each day is the way that you can get sufficient anthocyanins to at least shift your system, or bias your brain towards these enhanced cognitive effects. So we've got EPA fatty acids,"}

"time_end": "34:05", "context": "young girlwoman because we're talking about puberty right so I don't know what the exact nomenclature is there you know my experience is I'll I'll offend and um somebody no matter what um but a girl who under goes puberty right so a young woman um who's maybe 13 or so so she's early teens um under goes puberty and therefore is continuing to lose eggs from the Vault um but now is undergoing uh presumably roughly every 28 days manarchy but let's talk about this 28 days thing because I think a lot of people think that um quote unquote normal menstruation is always 28 days and and we know that's not true so what is the the range of uh normal durations between um menstration uh Cycles or duration of the menstruation cycle and let's also Define when the menstration cycle starts probably for the males mostly in the audience sure sure so let's think through the cycle we'll do a quick one over and then answer the questions so what we think of is cycle day one or when you're going to say this starts is going to be the day that you start bleeding so that's actually shedding the endometrial lining from what grew the last time so any spotting even would be considered day one okay so it is we can get back to it but there's problematic if you have a lot of spotting before that full flow starts a day or so can be really normal just as the body is adjusting to the drop in progesterone but let's just start at the beginning day one you have a period of Menses this is when you're actually bleeding at this time period we like to think about all of those new eggs being out of the Vault being susceptible to that FSH which of course is that well-named hormone because it stimulates a follicle to grow and each egg is in a follicle that egg starts to grow and makes estrogen that estrogen stimulates the proliferation of the lining of the uterus and preparation for potentially that pregnancy that may come and also that estrogen makes you feel really great right that's the follicular phase name so because that follicle is growing and it's an FSH dominant phase where you have a lot of estrogen and people feel great when they have a lot of estrogen because women feel good with estrogen because of the relationship between estrogen and other neuromodulators like dopamine serotonin and and is that happening in parallel or are they somehow related like is estrogen controlling the release of Serotonin somehow and vice versa or are they just kind of coincidently happening in parallel we definitely think that there's more of a correlation causation than just coincidence because we know there's time periods of people are more depressed within your cycle correlating with those low estrogen levels and we know that when you go into menopause or you run out of eggs and you're now in a low estrogen phase we see a lot more of a depressed mood and you know anadon lack of response to things which would normally give you pleasure happens more frequently the female brain loves estrogen and it's protective against things like dementia so this is a time period where women are going to be more energetic they're going to have more energy more Focus this is the estrogen dominant phase of the cycle and when you have seen that estrogen at its high levels which it's only made from a mature follicle and it's very specific 200 pams per milliliter for 50 hours that's the brain's clue okay we must have a mature egg and it can send out that surge of LH or lutenizing hormone and now you ovulate and when you ovulate the follicle opens up releases closes back and then it's the Corpus ludum and we've entered the ludal phase and the Corpus ludum as the name suggests a corpus it's like a body that's basically the it's Bas it's basically the the corpse of of what yeah in sheath the egg before um and it what I find so amazing I mean biology so beautiful right it instead of just taking that tissue and saying okay like let's just discard this or um that becomes the trigger for the next phase of the it is essential for life right the Corpus ludum which makes progesterone opens and closes the implantation window it is what allows somebody to get pregnant and for our species to continue it's so it's extremely fascinating and that Corpus ludum gets stimulated to produce progesterone imp pulses throughout the entire ludal phase because it's still controlled by the brain unless you get pregnant and then in that ludal phase progesterone is fascinating it's trying to protect you from things which could potentially harm your baby so suddenly now you have less energy you want to sleep more you want to eat more you maybe do not want to have sex as much because your body is suddenly saying let's just protect this potential implantation that you're going to have if that pregnancy doesn't come the Corpus ludum can only live 12 to 14 days it has a very distinct lifespan and then it dies your estrogen and progesterone both drop you bleed starting over the next cycle and a new group of follicles comes out to be released and the reason why walking through that very succinctly but is important when you're asking how long is the normal cycle because the ludal phase is pretty set at 12 to 14 days the follicular phase can vary in person to person and what we know though is for one individual if your menstrual cycle your reproductive hormones are working right it should be relatively constant for you and so if your periods are every 24 days but they've always been every 24 to 25 days then that's not concerning and if your periods are every 33 days but they've always been every 33 days then that's not concerning but we do get concerned when there's a change in your period or we get concerned when people have what I like to say is irregularly regular periods because what you'll see textbooks tell you is that your periods could be as short short as 21 days as long as 35 days and that can all be normal but people will hop between them and they'll have one cycle that is 24 days in length from day one to the last day before the next day one then the next cycle is 32 and then it's 26 and then it's 34 and that's not normal that's too irregular and that can be a sign that something is not communicating correctly within your reproductive hormones so what I tell patients is in general your period should be less than 35 days apart and you should be able to look at a calendar and with your finger put a finger on the date and within a couple days of accuracy be able to predict when your period's coming and if you can't there could likely be something that is interfering with the hormonal signals between the brain and the ovary and one of the biggest really one of the only things we see as women start to have fewer eggs in the vault is a shortening of their cycle so you have a regular period and suddenly now you have less eggs in the vault so less are coming out each month and when the brain sends out that FSH signal now there's fewer eggs so it's not getting as dilute and you have one starting to respond sooner so suddenly you're ovulating shorter faster in your cycle you're ovulating on cycle date 9 instead of 14 your ludal phase is still set but the person who comes to see me and says my period have always been 28 to 30 days but now they're every 24 I just figure it's no big deal I am have red flags going off everywhere because I'm now really concerned that potentially their ovarian reserve has dropped to a point where we are starting to see clinical changes now of course things like thyroid and prolactin and other hormones can also cause such changes but that's why you'll hear most reproductive endocrinologists say your periods a Vital sign and what we really mean is the regularity at which it comes and the predictability of it is telling us if your hormones are all communicating in a normal fashion or if something could potentially be off as we all know quality nutrition influences of course our physical health but also our"}
{"question": "How does restricting my eating window to a shorter period, such as 4-6 hours, affect my body's ability to exercise and respond to hunger cues?", "doc_id": "17O5mgXZ9ZU_10", "video_id": "17O5mgXZ9ZU", "video_title": "How Our Hormones Control Our Hunger, Eating & Satiety", "video_header": "Satchin Panda, Circadian Eating & Intermittent(ish) Fasting", "segment_idx": "10", "time_start": "27:21", "time_end": "29:31", "context": "who was a colleague of mine when my lab was in San Diego at the Salk Institute, who really is one of the pioneers of this restricted feeding window work and has done a beautiful work. He has a book that's excellent called 'The Circadian Code' that I highly recommend. And he's done a lot of important work on neurons in the retina, that control circadian timing, but also the relationship between feeding windows and health. And he's sort of among the major proponents I should say, of circadian eating, that means eating during the daytime, not at night or intermittent fasting, restricting feeding windows to anywhere from four to six to eight hours. I'll use myself as an example of the transition from regular feeding schedule to a more intermittent-ish fasting, although I don't really fall into true intermittent fasting. So I was one of these people that just got so accustomed to waking up and eating about an hour after I woke up. That to go from eating every three or four hours to eating twice a day, lunch and dinner, maybe a couple of snacks in the afternoon or something. At first it was excruciating. I remember thinking like, this is really brutal pushing out feeding. I didn't think I could exercise unless I had eaten first. We now know that during most all forms of exercise unless you're really focused on optimal performance like you've got to hit key lifts or you have to sprint at your maximum speed. And maybe even then that you can exercise faster just fine, because you're mainly relying on sources like glycogen from the liver, some undigested food sometimes, as gross as that may seem it's true, as well as body fat if the exercise about is extremely long. But what that means is that if you suddenly go from eating on a very regular schedule to skipping a meal, or pushing your meal timing out or shifting at all, you're going to have ghrelin in your system. And that ghrelin is going to stimulate the desire to eat by acting at the level of your brain. And it is indeed at that point, just mental. When we hear about just mental, just physical, it's really kind of the same thing 'cause it's all chemicals, brain and body. But it's the stimulation of neurons that anticipate feeding. You're stimulating the arcuate nucleus neurons that make you want to eat those AgRP neurons. So ghrelin stimulates the AgRP neurons, which makes you want to eat. So what can you do with this? What this means is, if you want to start shifting your feeding schedule"}

Do you think there's any reason to believe that rates of entry into and through puberty can predict overall rates of aging? In other words, if a kid is a slow burner, right? They basically acquire the traits of puberty slowly over many years. Can we make some course prediction that they are going to live a long time versus a kid that goes home for the summer and comes back a completely different organism or appearing to be a completely different organism. Like they basically age very quickly in the summer. Does that mean they're aging very quickly overall? - Well, yeah, I don't want to scare anybody. - Sure. - That there are studies that show that the slower you take to develop it also is predictive of having a longer, healthier life. And it may have something to do with growth hormone. We know that growth hormone is pro-aging. Anyone who's taking growth hormone, pay attention. - Just look at someone who's taking growth hormone. - Yeah. - They often will acquire these characteristics of vitality, like improved a smoothness of skin, but their whole body shape changes often. - Yeah, I mean you'll feel better for a short amount of time. You'll build up muscle, you feel great, but it's like burning your candle at both ends. Ultimately, if you want to live longer, you want less of that. And the animals that have been generated and mutants that have low growth hormone, or sometimes these are dwarfs, they live the longest by far. A guy in my lab, Michael Bankowski, he had the longest lived mouse, a mouse typically lives about two and a bit years. He had a mouse that lived five years and he gave it chloric restriction, so fasting, combined with one of these dwarf mutations, low growth hormone, I think he called it Yoda. You look at who lives the longest, it's the really small people. This is a bit anecdotal, but it sounds like it might be true, is that the people who played the munchkins in the Wizard of Oz, many of them went on to live into their nineties and beyond. - Really? - Yeah. - Huh, amazing. - And are there are some Lauren dwarfs as well? There are dwarf mutations in South America and they seem to be protected against many of the diseases of aging.

detriment to having a piece of glass or a piece of plastic on the front of your eye all the time and the reason I ask is not because I think we should live necessarily exactly like our ancestors but it's a pretty bizarre adaptation to put a lens directly onto the front of the eye you have to imagine that the cells and tissues there are accustomed to getting a certain amount of oxygen they're accustomed to getting a certain amount of interaction with the environment and and you also now adding another surface the way that the tears are going to interact with the um you know with the corny of the eye are probably changed and who knows maybe it doesn't make any negative difference at all but you know putting a contact lens on the front of the eye is you know about as close to putting a device on your brain as I can think of except for maybe the clear uh implant yeah yeah that's a great question now first of all um I want to distinguish uh there are few really medical uses for different kinds of contact lenses like scleral contact lenses for people have certain diseases there are other kinds but I think what we really want to talk about right now is just kind of the run-ofthe-mill I want to get my prescription taken care of but instead of wearing glasses I'm going to wear contacts contacts even the newest generation contacts yes they sort of uh change the tiar Dynamics on the surface of your ey they um uh they decrease the oxygen you know diffusion that's just sort of out in the air onto the surface of our eye onto the cells that are on the surface of our eye but most of us especially as we're younger have enough tier film Reserve enough oxygen Reserve that we can easily tolerate these polymer gel soft contact lenses and and wear them happily the advantage of contact lenses over glasses purely from the perspective of correcting your vision is that there's different elements of of of of the shape of your eye that need to be corrected if you need corrective lenses and so for example if your the basketball shape of your eye is a little too steep or a little too shallow that's what the standard glasses correct uh you may have been told that you have something called a stigmatism that's where instead of having a basketball shaped eye you have a slightly football-shaped eye it's not round in the same dimensions on both axes and again glasses can correct that but then there's higher order aberration in our corneas in the clear window in the front of our eyes or or to some degree in the lens inside the eye that are that are focusing the light that the glasses prescription can't correct but if you have nice smooth contact lens on the front it can correct so a lot of people who wear glasses and contacts will report that they have a much higher quality of vision with their contact lens correction than with their glasses correction and again in service of enjoying the best Vision that you can enjoy in your daily life that's an upside to seeing if contact could work for you now there's another element though and that's like gosh is there a risk of contact lenses and especially as we age um we have less tear film Reserve so contacts may become less tolerable as we age and the other thing is being really good about the cleaning because you know the contacts can trap bacteria or fungus and if you get a corial infection from a contact lens it actually can be quite devastating to your cornea even if you successfully treat the infection you can be left with some corneal scarring thankfully this happens very rarely but when it does happen it can be quite difficult on you know on the person thereafter to sort of suffer through having maybe a scar from that infection on the surface of their cornea that they that leads to some blurring vision for example so we always recommend that if you're going to wear contacts that you be really attentive to whether you're tolerating them well and then also to be really attentive to the recommended use and cleaning of the contact lenses I actually recommend that even though they're a little more expensive to afford that people should almost always be just using the daily contact lenses that they don't have to clean or use for uh you know two weeks or four- week period so these are disposable contact lens disposable and I hate to think of you know I don't know filling our oceans or what have you with more more more polymer plastic but at least the contact lenses are small and it's much safer for your eye to use a daily disposable than to use a two we or a 4 we and be responsible for the cleaning the other thing to be really responsible about is sleeping in them overnight because overnight when your eyelids are closed of course now you're getting even less oxygen to the surface of your eye and actually most bacteria especially many of the Infectious bacteria to our bodies and to the surface of our eye are actually bacteria that don't really like oxygen and so we've got a low risk of getting bacterial infections on the surface of our eye but if we use contacts too much don't clean them or sleep in them overnight when our eyelids are closed and now there's even less oxygen kind of helping keep the surface more more clean if you will uh that increases the risk a lot so being really good with the recommended use and cleaning of the contacts is critical considering daily use contacts you don't have to and look most contacts are going to be the two we or four-week kind where you put them in the cleaning solution overnight each time give them a good rinse and put them back in the next say and again most people 99.99 some perent of people are going to do just fine with that follow the instructions and never get into trouble as we age they're going to become less tolerable people are going to say I used to wear my contacts for 12 hours now my eyes feel really dry after six or eight or 10 hours maybe some years after that they say gosh I could barely use it for four hours I only use them when I go out on a Saturday night uh and and that's okay you can you can you can back off as you need to back off but in the meantime if it

{"question": "What are the key biological mechanisms that underlie human attachment and love, and how do they differ from those found in other species, such as the prairie vole?", "doc_id": "gMRph_BvHB4_4", "video_id": "gMRph_BvHB4", "video_title": "The Science of Love, Desire and Attachment", "video_header": "Animal Studies, Vasopressin & Monogamy", "segment_idx": "4", "time_start": "19:01", "time_end": "22:02", "context": "There are biological mechanisms to desire, love and attachment, that's abundantly clear. Now there's a robust and very large literature in animal models. What I mean by that are field studies and laboratory studies in primates of different kinds, such as macaque monkeys or bonobos. People have looked at these sorts of things, believe it or not, in ducks, in laboratory mice, in different types of birds, et cetera. And if you look at that literature, you can essentially find biological examples in the animal kingdom for just about any behavior that you can easily map to human behavior. So for instance, there's a species of animal called the prairie vole. In one portion of the United States, this prairie vole species is monogamous. They only mate with one other prairie vole, only raise the young with one other prairie vole for their entire life. And in another region of the United States, the same species of animal, prairie vole, will mate with many individuals, they're non-monogamous. And the major difference, at least as far as we know between the prairie voles in one location and another location is the levels of a molecule called vasopressin in the brain and body. Vasopressin is present in humans. It has numerous biological roles. It's responsible, for instance, for controlling the amount of urine that you excrete, the amount of water that you retain, and for sexual desire, as well as mate seeking. Levels of vasopressin in prairie voles are strongly determinant of whether or not a prairie vole is going to be a monogamous or non-monogamous. Why do I raise this? Well, I raise this because the literature on prairie voles is quite beautiful and has been discussed quite a lot in the popular press. You can look it up with an easily, just Web Edge search. You'll find lots of information about this, lots of news articles about this, and lots of interpretations as to how vasopressin might be involved in similar or different mechanisms in humans. Now, I don't have a problem with mapping animal studies to humans. I think there's certainly a place for that. But if we just lean back and look at the giant mass of studies in animals and their mating behavior, and their mate selection behavior, you can essentially find examples of anything. You can find examples of polygamy, you can find examples of cheating, of infidelity, you can find examples of all sorts of different behaviors that in your own mind, you can map to human behavior. But it's really hard to make the leap from animal models to humans in any kind of direct way. And so thankfully there's been tremendous work done in the last mainly 20 years or so, looking at human mate selection, human desire, human love and human attachment. So we're mainly going to focus on those studies today, and where appropriate, we will map those findings back to the findings in animals to see if there's some universal truths or some universal principles about how the neural circuits and biological mechanisms work. But by and large, we're going to focus on human studies today. So unless I say otherwise, the data that I'm referring to today are entirely from human beings. So let's talk about attachment and attachment styles."}

Well, we have done, of course, work on some athletes. But in general, we don't do research on our teams, our varsity teams. So they have their own protocols. They have their own training program. - Yeah. They don't like us to get too close to them. I work with some of these folks in the coaches and they are very skeptical, with good reason also. And the reason I ask is that when you see these Pac-10 or Division I college athletes, and then you see their peers, there's clearly a difference, right? I mean, they are pedigreed at throughout, right? And more typical folks also have different goals. They may not want to get infinitely stronger or perform more endurance work.

{"question": "What are some of the ways in which martial arts, such as Jujitsu, can create a sense of intimacy and bonding between practitioners, similar to physical contact in other forms of human connection?", "doc_id": "VRvn3Oj5r3E_23", "video_id": "VRvn3Oj5r3E", "video_title": "Dr. Lex Fridman: Machines, Creativity & Love", "video_header": "Martial Arts", "segment_idx": "23", "time_start": "2:20:38", "time_end": "2:31:32", "context": "I know you are, Joe is, but years ago, I read a book that I really enjoyed, which is Sam Sheridan's book, \" A Fighter's Heart,\" he talks about all these different forms of martial arts. And maybe it was in the book, maybe it was in an interview, but he said that fighting, or being in physical battle with somebody, Jujitsu boxing or some other form of direct physical contact between two individuals creates this bond unlike any other. Because he said it's like a one night stand, you're sharing bodily fluids with somebody that you barely know. - Yeah. - And I chuckled about it 'cause it's kind of funny and it kind of tongue in cheek. But at the same time, I think this is a fundamental way in which members of a species bond is through physical contact. And certainly, there are other forms, there's cuddling, and there's hand holding, and there's in their sexual intercourse, and there's all sorts of things. - What's cuddling? I haven't heard of it. - I heard this recently, I didn't know this term, but there's a term, they've turned the noun cupcake into a verb, cupcaking it turns out, I just learned about this. Cupcaking is when you spend time just cuddling. I didn't know about this. You heard it here first, although I heard it first just the other day. Cupcaking is actually a- - Cuddling is everything, it's not just like, is it in bed, or is it in the coach? Like what's cuddling? I do look up what cuddling is- - We need to look at this up and we need to define the variables. I think it definitely has to do with physical contact, I'm told, but in terms of battle, a competition, and the Sheridan quote, I'm just curious. So, do you get close, or feel a bond with people that, for instance, you rolled Jujitsu with, or even though you don't know anything else about them, was he right about this? - Yeah, I mean on many levels. He also has the book, what? \"A Fighter's Mind.\" - Yeah, that was the third one. He's actually an excellent writer. What's interesting about him, just briefly about Sheridan, I don't know him, but I did a little bit of research, he went to Harvard, he was an art major at Harvard, he claims all he did was smoke cigarettes and do art. I don't know if his art was any good. And I think his father was in the SEAL teams. And then when he got out of Harvard, graduated, he took off around the world learning all the forms of martial arts, and was early to the kind of ultimate fighting kind of mixed martial arts and things. Great book. Yeah, yeah. - It's amazing. I don't actually remember it, but I read it, and I remember thinking that was an amazing encapsulation of what makes fighting like the art, like what makes it compelling. I would say that there's so many ways that Jujitsu grappling, wrestling, combat sports in general, is like one of the most intimate things you could do. I don't know if I would describe in terms of bodily liquids and all those kinds of things. - I think he was more or less joking. - I think there's a few ways that it does that. So, one, because you're so vulnerable [sighs] So, the honesty of stepping on the mat and often all of us have ego thinking we're better than we are at this particular art. And then the honesty of being submitted, or being worse than you thought you are and just sitting with that knowledge, that kind of honesty, we don't get to experience it in most of daily life. We can continue living somewhat of an illusion of our conceptions of ourselves 'cause people are not going to hit us with the reality, the mat speaks only the truth, the reality just hits you. And that vulnerability is the same as like the loss of a loved one, though it's the loss of a reality that you knew before, you now have to deal with this new reality. And when you're sitting there in that vulnerability, and there's these other people that are also sitting in that vulnerability, you get to really connect like, fuck, like I'm not as special as I thought I was, and life is like not, life is harsher than I thought I was, and we're just sitting there with that reality, some of us can put words to them, some we can't. So, I think that definitely, is a thing that at least the intimacy. The other thing is the human contact. There's something about, I mean, like a big hug, like during COVID, very few people hugged me and I hugged them, and I always felt good when they did. Like we were all tested, and especially now we're vaccinated, but there's still people, this is true of San Francisco's, it's true in Boston, they want to keep, not only six feet away, but stay at home and never touch you. That loss of basic humanity is the opposite of what I feel in Jujitsu, where it was like that contact where you're like, I don't give a shit about whatever rules we're supposed to have in society where you have to keep a distance and all that kind of stuff. Just the hug, like the intimacy of a hug, that's like a good bear hug, and you're like just controlling another person, and also there is some kind of love communicated through just trying to break each other's arms. I don't exactly understand why violence is the such a close neighbor to love, but it is. - Well, in the hypothalamus, the neurons that control sexual behavior, but also non-sexual contact, are not just nearby the neurons that control aggression and fighting, they are salt and pepper with those neurons. It's a very interesting, and it almost sounds kind of risky and controversial and stuff, I'm not anthropomorphizing about what this means, but in the brain, those structures are interdigitated, you can't separate them except at a very fine level. And here, the way you describe it, is the same as a real thing. - I do want to make an interesting comment. Again, these are the things that could be taken out of context, but one of the amazing things about Jujitsu, is both guys and girls train it. And I was surprised. So, like I'm a big fan of yoga pants [giggles] at the gym kind of thing. It reveals the beauty of the female form. But the thing is, like girls are dressed in skintight clothes in Jujitsu often. And I found myself not at all, thinking like that at all when training with girls. - Well, the context is very non-sexual. - But I was surprised to learn that. When I first started to Jujitsu, I thought, wouldn't that be kind of weird to train with the opposites that in something so intimate. - So, boys and girls, men and women, they roll Jujitsu together? - Completely. - Interesting. - And the only times girls kind of try to stay away from guys, I mean, there's two contexts, of course, there's always going to be creeps in this world. So, everyone knows who kind of stay away from, and the other is there's a size disparity. So, girls will often try to roll with people a little bit closer weight-wise, But no, that's one of the things that are empowering to women, that's what they fall in love with when they started doing Jujitsu, is first of all, they gain an awareness and a pride over their body, which is great. And then second, they get to especially later on, start submitting big dudes like these bros that come in who are all shredded and like muscular, and they get to technique to exercise dominance over them, and that's a powerful feeling. - You've seen women force a larger guy to tap her, or even choke them up. - Well, I was deadlifting like a four, oh boy, I think it's 495. So, I was really into power-lifting when I started at Jujitsu, and I remember being submitted by, I thought I walked in feeling like I'm going to be, if not the greatest fighter ever, at least top three. And so, as a white belt, you roll in like all happy. And then you realize that as long as you're not applying too much force, that you're having, I remember being submitted many times by like 130, 120-pound girls at our Balance Studios in Philadelphia, that a lot of incredible female Jujitsu players. And that's really humbling too that technique can overpower in combat pure strength. And that's the other thing, there is something about combat that's primal. Like there, it just feels, it feels like we were born to do this. Like that- - We have circuits in our brain that are dedicated to this kind of interaction. There's no question. - And that's what it felt like, it wasn't that I'm learning a new skill. It was like, somehow I am a remembering echoes of something I've learned in the past. - Well, it's like hitting puberty. A child before puberty has no concept of boys and girls having this attraction, regardless of whether or not they're attracted to boys or girl, doesn't matter. At some point, most people, not all, but certainly, but most people, when they hit puberty, suddenly people appear differently, and certain people take on a romantic or sexual interest for the very first time. - Yeah. - And so it's like, it's revealing a circuitry in the brain. It's not like they learn that it's innate. And I think it, when I hear the way you describe Jujitsu and enrolling Jujitsu, it reminds me a little bit, Joe was telling me recently about the first time he went hunting and he felt like it revealed a circuit that was in him all along, but he hadn't experienced before. - Yeah. That's definitely there. And of course, there's the physical activity. One of the interesting things about Jujitsu is it's one of the really strenuous exercises that you can do late into your adult life, like into your 50, 60, 70s, 80s. When I came up, there's a few people in their 80s that were training. And as long as you're smart, as long as you practice techniques and pick your partners correctly, you can do that kind of art. That's late into life. And so you're getting exercise. There's not many activities I find that are amenable to that. So, because it's such a thinking game, the Jujitsu in particular is an art or technique pays off a lot. So you can still maintain, first of all, remain injury free if you use good technique, and also through good technique be able to go, be active with people that are much, much younger. And so that was, to me, that and running are the two activities you can kind of do late in life. Because to me a healthy life has exercises as the piece of the puzzle."}
{"question": "Can facial expressions directly influence our emotional states, or is it more complex and influenced by the entire sensory ensemble and context?", "doc_id": "FeRgqJVALMQ_3", "video_id": "FeRgqJVALMQ", "video_title": "Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: How to Understand Emotions | Huberman Lab Podcast", "video_header": "Facial Movement & Interpretation, Emotion", "segment_idx": "3", "time_start": "10:49", "time_end": "19:29", "context": "expressions and emotions because as you were explaining the core components of emotions I had to think back to the classic textbook images of the different faces associated with fear with delight with confusion on and on we we will get to that and your opinions on that scientifically in informed opinions of course but there is a bit of a myth that the emotion system and the facial expression system run in both directions for instance people will say if you smile it's harder to feel sad or anxious I can't say that's been my experience but I very well could be wrong so we know that when people's emotional states change their facial expressions often will change right if you see someone crying on the street um versus somebody smiling really big you we can make some assumptions about what might be going on at uh internally for them but put simply is it true that changing one's facial expression can direct shifts in the brain and body perhaps that change our emotional states if you'll permit me what I would say is that your question is ill posed so first of all it presumes that there's an emotion system and that there's a facial expression system now clearly there's a system for moving facial muscles okay but a movement is not the same as an expression a movement is a movement an expression is an interpretation of the meaning of a movement not all movements of the face are expressions um and this is a you know a problem it's a problem in science um in it's often the case uh I think in my experience in the science of emotion but elsewhere too that scientists in their efforts to make their work um meaningful to people will try to interpret their findings in in ways that uh the average person would um find interesting or the way that a physician would find interesting or a teacher or what have you to be able to use this information but then they forget that they're actually making an interpretation and they start to refer to their observations with the labels of interpretation so facial movements are facial movements people move their faces and that those movements have meaning but they're not always to express an internal state in fact one might think that they're very rarely to um Express an internal state so I don't know that there's a facial expression system either so that's there's certainly like I said um there there's circuitry for moving a face but um but what those movements mean um is highly VAR able and so that would be my second point that where I would say when you see someone crying on the street you are not looking only at their face you might be aware um that you're focusing on their face that might be the part of the entire sensory Ensemble that you are focusing your attention on but your brain is taking in an entire ensemble of signals as you know it's taking in not just the you know movements of the face the tears or whatever it's taking in all of the the entire sensory array The Sounds the smells what's going on inside your own body your brain is being um bombarded with signals from from all of those sources and when it's making an meaning out of any signal it's doing it in an ensemble of signals so research shows that baby's cries aren't acoustically specific to when they're tired or hungry or right um the you can I can show you a video without context and show you someone crying and um you might make a judgment you might think make the stereotypic judgment in the west oh that person is sad and then we pan out and really you know it's a little girl whose dad just came home from Iraq or something right so brains are always interpreting faces in context they're making guesses this is something that I've talked about quite a bit that we don't read movements in people we don't read emotions in facial expressions we make inferences about the emotional meaning of facial movements and we do it in an ensemble of other signals the the context uh as you if you will and that's really what's what's happening so um do I think that um that there is feedback from the face to the brain sure I mean there's feedback from every muscle but there's this constant conversation between the brain and the body um the brain is sending motor commands the body is you know has sensory surfaces which are sending signals back to the brain so if the face is influencing the brain it's doing so in a way that's not special it it's doing it in a way that that works for all other parts of your body too and I guess what I would say this kind of a long window did answer but over time your brain has learned that certain patterns of signal over time um recur and so if you're smiling if your brain is you know telling your your facial muscles to move in a particular way that looks like smiling um it's happening in a larger Ensemble of signals and then the brain is predicting what's going to happen next because it's learned over time what happens next so probabilistically so if you think about that as cause then sure but it's not as it's not this simplistic kind of idea that an emotion is triggered um uh it causes facial muscles to move in a particular way and therefore if you just pose your face in in those in that particular Arrangement it that will somehow feed back to the emotion system and change that system because there are no there is no emotion system in your brain and the the causation just isn't that it's not that simplistically mechanistic that makes sense to me I I uh frankly never bought the idea that just smiling would make me feel happy um especially if my internal state was not one of Happiness like fighting the internal State also so um in the early 2000s I think it was there was a lot of discussion about how positioning the body in certain ways you know taking up more space would allow people to feel more powerful and they some of these studies um and uh argued that there were even hormonal shifts associated with um taking up more space that were associated with feelings of empowerment and then when shrinking of oneself was associated with elevated cortisol States and as I say all this I'm I I want to be clear that um I do not take a simplistic view of the nervous system or endocrine system and I I didn't um I don't think that you were implying that either just want to make sure that anyone listening or watching isn't thinking that uh for instance that cortisol is bad cortisol is wonderful and essential you just need it regulated properly or that um the idea that the body and emotional states are are inextricably linked makes a ton of sense to me but the idea that you could just you know grab onto one of the nodes in the now I have to be careful not say emotion system um like position of the body like being hunched over makes you depressed no that never made sense to me taking up more space makes you feel more uh powerful that doesn't it it can't be that way and yet we were told for about a decade through especially through popular press that this stuff was true um and so what I love about your work is that it includes a neuroanatomical a psychological a network work perspective that that there isn't one seat of emotions and and so on um so if we could go a little bit further into the facial"}
{"question": "What are the key findings and advancements in the Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study, particularly in relation to the development and application of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in treating depression?", "doc_id": "X4QE6t-MkYE_27", "video_id": "X4QE6t-MkYE", "video_title": "Dr. Nolan Williams: Psychedelics & Neurostimulation for Brain Rewiring | Huberman Lab Podcast #93", "video_header": "Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) Study", "segment_idx": "27", "time_start": "2:28:44", "time_end": "2:34:24", "context": "Listen, Nolan, Dr. Williams, this has been an amazing voyage through the circuitry of autonomic control. This landscape of the prefrontal cortex is, I find incredibly fascinating and I just want to start off by saying please do come back again and teach us more about that and your TMS work. Before we wrap, however, I do want to give you the opportunity to talk about the SAINT study. - Yeah, definitely. - Is it SAINT or SAINTS plural? - Yeah, it's SAINT. So SAINT, or we're calling it SNT now. SAINT has, you know... The intent was not to kind of connect it to religion, but we may have accidentally done so. And so we abbreviated it to SNT for the subsequent trials, which was initially Stanford Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy, or now what we're calling Stanford Neuromodulation Therapy. But the idea there, which is a cool idea, is that TMS is a device that delivers a treatment, and the treatment is the protocol. And the protocol is the stimulation parameter set in a specific brain region for a specific condition. And so what's cool about neuromodulation, whether it be transcranial magnetic stimulation or transcranial direct current stimulation or deep brain stimulation, like what Casey Halpern talked about on another podcast, is this idea that in all of those cases, the device itself is a physical layer conduit of a stimulation protocol that's therapeutic for a given condition in a given brain region. And so in the case of depression, which we know the most about for with TMS, we've been doing TMS studies for depression for, you know, since 1995, right? And the clearance in 2000, 2008, 2009. And in that timeframe, we were able to go from really knowing very little at all about how to do something like this to getting an FDA clearance. And the way that it went down was that there were two groups studying different components at NIH. The first group was studying mood neuroanatomy on functional imaging. That was kind of the first generation of functional imaging back then, so PET scans, which are kind of metabolic scans, and then SPECT scans. And the idea there was looking at activity and metabolism and prefrontal cortex. And what they found in these kind of more crude scans is that just general hypoactivity, hypometabolism. The other group right upstairs at the National Institute for Neurological Diseases and Stroke, NINDS, they were looking at using TMS, which had been around for 10 years, and repetitively stimulating in motor cortex. And what they found was, gosh, we can get a readout in thumb muscle movement amplitude that's really reproducible across people. It's like, you know, universally reproducible. And if we do certain stimulation approaches, they are biologically active to either increase excitability, IE the thumb motion, and a set intensity goes up, the amount of amplitude goes up, or inhibitory or depotentiating, it goes down with other biological stimulation approaches. And then a third outcome, which is important, that it's inert, it doesn't do either. So you can have stimulation approaches that do one, you know, increase activity, decrease activity, or are inert. And so what they found was, oh, we can excite certain brain regions. Then my mentor, Mark George said, had this kind of aha moment where he said, \"Wow, there's underactivity in prefrontal cortex in depression, and we can increase activity using this thing that we know we can increase activity in motor cortex. We just need to put it in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.\" And then they combined the two and started stimulating once a day in this kind of very abbreviated fashion. And lo and behold, some of those depression patients resolved their depression. And back then, and still today, you can go and as a psychiatric patient stay at the National Institute of Mental Health and go through clinical trials to try to get treated. And there were patients who'd been there for months and they were able to be discharged. Because their mood was better, yeah. And so just very crude approach where they were using ruler measurements where DLPFC was, and they were stimulating with devices that you needed to physically dunk the coil in an ice bath. And with that, they still were able to, the kind of genius of this, Mark and others, they would still be able to create a purely engineered stimulation approach. What's cool about that is that they kind of found two things, right? They found this one stimulation protocol that does have some antidepressant effect. It's limited, it doesn't treat everybody, it does have some antidepressant effect. And this bigger concept that a neuromodulation device is kind of like a pharmaceutical company for you, right? That in a given individual, a TMS device or whatever neuromodulation device is able to generate, you can create a stimulation approach that is specific to a given condition and specific to an individual. And so the physical layer is just how you exert that, similarly to how we make pharmaceutical drugs in a pharmaceutical company. But the actual therapy itself is what you do, where you do it. And so what we learned from, you know, another 20, 30 years of this is that you can modify the stimulation protocol in such a way"}
{"question": "What are the key brain regions and cellular mechanisms that underlie social interaction and communication in individuals with autism?", "doc_id": "w9MXqXBZy9U_6", "video_id": "w9MXqXBZy9U", "video_title": "Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Understanding & Healing the Mind", "video_header": "What Would A Cure For the Broken Mind Look Like?", "segment_idx": "6", "time_start": "27:02", "time_end": "32:18", "context": "- So, what are the pieces that are going to be required to cure autism, cure Parkinson's, cure schizophrenia? I would imagine there are several elements and 'beens here', understanding the natural biology, understanding what the activity patterns are, how to modify those, maybe you could just tell us what you think, what is the Bento Box of the perfect cure? - I think the first thing we need is understanding. Almost every psychiatric treatment has been serendipitously identified, just noting by chance that something that was done for some person also had a side effect- - Like lithium or something- - Like lithium, is a good example. - Is it true that it was the urine of guinea pigs given lithium that was given to manic patients that made them not manic? Is that true? - I don't have firsthand knowledge of that, but I would defer that, but it's true for essentially every treatment, that the antidepressants originally arose as anti-tuberculosis drugs, for example. - I did not know that. - Yeah, and so this is a classic example for illnesses across all of psychiatry, and of course there's the seizures as well. That was noticed that patients who had epilepsy, they had a seizure there and also had depression, that they became much, at least for awhile, they were improved after that seizure. - That's amazing. I don't want to take you off course of the question answering the question I asked, but I've heard before that if autistic children get a fever, that their symptoms improve, is that true? - I've done a fair bit of work with autism. In my clinical practice, I work with adult autism and I have heard statements like that and descriptions like that from patients and their families. That is very hard to study quantitatively because often with the children, you have this not as quantitative as you'd like collection of symptom information from home. But I have heard that enough that I think there may well be something to that. And anytime you have a fever, what's going on? Well, we know all the cells in the brain, and I know this as an electrophysiologist, if you just change the temperature by a few degrees, everything changes about how neurons work and that's even just a single neuron. It's even more likely to be complex and different with a circuit of neurons that are all affecting each other. Just elevate the temperature a little bit, everything's different. And so, it's plausible for sure, that things like that could happen and do happen. And yet, when you think about autism, to take your example, yes, we see changes, but what is the elements of the brain that's analogous to the pumping heart? When we think about the symptoms of depression, we think about motivation and dopamine neurons. When we think about autism, it's a little more challenging. There's a deficit in social interaction and in communication. And so where is that? Where is that situated? What is the key principle governing the social interaction? This is where we need the basic science to bring us a step forward, so we can say okay, this is the process that's going on. This is what's needed for the incredibly complex task of social interaction, where you've got incredibly rich data streams of sound and meaning, eye contact, body movement, and that's just for one person. What if there's a group of people? This is overwhelming for people with autism. What's the unifying thing there? It's a lot of information, and that maybe is unmatched in any realm of biology, the amount of information coming in through a social interaction, particularly with words and language. And so then, that turns our attention as neuroscientists, we think, okay, let's think about the parts of the brain that are involved in dealing with merging complex data streams that are very high in bit rate that need to be fused together into a unitary concept. And that starts to guide us, and we know other animals are social in their own way, and we can study those animals. And so that's how I think about it. There's hope for the future, thinking about the symptoms as an engineer might, and trying to identify the circuits that are likely working to make this typical behavior happen, and that will help us understand how it becomes atypical. - So that seems like the first to me, the first been of this, what I call the Bento Box for lack of a better analogy, that we need to know the circuits. We need to know the cells in the various brain regions and end portions of the body and how they connect to one another, and what the patterns of activity are under a normal 'healthy interaction'. - Yeah. - If we understand that, then it seems that the next step, which of course could be carried out in parallel, right? Though that work can be done alongside work where various elements within those circuits are tweaked just right, like the tuning of a piano in the subtle way, or maybe even like the replacement of a whole set of keys if the piano is lacking keys, so to speak. - Right. - You've been very involved in trying to generate those tools."}
{"question": "What are some recently discovered ways to combat fear and trauma, and how do they work?", "doc_id": "31wjVhCcI5Y_0", "video_id": "31wjVhCcI5Y", "video_title": "Erasing Fears & Traumas Based on the Modern Neuroscience of Fear", "video_header": "Introducing Fear, Trauma & Trauma", "segment_idx": "0", "time_start": "0:00", "time_end": "2:13", "context": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. - I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, we're going to talk about the Neuroscience of fear. We are also going to talk about trauma and post-traumatic stress disorders. The Neuroscience of fear has a long history in biology and in the field of psychology. However, I think it's fair to say that in the last 10 years, the field of Neuroscience has shed light on not just the neural circuits, meaning the areas of the brain that control the fear response and the ways that it does it, but some important ways to extinguish fears using behavioral therapies, drug therapies, and what we call brain machine interfaces. Today, we are going to talk about all of those, and you're going to come away with both an understanding of the biology of fear and trauma, as well as many practical tools to confront fear and trauma. In fact, we are going to discuss one very recently published study in which five minutes a day of deliberate exposure to stress was shown to alleviate longstanding depressive and fear related symptoms. We will get into the details of that study and the protocol that emerges from that study a little later in the podcast. But it stands as a really important somewhat counter-intuitive example of how stress itself can be used to combat fear. To give you a sense of where we are going, I'll just lay out the framework for today's podcast. First, I'm going to teach you about the biology of fear and trauma. Literally the cells and circuits and connections in the body and chemicals in the body that give rise to the so-called fear response. And why sometimes, but not always fear can turn into trauma. I will also describe the biology of how fear is unlearned or what we call extinguished. And there too, you're going to get some serious surprises. You're going to learn for instance, that we can't just eliminate fears. We actually have to replace fears with a new positive event. And again, there are tools with which to do that, and I will teach you those tools today. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford."}
{"question": "What are the benefits and potential risks of cleanses and fasting for gut health, and how do they compare to a traditional Mediterranean-style diet?", "doc_id": "ouCWNRvPk20_10", "video_id": "ouCWNRvPk20", "video_title": "Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: How to Build, Maintain & Repair Gut Health | Huberman Lab Podcast #62", "video_header": "Fasting, Cleanses & Gut Health", "segment_idx": "10", "time_start": "42:08", "time_end": "51:15", "context": "One is this notion of cleanses, from either direction. People will consume things by mouth to try and cleanse their digestive tract. This there's a long history of this. I'm not recommending this. There's differing opinions on whether or not this is good or bad. And the other is fasting or time-restricted feeding. The reason I ask about time-restricted feeding, is my understanding is that after a prolonged period of fasting, there's some auto-absorption or digestion of one's own digestive tract, that then gets renewed. In other words, you're testing and stomach start eating its own lining to some extent in the absence of food. So what do we know about cleanses? Oh, and then I suppose there's cleanses from the other direction too, right? Which, less popular, but I've never run the statistics, but certainly exist out there. What's the idea about cleanses and fasting as it relates to the health or the dysbiosis of the microbiota? - Yeah, there hasn't been a lot of high quality science in this area, and so it's really hard to conclude whether these are good for health or bad for health. I think the fasting... We're in a really interesting situation in the industrialized world, because we have so many problems associated with our digestive tract, and that probably has to do with our highly processed diet and perhaps having a microbiota that's fairly perturbed as well. And so, whether doing things like this are good or bad, it's really hard to define, because we may be starting off in a fairly bad state anyway. There's so many diseases that we're dealing with, metabolic syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, that just put a massive portion of the population in a very different category than people that are thinking about how do I maintain health, how do I live a long life, from starting off in what we consider a fairly healthy state. And so things like fasting and a lot of other therapies that have been developed in the field, I think ketogenic diet may be in this category as well. There can be tremendous benefits in terms of their impact in the context of metabolic syndrome, and for people that are battling eating a continual bad diet or something like that. - And adherence. I think one of the one of the reasons for the popularity of intermittent fasting, time-restricted feeding, and what do they call them now? Exclusion diets, where you entire entirely exclude meat, or you entirely exclude plants or whatever it is, is that adherence is sometimes easier in the all or none. As neurobiologists, we think of it as a go, no-go circuitry. It's harder to make decisions, nuanced decisions often, about food than it is to just eliminate entire categories of food. Not eating, for many people- - Yeah. - Is easier than eating smaller portions. - Yeah, yeah. Yeah, and- - Yeah. So some of it, I think, is neurobiological and psychological. - Absolutely. And we've had gastroenterology fellows in our lab that come in and we kind of... I think that to kind of slice through the nuance of all this, there's a very simple recipe and a really well accepted, broad definition of what a healthy diet is. kind of the Mediterranean diet, plant-based diet is... There's just a ton of data that particularly people of European ancestry, but there's a pretty broad acceptance that if you eat mostly plants, for most people, that's going to be very healthy, to the point where... A wonderful colleague of ours, Christopher Gardner, who's studied diet his whole life, trying to establish what a healthy diet is. And people was giving advice, I saw him giving advice to a dietician who is trying to get all the rules of what she should be recommending to people that she deals with that are interested in a healthy diet. And she said, so the number one, I'm going to say, plant-based fiber is probably super important, and that should be very high on the list. And she goes on to number two and he said, stop. He said, if people do number one well, you don't need to know any other rules. I mean, it's basically like if you can have a high fiber, plant-based diet, for most people, at least, talking about the bucket of people that are already in a healthy state, you don't really need to think about other things, because you can't eat too much meat, you can't eat too many sweets. You've already eaten a huge amount of plant-based fiber. Your gut is full, you're not going to be hungry. And it kind of takes care of worrying about what should I eat or what, what shouldn't I eat. Just eat a ton of whole grains, legumes, vegetables, fruit that's high fiber based, not high sugar. - Does it completely exclude meat, and fish and dairy? - And he was saying people can add their own spins on this. But I think that the main rule is just start off with... And it kind of gets back to, to Michael Pollan's mantra, eat food, not too much, mostly plants. I think if you stick with these simple rules, and don't overthink, like, should I have this? Can I eat eggs? Can I eat... Just kind of stick to these simple rules, it makes it very approachable. But I agree, so these gastroenterology fellows that we've had in our lab say that they... It's really hard. We kind of say to them, why won't you give this dietary advice that's really well-known. And they just said, well, it's, it's really hard to get people to change their diet, unless you're doing either a go, no-go sort of thing, or eliminating something. So if carrots are giving you problems, don't eat carrots. And that's a very simple, easy instruction to follow, but doesn't really deal with the root problem of why can't you eat carrots, because you should be able to eat carrots. Most people can eat carrots. And so I think that we... Yeah, when we're thinking about things like fasting, and all these different dietary regimes and cleanses that people do, we have to step back for a moment and say, okay, well, what are really the big, high level rules that we should take home? And then if you are experiencing problems, and you want to think about how to deal with them, it's good to go to an evidence-based method where there's actually data to back it up. The data in the field really shows that with like fasting, particularly if you go to animals that hibernate, or things like that, where there's really extended fasts, you actually have a microbiota come up that blooms in the absence of food coming in through diet that's really good at eating mucus. So you have bacteria that's that specialize in eating nutrients derived from the host, because there's no other nutrients to live on. Now, whether this is good or bad, we don't know. But it seems like the consumption of mucus in excess is a problem from the standpoint of microbes getting too close to host tissue and inciting inflammation, which is what we see in animal models when we deprive of dietary fiber. We see these mucus utilizers become abundant, and inflammatory markers start to come on. So fasting short term might be fine, probably. There's definitely benefits that are seen metabolically. In terms of what it means for long term health from the standpoint of the gut microbiota, I would say we don't have the answer to that yet. In terms of the cleanses and the flushes and all this, personally, I think it's a terrible idea. I mean, we know that if... In studies that are being done now to reprogram the gut microbiota to install a completely new microbial community, the first step is to wash away the resident microbial community that's there. So if you're in the process of acquiring a really good microbiota and you know how to do that, then flushing everything out is great. Otherwise, what is happening is you're kind of leaving rebuilding of the community to chance, like what is it? And so what microbes are going to colonize? Who's going to take up space after you do this flush or cleanse? And I think it's a little bit like playing Russian Roulette. You may end up with a good microbial community in there afterwards, you may not. You certainly want to pay close attention to what you're eating while you're doing the reconstitution of the community after you do something like that. - Yeah. Thank you for that. I know a lot of people are interested in these kinds of elimination diets. And intermittent fasting/ time-restricted feeding seems to be getting some traction, in part, because at some level we are all doing this when we sleep. Most of us aren't eating while we sleep anyway, and adjusting the numbers seems more accessible for a lot of people. We have a lot of colleagues at Stanford who I know happen to of that regimen, or a time-restricted feeding regimen, but also who follow the more traditional meal spacing as well, of course. One of the things that I wonder about as we talk about primarily plant-based with some,"}
{"question": "Can the use of certain medications, such as benzodiazepines or antidepressants, enhance or inhibit the effectiveness of hypnosis?", "doc_id": "PctD-ki8dCc_18", "video_id": "PctD-ki8dCc", "video_title": "Dr. David Spiegel: Using Hypnosis to Enhance Health & Performance", "video_header": "Drug Therapies & Hypnosis", "segment_idx": "18", "time_start": "1:40:10", "time_end": "1:42:34", "context": "with drug therapies inside of the hypnotic episode? So, I realize that some patients of yours, might be prescribed a antidepressant or a medication for some purpose, maybe same or different than the hypnosis is being directed toward. But is there any evidence that, if people are relaxed through the use of a propranolol or one of these many things in the psychiatrist's kit, that hypnosis can be more effective? - Well, interestingly, one study that I haven't mentioned is, we did spectroscopy on people who were hypnotized. And we found that, there was a correlation between hypnotizability and GABA activity in the anterior cingulate cortex, which fits with turning down activity. To the extent that we can self-medicate and GABA receptors basically are doing what benzodiazepines do to the brain, that can happen when people are hypnotized. - So you're saying inside of the hypnosis, you have neural evidence that, there's a kind of a sedative effect of hypnosis at the chemical level. - Yeah, right. - Amazing. - The people who are more hypnotizable, have more of those GABA receptives and it's related to the degree of their hypnotizability. - Fascinating. - In terms of, there have been studies, where they give people medications as well. And the interesting thing with benzodiazepines, which activate inhibitory activity in the brain. If you are very anxious, it might improve your hypnotic response a bit. If you're just so anxious and you can't do it. If you're not very anxious, it actually inhibits hypnotic activity because you get sort of sedated and just out of it. And you can't focus your attention, as well. So, by and large, we don't use drugs as an adjuvant to hypnotic experience. Most of the time you don't need to. And sometimes it can make it worse rather than better. There's some evidence that, mild stimulants might enhance hypnotic responsiveness, a little reliably, but too much, Well, scatter attention and you'll have less control over it. So, they might be adjuvants, but I frankly think hypnosis is more of a replacement than a need of supplementation. - Your laboratory and my laboratory have, well, have sort of snuck into your lab and then trying to emerge the two, it's been a lot of fun, - It sure has, been learning a lot about,"}

are experiencing and they'll create or move towards all sorts of um emotional gymnastics in order to work with that years ago I saw I think it was a YouTube video with Jim Carrey who basically revealed that he became funny as a way to make his sick mom laugh that he grew up with a very sick mom which is chronically ill and so he would like throw himself down the stairs and try and make her laugh or do you know he was an incredible like world class physical comic um among other aspects of of Comedy but that his whole career was born out of this childhood tendency to notice that his mom was really hurting and try and basically make her laugh make her feel something good and it you know now I'm thinking about this because it's just incredible the way that kids can pick up on something and then and try and find a solution to it yeah you know I could imagine that for kids who have a sick parent could be a mental um challenges or physical challenges that they've got to notice yes and um in the case of Jim Carrey one could argue whether or not it was adaptive or not adaptive he had this you know meteoric career but um eventually just left it decided that wasn't what what he wanted to do um but leaving that extreme example aside let's say a parent is sick with the flu or is grieving the loss of you know God forbid a spouse or um or or something really major yeah uh at what point does the parent need to say listen I'm really hurting this is bad and I can handle it when that might not actually be true so the question is you know uh how how much information to give kids yeah because you don't want to lie to them on the other hand you don't want them to feel the burden of of needing to worry about a circumstance and I'm framing this in the context of sick parent but I'm also raising this thing of um Financial worries a close friend um who told me that growing up their parent was like constantly dealing with you know moving from one job to the next it was like this issue of whether or not we're going to have enough resources to get through the next year was a constant question and this person is now in their mid-30s and you you can tell it still haunts them and it's completely shaped their relationship to work and finances yeah yeah I mean I think we can we can think about this compared to what would I want from my boss I have a boss who's I don't know going through a really hard time or having a really hard time at home and I kind of notice it I'd probably want my boss to level with me and say kind of again you're right to notice I'm going through a hard time but at what point would it feel like o am I safe in this organization right I I I I think we probably all have a point there and I think it's the same thing with kids kids really do need to feel like they have sturdy parents again I always go back to Pilots because I think airplane examples are so powerful because there's very few times in adulthood that we actually feel like our safety is truly dependent on another adult like 100% when you're a passenger in an airplane you are 100% dependent so it's kind of the closest Dynamic and you can imagine what it would be like if the was saying going through a really hard time who wants to come in and give me you know I don't know you know tell me a nice story like oh my goodness like I okay you're going through a hard time but this is really not feeling great right um and what that means and which is you know kind of even a larger point is if you're a pilot you need to make sure you're really doing a lot of self-care more than the average person because of this outsized responsibility you have this is what I think about parenting and it's why from you know bigger theme Here is this is what gets me out of bed you know every morning so motivated is not just to help parents understand Tantrums or emotions or you know the latest struggle in their house although I actually love that it's to say hold on like we've been really sold like an awful story about what it really means to be a parent and how parenting really first and foremost is a journey of self-care how can I be the sturdiest person possible who do I need in my life when things go poorly so so I don't lean on my young children and give them a responsibility that is not theirs you know I I was just saying to someone the other day that when you have kids all of the unhealed parts of your childhood come right before your eyes they are just triggered over and over and over with your own children like you know oh my kid's whining I can't deal with that oh well whining is probably trickling because it's kind of Representative of helplessness what was it like in my family if I kind of felt helpless was that allowed did I grow up in a you know if you don't stop crying I'll give you something to cry about family okay if I don't resolve that I'm going to act that all out on my children and pass that along so all of kind of these situations where parents are feeling all these different emotions from a trigger from something in their life I I think it goes to what I always tell parents you know you have a first and foremost job of self-care and taking care of yourself that doesn't mean traveling to Europe for the year and leaving your kids alone it means what is going on inside you what skills do you need what networks of support do you need what do you have around you to help you on the hardest journey of your life and the most rewarding one of being a parent so that you don't have to say to your kids you know oh you know can you kind of take care of me Paul kti who came on this podcast to do a a series about mental health not just mental challenges but also mental health which is an interesting Concept in its own right um has been quoted as saying that you know that if you were to list out the hundred most important things for romantic relationships it would be self-care and communication repeated 50 times and I'm thinking about that now because sounds like a pretty good model for pretty much every relationship yes self-care communication and I must say the first time I heard him say that it wasn't on uh my podcast it was on a different podcast sort of surprised I thought self-care first but the way you're framing it um seems to me that if self-care comes first or at least very high on the list of what parents should do it frees up the kids to live and experience life with a lot more ease yeah lot more a lot more peace yeah and to basically unburden them of about 50,000 jobs that's exactly right and I think self-care has has gotten you know misrepresented it doesn't mean getting a manicure every week it could if that does it for you but when I think about self-care and I really think about the work we do with parents at good inside we always say good inside and like our app it's not parenting it's for parents it's for the Journey of what it means to be a parent it's for your own stuff it's for your triggers it's for finally learning how to set boundaries it's about finally learning that it's okay to get your needs met even when they inconvenience others it's learning that your Rel relationships are strong enough that they can get through hard moments where people are upset with you right it's about finally saying to if you need to your mother-in-law we can't have any visitors on Saturday and the reason I'm finally able to do that is because I understand my self value and all this stuff this has nothing to do with the fact that your kid isn't sleeping at night but that is the foundation for intervening in the way you're proud of when your kid is waking you up at 2 in the morning right so that is the self-care it's really like a not just self-care it's self- establishment it's self-growth really I don't know the psychology"}

by the way thank you for taking me that was such an incredible experience it was really fun it was really fun it reminded me of early punk rock shows where like some of my first punk rock shows where I went and just was like oh my gosh this is exciting and scary and I love it yeah and it felt loving too yes which is also the community of punk rock that I observed and have been blessed to be a part of it's like I it's like there yeah there's aggression but there's also love and then there's romance and then there's also um betrayal and there's all the elements but there's still a sense of like everyone wants to be here and there's a sense of goodness behind at all even though some of it was bloody and violent yes so for you what what does wrestling allow you to feel in those high intensity environments it completely relaxes me because there are no Stakes you know nobody everyone's working together in the show to protect each other no one's trying to hurt anybody regardless of what the story line is it's like a ballet where there's a fight in the ballet there's no um there's no actual aggression of people towards each other it's just the opposite but you get to experience this wildly Dynamic exciting surreal theater piece uh where people are doing these uh gymnastic and acrobatic things that are truly death defying um and it's fun and the the storylines absorb you in a way where you know you never know what's true and what's not Mo you know we know wrestling's fake we're told wrestling's fake but there's something um legitimate about it that seems to me more legitimate than anything else the most legitimate because it's the closest to what the world's actually like people don't always tell you what they really think and when someone tells you a story it might not really be the true story they may even think they may be they may think they're telling you the real story and that might not be the real story we don't know we know so little you know we we we experience something and then we make up a story to understand it ourselves and then forever more when we tell that story it was our version of a of an experience but we don't know that's what happened that was our take on it um wrestling is like that's what the real world is like because we when you watch wrestling you never know what's true that's what if you watch the news like you watch wrestling and you never know what's true it's more it would be more accurate you you'd have a better sense of the world if you took it all in like it was pro wrestling I think we're in a place in human history where people are starting to feel that way about the media it's also why wrestling so popular you know it's it's uh more popular than it's ever been yeah that's interesting things like UFC kind of gladiator like octagon fights and wrestling are increasing in popularity despite the fact that supposedly we're evolving so I think it reflects something both primitive and evolved about the human brain yes right primitive in the sense that yeah there's some violence it's physical that's down in the hypothalamus as we'd say no it scratches that itch MH but they're actually protecting each other you know it scratches that itch of seeing the Gladiators but it's like watching a movie you know it's not they're not really it's they're not really hurting each other they get hurt but only because the things they're doing are so crazy I think in order to be able to thoroughly enjoy wrestling one has to be able to give up narrative distancing just a little bit right narrative distancing is this sense that this is a story it's a movie it's not real but there were moments like yesterday the the jump off the top rope onto the guy who SPL out on the ladder the ladder breaks this was right in front of us it couldn't have felt good no he walked away he seemed fine yeah uh is but that and then um there was a match between two women where a woman put a metal plate into her uh into the bottoms of her suit and then ran in then jumped onto the other woman and you know hit her with the metal plate and then the metal plate kind of slipped out and she was walking around and everyone knew she had cheated cuz you're not supposed to use the metal plate but so it was sort of exciting cuz she had done it exciting cuz she had gotten away with it and at the same time exciting and upsetting that the referee saw it but then didn't call it this is like Twitter X this is like Instagram this is like politics this is like this is real life right like seeing people get away with things is so frustrating if you feel they shouldn't have yeah that's all part of it it's like a it's a very uh accurate representation of the world love it I'm I'm it's it's weird because I never would have thought I'd be hooked I'm hooked it's like archery and professional wrestling now it's like I'm going to be busy guy in 24 I'm going to come back to this very practical question and ask a different question first there are a few comments in here that are just Priceless by the way someone wanted to point out that you're a Pisces and so is Einstein a couple of historical questions I know you're not big on answering historical questions um necessarily maybe you are but I can't help every time I see you asking a question about the Ramones or asking a question about Joe Strummer but I I like this question first of all it starts off I love Rick Rubin he's so fascinating there's so many questions that start that way on the podast that you did with Joe Rogan uh you talked about your experience with Johnny Cash and seeing him in a new light after doing interviews for a book about Johnny or something like that um the question this person asked was from your present view what was the most impactful moment or moments from being with him and working with him or simply do you recall a moment working with Johnny Cash that you particularly enjoyed uh I enjoyed anytime I got to spend time with him he was a really Soulful serious shy quiet man incredibly knowledgeable he knew a great deal about history and had so much about music he knew every song he didn't he may not have known modern songs but he knew the history of Music um really well and there was just a a humble honesty about him that came through I think that the strength of him as an artist was when he said words even if he didn't write the words if he told a story in words you believe that story so he had a a credible gravitas and um he was great because of who he was it wasn't his ability as a singer it wasn't his ability as a songwriter although he was a great great songwriter and he was a great singer but that's not why he was Johnny Cash He was Johnny Cash because of the human being underneath and anything that that guy would have done we would be interested in because that's how much of a beam of light he was on the planet it just happened to be music just happened to be music I love that

Animal Experimentation, Pigs", "segment_idx": "15", "time_start": "1:22:14", "time_end": "1:33:09", "context": "let's talk about pigs sure neural link has been um quite generous I would say in announcing their discoveries and their goals and I I want to highlight this because I think it's quite unusual for a company to do this um I'm probably going to earn a few enemies by saying this um despite the fact that I've always owned Apple devices and from the South Bay um you know the apple design team is notoriously cryptic about what they're going to do next or when the next phone or computer is going to come out is is is vaulted to um a serious extent neural link has been pretty open about their goals right with the understanding the goals change and have to change and one of the things that they've done which I think is marvelous is they've held online symposia where you and some other colleagues of mine from the Neuroscience committee Dan Adams who have tremendous respect for and Elon and others their neural link have shared some of the progress that they've made in experimental animals I'm highlighting this because I think if one takes a step back I mean just for most people to know about and realize that there's experimentation on animals implantation of electrodes and so on is itself a pretty bold move because that understandably evokes some strong emotions um in people and in some people evokes extremely strong emotions sure um neural link did one such Symposium where they showed implant devices in pigs right then they did another one you guys did another one where it was implant devices in monkeys right I assume at some point there will be one of these public symposia where um the implant devices will be in a human what was the rationale for using pigs I'm told pigs are very nice creatures yeah I'm told that they are quite smart right um and for all my years as a neuroscientist and having worked admittedly on every species from mice to cuttlefish to humans to hamsters to uh you know I confess um various carnivore species which I no longer do I work on humans now for various reasons I never in my life thought I would see a implant device in the cortex of a pig sure why work on pigs yeah well let me let me say first neurolink is almost entirely composed of animal loving people the people at norlink are obsessive animal lovers there are signs up all around the office you know spontaneously put up by people within the organization you know talking about how we want to save animals we want to protect animals if there was any possible way to help people the way we want to help people without using animals in our research we would do it it's just not known how to do that right now and so we are completely restricted to making advances to getting a device approval through the FDA by first showing that it's incredibly safe in animals and so as is the case for any medical advancement essentially exactly I do want to highlight this that the the FDA and the other governing bodies um oversee these types of experiments and ensure that they're done with a minimum of discomfort to the animals of course but um I think there's an inherent speciesism right in uh in most humans not all some people truly see equivalence between a lizard and a human lizard life being equivalent to human life most human beings I think in particular human beings who themselves or have loved ones that are suffering from diseases that they hope could be cured at some point view themselves as species and feel that if you have to work on a biological system in order to solve the problem um working on non-human animals first makes sense right to most people sure but certainly there's a category of people that feels very strongly in the opposite direction sure and you know I think we would probably be having a very different conversation around animal research if uh we weren't you know we as a species we as a culture weren't just casually slaughtering millions of animals to eat them um every single day and so that is a background against which that the relatively minuscule number of animals used in research it becomes almost impossible to understand why someone would point to that ridiculously small number of animals used in research when the vast vast majority of animals that humans use and end their lives are are done for food or for fur or for fur or these other reasons that people you know have historically used animals so we in in that context we do animal research because we have to there's no other way around it if tomorrow uh laws were changed and the FDA said okay you can do some of this early experimentation in willing human participants that would be a very interesting option I think there would be a lot of people that would step up and say yes I'm willing to participate in early stage clinical research you already volunteered uh yeah um and I wouldn't be alone and that you know is a potential way that animals could maybe be spared uh being unwilling participants in this on that note to whatever extent possible I think neuralink goes um really really far much much farther than anyone I've ever heard of any organization I've ever heard of any anything I've ever seen to give the animals agency in every aspect of the research we have just an incredible team of people looking out for the animals and trying to design the experiments such that they're as purely opt-in as humanly possible no animal is ever compelled to participate in experiments beyond the surgery itself so if say on a given day our our star monkey pager doesn't want to play video games for Smoothie no one forces them to ever this is a very important point and I want to cue people to really what Matt is saying here um obviously the animals are being researched on for neural links so they don't get to opt in to opt out of the experiment right um but what he's saying is that they play these games during which neural signals are measured from the brain because they have electrodes implanted in their brain through a surgery that thankfully to the brain is painless right no pain receptors in the brain um and are playing for reward this is very different very different than the typical scenario in Laboratories around the world where people experiment on mice monkeys some kisses pigs or other species in which the typical Arrangement is to water deprive the animals we never do that and then have the animals work for their daily ration of water right and some people are hearing this and probably think wow that's barbaric and here I'm not trying to point fingers at the people doing that kind of work I just think it's important that people understand how the work is done right in order to motivate an animal to play a video game right depriving them of something that they yearn for is a very efficient way to do that we don't do that we they have free and full access to food this entire time so they aren't hungry they aren't thirsty the only thing that would motivate them is if they want a treat extra to their normal rations but there's there's never any deprivation there's never any adverse negative stimuli that pushes them to do anything I must say I'm impressed by that decision um because uh training animals to do tasks in laboratory settings is very hard and the reason so many researchers have defaulted to water deprivation and and having animals work for a ration of water is because frankly it works right it allows people to finish their PHD or their postdoc more quickly than having to wait around um and try and figure out why uh their monkey isn't working that day in fact having known a number of people who've done these kinds of experiments although we've never done them in my lab my monkey isn't working today is a common uh gripe among graduate students and postdocs who do this kind of work um and for people who work on mice okay so this is um uh very important information to get across and there's no Public Relation statement uh woven into this is just we're talking about the nature of the research but I think it is important that people are aware of this yeah it's one of the one of the underappreciated Innovations out of neurolink is how far the Animal Care team has been able to to move in the direction of Humane treatment of these guys wonderful as an animal lover myself I can only say wonderful why pigs yeah pigs are you know they're actually fairly commonly used in medical device research um more you know in the cardiac area their hearts are you know somewhat similar to human hearts how big are these pigs I've seen Little Pigs and I've seen big pigs yeah there's a range there's a bunch of different varieties of pig there's a bunch of different species that um you know you can optimize for different uh characteristics there's mini pigs there's um you know Yorkshires there's uh a lot of different kind of pigs that we use in different contexts when we're trying to optimize a certain characteristic so yeah the pigs are we don't necessarily need them to be smart or task performers although occasionally we have you know trained them to walk on a treadmill when we're studying how their limbs move for some of our spinal cord research um but we're not you know recording interesting say cognitive data out of their minds they're really just a biological platform with a skull that's close enough in size and shape to humans to be a valid platform to study the safety of the device unlike a monkey or a human a pig I don't think can reach out and hit a button or a lever exactly how are they signaling that they um saw or um sent to something yeah so again the pigs are really just a safety platform to say the device is safe to implant it doesn't you know break down or cause any kind of toxic reaction the monkeys are where we are really doing our heavy lifting in terms of ensuring that we're getting good signals out of the device that that what we expect to see in humans is validated on a functional level in in monkeys first"}

{"question": "What is the ideal amount of water I should be drinking daily, and how does my body weight, urine color, and nighttime urination relate to my hydration levels?", "doc_id":

Night Urination", "segment_idx": "3", "time_start": "20:37", "time_end": "35:33", "context": "eyes or wonder why are we even talking about that now but that I have to believe is among the more fundamental if not foundational aspects of nutrition and supplementation for performance and that's hydration right I mean I think we hear hydration it's like okay we have to drink 68 glasses of water every day our urine should be relatively clear if it's too dark yellow we're not doing a good job of hydrating enough yeah how much of that is true um is alkaline water worthwhile for changing the alkalinity of my body I learned when I was in college and graduate school that the alkalinity of the different tissues in your body is very well controlled in order to keep you alive and that you don't want it to shift too much or you can enter pretty horrible states of seizure vomiting and even death so tell me about hydration and woven into that if you would educate me on electrolytes and hydration because I think most often when people ingest electrolytes sure they could be ingesting salt tablets probably getting some electrolytes by the way electrolytes sodium magnesium potassium through their food I think most people think about drinking electrolytes so water and electrolytes I think is a vitally important topic to kick this off with sure we can jump right into your alkaline water um while there's perhaps much to say about this uh we can maybe revisit this in another seven part series all on its own uh I would just say it this way there's probably a few things you should do before worrying about the alkalinity of your water and I'll I'll just leave it at that meaning the alkaline of the water is sort of irrelevant not that you won't go that far it's just it's probably remember we sort of started off talking about 8020 M um well this would be in my like 991 in terms terms of like if we're really at the level of worrying about the pH of their your drinking fluid uh we have optimized so many other things uh that then we can talk about it but until we have nailed months and years of work on other things this is just not going to make much of an impact great then perhaps you could tell us about what volume of water we should be drinking when we should be drinking that water relative to training and just generally and um yeah and anything else related to water and electrolytes that can improve mental Performance Physical performance and offset any you know ill effects I like the fact that you mentioned physical and mental performance because it's clear in both cases we hear that we need to drink more water and I can give you some numbers and I will in a second what we also need to recognize is there's this is hormesis we talked about hormesis a few episodes ago and this is the case right whether we talked about food or hydration or I think I gave you the example of cyanide naturally occurring in your food hot water is same way so if you are under hydrated or dehydrated then there is a clear negative effect on your body and as I increase the level or improve the level of hydration things get better whether this are physical performance or whether this is mental performance in fact we know that a body weight reduction of as low as 2% via dehydration so imagine you're doing a about of exercise and you're sweating and you lose 2% of your body weight that alone is enough to reduce accuracy in performance so the classic study we talk about here was in basketball players so shooting accuracy so free throw shooting I think is specifically what they looked at um significant reduction in performance with as little as 2% dehydration that that level you also see a significant increase in perception of difficulty of exercise and so only right at 2% again when I say 2% I mean percent body weight lost right that's what that means you start getting the 3 four 5% dehydration you start having a significant reduction in blood volume and that's incredibly important for endurance um your blood becomes viscous it gets hard to pump through um and you're going to start having all kinds of issues so being dehydrated is again not only going to reduce performance but because of the mental aspect which we just walked through and neuromuscular issue you're going to lose accuracy you're going to lose total endurance performance and you're going to lose speed and power so we have the Triad there no matter what you're interested in it's going to be harmed by being dehydrated that also is happening then if you're starting your program dehydrated so um if you're already 1% or so DEH hydrated maybe you're like a little under hydrated and you lose a little bit of sweat you've already hit that 2% and so we're starting to see reductions um in performance there the same happens on the other side of that hormetic curve so if you are optimally hydrated in some large window but you start going past that we can start running into equal problems remember there is a there is a need for an optimal concentration of sodium and potassium and chloride between your cell inside your cell and outside your cell these are electrolytes this is what we call osmolality and osmol ity is is really think of it like concentration and osmosis if you remember those terms so if we are trying to create a muscle contraction that requires an electrical gradient and so sodium and potassium specifically in magnesium calcium are positively charged and chloride is negatively charged and we need to have a certain amount inside the cell and outside the cell so that the positives and the negatives are balanced appropriately um so that when we move one we change the voltage and we have in the case of a muscle contraction okay I just skimmed through a whole lot of of physiology there to say if you then go mess with fluid only and you say if I were to give you a bis of you know 3 l of pure water right now you're going to dilute your blood and so there's not going to be as many chemical uh there won't be as many electrical signals in there because you've taken the same amount of sodium potassium Etc and put it in a larger volume of pure water so that gradient is now changed that becomes a significant problem for contraction um I mean quite literally it can kill you this is what we call hyponatremia so nmia spelled na hypo being low hyponatremia if you actually go to the Periodic Chart na is what we Ed for sodium so hyper because the word is nrii actually so that what that literally means is low sodium and you didn't get that from sweating out all your sodium you actually get hyponatremia from drinking in too much water so it's not that the total amount of sodium gets low it's the fact that the concentration gets low from excessive fluid intake so in the Extremes in fact if you look at the the literature you'll see um anywhere between like 2 to 15% of people who finish endurance races are are into hyponatremia now that varies wildly if you're doing Iron Man and Kona versus like you know the marathon in Denver in in October right it's it's going to be totally different depending on weather conditions but these are all important um so while like death happens that is sort of extreme if you back up just a little bit you start seeing the same types of performance sacrements in fact the symptoms can be identical brain fog confusion performance uh irritation a GI distress and you think man these are symptoms of dehydration so then you drink more water and you're just exacerbating the problem and I can actually um give you one little example of this we had an executive actually female CEO uh I'll say she's probably when her was in her early 40s and so she came to us and she thought man for sure she has some sort of gut problem going on because we hear a lot about kind of like gut health and how it affects everything and so she's just like I have brain fog and I've done all these things and I got blood work done and everything's fine like nothing's going on I think I must have some sort of gut thinger going on whatever and it's okay and we just started going through her stuff and uh she was I think about 170 lbs plus or minus and she was consuming like 250 to 60 ounces of water a day that's a lot of water that's a ton of water and we were like holy what are you doing this for and she just like I that's sort of like my thing it was but she didn't realize it was more of like a nervous tick than it was anything else right she just like sip sip sip sip sip water I'm like man how often do you go pee she's like yeah like every you know 30 minutes or something I'm like fantastic sleep problems focus and so she's smashing caffeine she was at like 8 cups of coffee a day which is also going to add to to excretion of sodium totally right so it's like okay we don't really need to come in and run a sleep study on you we're just going to lower your water and she was like what we dropped her down to like 180 so basically an ounce per pound of body weight which is still high cuz she did train 180 ounces correct yeah she does work out so she needed to replenish some stuff and we'll cover these numbers in a second instantaneously I mean like two days in she's like oh my God I haven't slept six or eight hours in years and then after that it was like basically tears coming back to us right my focus my brain fog is gone CU she's in a very high pressure job um it's like everything's coming back like now she was down to three or so cups of coffee a day blah blah blah like the whole thing digestion improved all of it she was s like her only problem after all the analyses was she was just drinking way way too much water and adding more salt to her would not have solved the problem because she would have just had simply way too much fluid n system she was having all kinds of ADH problems and aldosterone like the whole thing and that that rolls into cortisol the whole like system gets goes into chaos so um it is important that you pay attention to hydration um even though as you sort of mentioned people tend to just kind of like roll their eyes around it because if you're in the middle it's fine but if you're anywhere past not even the extreme extremes but just that first standard deviation away um you're going to have problems and you might be thinking adrenal fatigue you might be thinking your Testo like you're going to think all these things and you simply just haven't actually dialed in your hydration yeah um I think people sometimes roll their eyes at the discussion of hydration because it just doesn't sound very sexy it's not like doesn't sound like a neurotransmitter or a hormone it sound like testosterone or estrogen or DHEA or um dopamine but it actually is all of those things it sits at a level beneath all of those but not beneath on a hierarchy beneath in in terms of a foundation it's actually the without proper electrolyte balance and hydration none of the cells of the body can function and then I think people also hear that oh you know we are 70% water and somehow like that statistic Alone um or that fact alone doesn't seem to uh stimulate any kind of action will take away it's like great you know uh like gravity also you know keeps us you know from jumping as high as we like you know what do I do and so I think um it's it's important that people understand that every cellular process in the body critically relies on having enough sodium magnesium pottassium around and the the way that it's concentrated in fluid water is really the way that you allow every cell in your body to function as well as it possibly could and respond to all the sorts of kind of quote unquote High Performance Tools that we're talking about the other thing I've observed many times over is that if people are ingesting too much water and also drinking a lot of caffeine and their electrolytes are low they get shaky and they actually can have anxiety like symptoms when people come into my lab to do studies on anxiety and fear we ask a few questions and um those questions include how much water they've had that day also a sort of bizarre fact um but one that I think is worth mentioning is that when the bladder is full it stimulates a sort of anxiety if you ever had to urinate very badly and you're in the car or you can't urinate and then you get the door like that's talk about anxiety um and that's because there's a direct neural pathway from the bladder that registers the mechanos sensors how much stretch there is on the bladder that sends a signal to the brain stem alertness areas broadly speaking Locus culus and others um that wake us up these are the when we're awake it makes us more awake and when we're asleep this is what wakes us up to urinate in the middle of the night yeah that's actually why you can use uh night urination as a a pretty good diagnostic of sleep disorders so if because of vasopressin right exactly what you're talking about uh if you're having sleep disorder issues and you're staying awake and uh vas op pressant gets taken off right an APN goes straight to the kidneys your kidneys are supposed to be dormant basically at night you're not supposed to be filtering a lot of and producing a lot of urine at night um if that's happening and and say you you have any number of apne kicking on or anything going on vasal press keeps going keeps sending signal kidneys start filtering so if you're waking up and peeing multiple times a night that's called nocta that is a very very very good sign that either one of two things happen you one you have some sort of sleep disorder or two you're drinking outrageous amounts of water and so that's actually a bit of a backwards cycle in now right because you're drinking way too much water you're waking up and peeing all night that's actually ruining your sleep and so we have seen this a number of times with our sleep company as we go in and it's just like you don't need any of this crap you just need to be properly hydrated alternatively if your hydration is sound and you're still waking up more than one time a night to pee on average then you almost well I shouldn't say like that but there's a potential that you have some sort of sleep disort or sleep condition going in so the rule of thumb on that is so we're here once or night once a night or so of urination is fine um if it is routinely or consistently more than two uh you need to make some adjustments start with hydration it's the simplest way right getting a full sleep study done just figure out hydration we we've had this happen a number of times where people want to get more health conscious and they just get they hear things like this and they're like I got to get on my water and then they just start train wrecking their sleep and they're waking it up so if you're w up multiple times and you're urinating and it is a large amount of urine for you and it is clear that's probably not sleep apne induc nocta that's probably excessive hydration if you're waking up a bunch of times and it's fairly small amounts of urine then it's probably not the fluid issue it's probably the fact that the basal pressent is kicking your kidneys into gear so that's not a perfect criteria but it's just like a quick little tool you can sort of use um that's actually one of the reasons why we measure almost always uh your body weight at night as well as in the morning so that that's like the combat sport in the UFC fighters boxers we call that your float so how much you floated overnight I like to know that number because I want to know as well your first morning void so when you wake up then you went to bed at 200 lb you woke up the next morning at 195 it's like oh you floated five pounds did you pee last night yeah yeah three times interesting another case you woke up you went to bed at 200 lb you wake up at should have a certain amount of fluid that you're just respirating out as you're breathing throughout your nose throughout night ideally uh guaranteed you're going to wake up what was your urine like oh yeah a little bit pretty dark like shocker you're dehydrated so you can kind of look at numbers like that a general float is something like a pound to two pounds for the 170 plus pound person as you scale up that number can go up a little bit you can kind of use these to triage a little bit about what's going on um with this kind of combination everything is everything right so it's like it's not just about one system so you're going to pay attention you can also look well I don't know if you want to jump into it we can but there's a whole bunch of ways I I can teach you to diagnose hydration and then maybe we can start there and then we can talk about hydration numbers yes I'd love to talk about diagnostics for"}

there are going to be a number of people wondering about how to breathe during repetitions and how to breathe in between sets so I'd like to just briefly touch on this and this is something that I know we're going to return to again when we have our discussion about recovery yeah but is there a general rule of thumb for how to breathe during repetitions during work y for strength maybe even strength versus hypertrophy in in a way that maximizes oxygen input to the system you know keeps you uh alert and conscious but that also protects the body by creating some rigidity in the system right because certainly being def with all your air exhaled the body is a very different beast in terms of stability than with the body full of air versus you know breathing during the repetition movement there's a a maneuver that has long been uh labeled the Vol Salva technique so what that really means is you're trying to use air to create intraabdominal pressure and what you're really trying to do is create a cylinder around your spine the real issue you have to to play here is regulation of blood pressure and spinal stability now you should be able to breathe and Brace what I mean by that is you should be able to create total intraabdominal pressure regulate uh spine control while breathing it's just very hard for a lot of people to do it's it's a skill you should absolutely work on um you can actually you can do this and you can go around like I do this trick in class and students can come and like push any part um of my entire abdomen is super tight and I can talk now it's going to be a little bit labored you can hear a little bit of a difference but you should be able to do that if you have to like hunch down and you can't even muster a breath and it takes that to create pressure you're not actually um you don't really understand the abdominal control necessary to create that stability so step number one is that's the goal now with the blood pressure thing we have to be careful because a standard blood pressure uh ideally if we sat around right now is probably something like 120 over 80 systolic versus diastolic that's a normal number right high blood pressure is something over that well with an acute bout of exercise you can see that number reaches high as like 450 over 350 which effectively means you have total blood occlusion right your blood pressure is so high blood blood is not moving anywhere and so in the middle of a very heavy set especially complex movements especially when they're loaded on your body um this could be in overhead press or or squat variations anything like that blood pressure is going to be a problem and reason why that matters is that's what's going to make you pass out it's not the fact that you ran out of oxygen in 3 seconds it's the fact that blood pressure got so high you blacked out and so we want to have we're going to have to play this game of releasing a little bit of the pressure so we can actually get blood to move a little bit making sure that we don't lose spinal stability um so we can finish our workout that's really the question you asked right how do I play this game of oh I have several hundred pounds on my back or my chest and I don't want to Exhale right so that I don't lose spinal stability but at the same time I don't want to pass out right which is a which is a problem so kind of a couple of rules of thumb if you're going to be doing something in which you can complete the entire exercise without a breath and it is of a maximal or close to load that's probably your best strategy so in that particular case you'll see a lot of breathing techniques um where you're going to take a very large inhale ideally this is done through the abdomen not the shoulders so we shouldn't seeing clavicles Rising during this thing you'll see a common mistake of of the bars on their back and you see people do this like big inhale thing and all they do is Elevate their clavicles that's not necessarily going to increase pressure through the abdomen which is what you're looking for so you want to be thinking about belly moving out in all four areas in front of you to your left and right and to your back that's that quadrant sort of idea of stabilizing your spine you can do that in independent of your clavicles moving like your shoulders don't need to rise for that you don't really need the oxygen for metabolic purposes you're just using the air for a brace that's really all you're after so you're trying to visualize your torso as more or less a cylinder yep and you're trying to fill it with air the logic being that if I were to push down onto a say a a full unopen can of soda yep water for all you sugar phobes out there soda water uh and then push as hard as I could it's going to be hard for me to crush that can but if the can were empty or if it were a little bit kinked in the middle correct then I could likely Crush that can yeah what you're really doing is you have your spinal Erectors in the back right and then a whole series of abdominal excises and you actually have some neural control symatic control of Contracting those but the you don't have muscles on the inside that you can do so you're basically bringing in air and saying I'll use air to push from the inside out and I'll use muscles to push from the outside in to create this brace and I don't want overcompression with the muscles this is a like if you if you see people that have just enormous spinal Erectors sometimes that's an indicator of of actually a poor breathing or bracing strategy because they're using spinal rectors create all their compression and not actually using the inside of enough it's not always the case but sort of like a thing to think about so overcompression through the spinal Erectors is not necessarily ideal um if you wanted the best scenario is a little bit of a brace a both so we use some air to push this side we use some musculature to press that way and then that that spine is just nicely held in position um again not in a position where I've locked down my diaphragm and I can't get any air out I should be able to get that brace pattern um and then be able to speak in fact like I'm doing it right now and you'll see like a little bit of a if you're really paying attention to my voice you can hear a little bit of a subtle difference but I should be able to do this for quite a long time right like I I I could take a maximum rep right here in this position whether I'm overhead pressing doing some sort of row like anything and feel fairy braced in in the entire quadrant this is very helpful I I'm going to work on it but can we say that a an effective way to start off in terms of breathing during repetitions would be to take a gulp of air during the lowering phase the Ecentric phase and then to Exhale during the Y concentric exertion phase I asked that because that's what I've been doing for a while and it makes me feel safe I don't know if I am and it allows me to Exhale as I exert the the U hardest portion of the exercise yeah and perhaps I also borrowed that from martial arts where one tends most often is trained to Exhale on the on the strike yep if you're going to be doing again the number of repetitions can be completed without a breath a lot of the times you're better off saving that exhalation until you complete wow but but for a reasonably heavy set of hack squats or even leg extensions and given that I already can't leg extension my body weight we establish maybe this is why um the idea of holding my breath for an entire compound set so again brings to mind um you know like where is my insurance card who's going to drive me to the hospital this kind of thing um in all seriousness what if I want to breathe during the set yeah so I'll clarify I'm generally meaning if you're doing like a one rep max or something like that okay well certainly could hold my breath for a one repetition maximum that you know maybe like a double or something like that depending on what you're doing like maybe a triple a bench breath you can probably do three and get away with it a squat it gets harder deadlift so it kind of depends on the exercise um you want to take that be breath though prior to the Ecentric portion not during so ler breathe in lock we're set and now start our movement pattern wherever it's going to be um exhaling on the concentric portion during it it is fine it's no problem um especially if you're not extremely heavy and what's your what are your thoughts on grunting and screaming yeah fine I don't care okay I don't tend to do that I'm occasionally known to squeal or whimper um but I do it person but I do it very quietly I think of you and I think squeal whimper absolutely thanks um if you're going to be doing multiple repetitions uh what we actually do for the NFL combine is we teach them a very specific Excel strategy so there's one test that they do uh which is they bench press 225 pounds for as many reps as possible a lot of these people people will get 25 to 40 repetitions so we have a very specific breathing pattern it would be something like if we think that they're going to do around 25 reps say that's like our goal we might say okay do the first 10 without without a breath and then exhale reset and then do five breath and then you might do five breath three breath two breath and then one breath per rep until we can't get any more um so we'll have very specific strategies for them um so what I would say is is think about how many you're going to complete and and then breathe according uh to that and it tends to increase in frequency as the number gets closer to failure because you're going to want that that error a little bit but you just want to make sure that when you're re when you're breathing back in you're in a safe spot so you don't want to be catching that like rebreath when the weight's on you you want to be in a locked out position or away from you when you're standing um so it tends to be like at the end of the exercise not in the middle of it um which is is going to be a recipe for problems if you take your breath then one of the reasons I'm"}

PRISCILLA CHAN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd like to talk about the CZI, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. I learned about this a few years ago, when my lab was-- and still is now-- at Stanford, as a very exciting philanthropic effort that has a truly big mission. I can't imagine a bigger mission. So maybe you could tell us what that big mission is. And then we can get into some of the mechanics of how that big mission can become a reality. PRISCILLA CHAN: So like you're mentioning, in 2015, we launched the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. And what we were hoping to do at CZI was think about how do we build a better future for everyone and looking for ways where we can contribute the resources that we have to bring philanthropically and the experiences that Mark and I have had, for me as a physician and educator, for Mark as an engineer, and then our ability to bring teams together to build the builders. Mark has been a builder throughout his career. And what could we do if we actually put together a team to build tools, do great science? And so within our science portfolio, we've really been focused on what some people think is either an incredibly audacious goal or an inevitable goal. But I think about it as something that will happen if we continue focusing on it, which is to be able to cure, prevent, or manage all disease by the end of the century. ANDREW HUBERMAN: All disease? PRISCILLA CHAN: All disease. So that's important, right? And so a lot of times, people ask like, which disease? And the whole point is that there is not one disease. And it's really about taking a step back to where I always found the most hope as a physician, which is new discoveries and new opportunities and new ways of understanding how to keep people well come from basic science. So our strategy at CZI is really to build tools, fund science, change the way basic scientists can see the world and how they can move quickly in their discoveries. And so that's what we launched in 2015. We do work in three ways. We fund great scientists. We build tools-- right now, software tools to help move science along and make it easier for scientists to do their work. And we do science. You mentioned Stanford being an important pillar for our science work. We've built what we call biohubs, institutes where teams can take on grand challenges to do work that wouldn't be possible in a single lab or within a single discipline. And our first biohub was launched in San Francisco, a collaboration between Stanford, UC Berkeley, and UCSF. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amazing. Curing all diseases implies that there will either be a ton of knowledge gleaned from this effort, which I'm certain there will be-- and there already has been. We can talk about some of those early successes in a moment. But it also sort of implies that if we can understand"}

{"question": "What is the role of dopamine in triggering motivation to pursue a desired goal or reward, and how does the drop below Baseline affect the pursuit process?", "doc_id": "K-TW2Chpz4k_5", "video_id": "K-TW2Chpz4k", "video_title": "Leverage Dopamine to Overcome Procrastination & Optimize Effort | Huberman Lab Podcast", "video_header": "Craving, Motivation, Pursuit & Reward Prediction Error", "segment_idx": "5", "time_start": "20:28", "time_end": "28:25", "context": "so let's think about dopamine Peaks and bass lines and let's remember that for every Peak there's a trough what do I mean by that well when you have a wave you also have the bottom of the wave when you have a mountain you have the bottom of the mountain when we think about dopamine Peaks and dopamine baselines we have to include that trough because that trough that is the level of dopamine below Baseline really dictates whether or not you are going to feel motivated to pursue something or not so I'm going to give you a visual in your mind the visual in your mind is an increase in dopamine that's triggered by your desire for something and really could be your desire for anything if you're hungry and you're thinking about I really want a sandwich I really want to let's think what sandwich would I want right now a really nice roast beef sandwich on sourdough with a slice of Swiss Tomatoes slice of pickle here I'm describing the sandwich that I would want so if you're hungry and you're thinking about that dopamine starts Rising this is crucially important to understand dopamine is not just released when we get the reward when we get the thing that we're pursuing dopamine is released in anticipation of what we want that increase in dopamine is by no happenstance no mistake relates also to our propensity and desire to move remember earlier I told you there's a separate Circuit of dopamine that triggers movement and that when it's depleted is causing things like deficits and movement related to Parkinson's or other movement disorders well that's not pure coincidence that's because desire and the need to move in order to pursue and reach goals are one in the same process so if I desire a sandwich or I desire a cup of coffee or I desire some water when I'm thirsty there's an increase in dopamine that we could call a little mini Peak and dopamine but then here's the key thing very soon after I realized my desire for something that Peak that was caused by the desire comes down and drops below Baseline below the level of dopamine that it was prior to even thinking about the sandwich or the coffee or the glass of water and it's that drop below Baseline that triggers my desire to go out and find that sandwich that coffee that water or that blank insert whatever it is that you happen to desire action or substance of any kind or person Etc so that drop below Baseline is fundamental to the whole process and that drop below Baseline was triggered by the preceding Peak so let's say that I desire a sandwich there's an increase in dopamine then very quickly it comes down below Baseline just a little bit now I'm in pursuit of the sandwich I'm looking for where I can get that sandwich I can order it perhaps to be delivered I can go out and find it now is the stage in which I have to think about what are the different stimuli that is the things in my environment that signal whether or not I'm likely to get that sandwich or not okay so for instance if I were to go to my phone and order food on an app or walk down the street and see the sign for a deli that's a cue that I'm likely to relieve that drop in dopamine and get not just back to Baseline but then I'll get a peak in dopamine and indeed that's what happens if I find that Deli I go into the deli they're open they're making the sandwich that I want they make my sandwich and great I get that sandwich and that sandwich will have some degree of inherent reward to it some degree of my liking it or not liking it so let's say I like it it's not the best sandwich I've ever had but all I'm doing is comparing my desire for that sandwich to the sandwich that I actually got and ate and chances are it's going to relieve that craving meaning it will take that dopamine that had fallen below Baseline up up back to Baseline and if I like the sandwich it's going to indeed increase that dopamine again to another Peak now if I love the sandwich like it's the most delicious thing that I've ever tasted in my entire life well then I'll get a big peak in dopamine when I consume that reward however chances are that sandwiches more or less as I expect it to be which is pretty good I'll eat it and I'm fine what do I mean by fine well there's a concept called reward prediction error reward prediction error says that the dopamine that it is experienced that is that's released from the VTA and nucleus accumbens is going to be of a certain value and that value is going to be compared to the desire and expectation of what I thought I was going to get so if you take what you actually got minus what you expected that's reward prediction error so if the sandwich is basically what I expected to get fine dopamine comes down basically to a baseline level that's pretty standard for me and is basically the Baseline level I had before I ever thought about the sandwich at all if the sandwich completely surprises me and is completely amazing just an amazing sandwich well then the level of dopamine that I experience when I consume that sandwich is going to be even greater and it's going to be that minus what I expected so there it's a bigger reward prediction error in the direction of higher Peak by consuming the sandwich and then of course there's the other possibility which is the deli's closed or the sandwich they make me is lousy or doesn't taste good or something happened in the consuming of that sandwich that just makes a bad experience in which case if we take that reward experienced minus reward predicted from the initial craving well then it's going to be less than what I expected and therefore the Baseline drops below where it was prior to even Desiring the sandwich okay so all of this might seem a little bit complicated but it's all very simple desire for things increases dopamine but then our level of dopamine drops below Baseline and it's that drop below Baseline that triggers the motivation to bring that dopamine level back up by going and pursuing the thing that you wanted in the first place now of course as this is happening you're not conscious of your dopamine levels you experience this as context-dependent craving and pursuit because remember the prefrontal cortex is involved in context setting and craving and pursuit because it relates to action and movement which is one of the general features of the dopamine system so you can start to see how this is a beautifully designed system and you can also see how it's a perfect system for desire and pursuit of anything not just sandwiches as I'm giving you in this somewhat trivial but every day and therefore applicable example so just by understanding reward prediction error and especially by understanding that a craving triggers a peak in dopamine that makes you motivated but then drops your level of dopamine below Baseline which makes you even more motivated you are already halfway through the conceptual aspect of today's podcast because if you can understand that you will understand why for instance when you initially want something or you think you want something it puts you into motion but then pretty quickly you're starting to feel the pain of not having that and that is also contributing to your desire to pursue that thing this is a subtle effect but if you watch for it you'll start to see it or experience it within yourself your craving for things is not just about craving for those things per se it's also a desire to relieve the pain of not having those things and if you can internalize that and start to develop an awareness around it you will be in an amazing position to leverage all sorts of aspects of the dopamine system in order to increase your motivation especially when things get really hard or when you have the propensity to procrastinate which is something that we'll get into a little bit later in the podcast I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now"}
{"question": "Is the heritability of IQ test scores significantly affected by access to nutrition, medical care, and education, which can vary greatly across different populations and communities?",

into the cognitive domain well yeah absolutely and uh you know I think I think it's good to set the stage here if we're going to be talking about heritability and human individuality and and so if I can go off on a little bit of a riff uh uh for the benefit of your of your listeners and viewers here pleas so if you look at human traits whether they are behavioral traits like shyness or very straightforward morphological traits like height uh what you tend to find is that there are very few traits that are entirely heritable where all their variability can be predicted based on the gene variance you get from your mother and father and there are a few traits that are absolutely UNH heritable but that most fall in between so let me give an example everyone in the world has either wet or dry ear wax and it turns out that this is determined by variation in a single Gene the name of the gene is boring it's abcc1 uh it's a ion transporter and uh there's a variation in this Gene gives rise to either wet or dry ear wax it doesn't matter how your parents raised you it doesn't matter what foods you ate growing up doesn't matter what what uh uh diseases your mother had when you were in the womb it's 100% heritable well does this mean that abcc1 we should call it the ear wax type Gene well no because it's not there just for that like this this Gene is expressed in cells in all parts of the body doing all kinds of things ear wax is just something that we notice genes don't code for traits they code for proteins and so we have to be careful about how we refer to them in that way um for example the wet ear wax G uh variant of the abcc 11 Gene also confers a slightly higher risk for breast cancer H uh so clearly it's not just for ear wax it's it's for a bunch of things most of which we don't yet know about but in the case of earwax this trait is 100% heritable at the other end of the scale speech accent is zero% heritable it is entirely dependent upon the speech that you experience uh in your childhood and interestingly it's the speech of your peers more than the speech of your family which which is why the children of immigrants sound like the place where they wound up not like their parents uh and there is no evidence for any degree of heritability now just to be clear I'm talking about speech accent like whether you have a high or a low voice or it's nasal or more or less resonant these are physical things having to do with the vocal tract and they are in part heritable Okay so we've got one thing that's 100% heritable one thing that's 0% heritable but where do most Things Fall most Things fall in the middle uh uh one of the most heritable traits that we know about in humans is height and in the United States height is about 85% heritable 85% of the variation in the trade of height can be explained uh by what you inherit from your mother and your father well what's the rest well it's nutrition it's the diseases you fought off it's also random variation which we'll talk about a lot later um now you might say okay well that's an estimate for people in the US is this true all over the world well no if you go to a place where people routinely don't get enough nutrition and are routinely fighting off infectious diseases like this has been studied in rural Bolivia for example or rural India now height is no longer 85% heritable it's only 50% heritable why because people in these situations where they don't get enough nourishment where they're fighting off these diseases can't live up to their genetic potential for height if you want to make things better for the people of the world then everyone needs to have basic things like the ability to learn and enough nutrition and and decent Medical Care and schools in order to fulfill their genetic potential for positive traits and uh height I've used as an example because it is very uncontroversial but we could apply the very same analysis to intelligence general intelligence now there are people who argue about do things like I Q tests really measure anything real and there's been a lot of fighting in the scientific literature about this but I think intelligence tests aren't perfect and they are sometimes culture bound but they are actually quite predictive of of of of later success and uh much more so than say sat tests or GRE tests or mcats or other standardized tests but presumably those correlate in some way they do I do but but but the IQ tests are better actually they talking about this the the classic IQ test uh I am talking about the modern variants of the classic IQ test that are administered by trained psychologists uh and aren't just a paper form and so they're not perfect and no test will be perfect but they're pretty good and so then if you ask the question what is the heritability for IQ test score uh well the answer tends to be different depending upon the population if you look uh again in in countries like the us or in Western Europe that are fairly affluent where where people uh tend to have good access to to nutrition and medical care and schooling and kids get to play and they're not and they're not traumatized by War then uh then IQ test score is heritable in the ballpark of 60 70% but if you look at people who don't have those benefits who are poor and this can be in the United States as well if you look at uh communities that that uh face discrimination and have consistently poor poor health care in schools then IQ is less heritable why for the very same reason that it is in Heights because people can't live up to their genetic potential when they don't have the basic things that everybody needs so presumably if two identical twins and I realize they aren't"}
{"question": "Can non-invasive light therapy using specific patterns of flickering light, such as 40-hertz stimulation, be used to induce gamma oscillations in the brain and potentially treat neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and dementia?", "doc_id": "UF0nqolsNZc_26", "video_id": "UF0nqolsNZc", "video_title": "Using Light (Sunlight, Blue Light & Red Light) to Optimize Health | Huberman Lab Podcast #68", "video_header": "Light Flicker Phototherapy & Neuroprotection", "segment_idx": "26", "time_start": "2:08:39", "time_end": "2:19:03", "context": "on the skin or on our eyes and the downstream health consequences of that illumination. However, one of the most important goals of science and medicine is to figure out how to change the health of our brain. And of course, our brain is contained within our skull, and therefore we can't just shine light onto the outside of our head and expect it to change the activity of neurons deep within the brain, unless those neurons are linked up with our eyes or with our skin. And as it turns out, even though there are a lot of brain areas that are connected through neural circuits and hormone circuits through our eye, and believe it or not, also to our skin, many brain areas are not. Brain areas such as the hippocampus, which is involved in learning and memory, brain areas such as our neocortex, well, some areas of our neocortex such as our visual cortex are indirectly linked to our eyes, so if we shine light in our eyes, we can change the activity of neurons in our neocortex, but there are other brain areas that are not directly or even indirectly connected to our visual system, not at least in any immediate way. So that raises the question of how do you change the activity of neurons in the brain? Well, there's pharmacology. You can take pills, you can inject drugs that will change the pharmacology of neurons and the way they operate and fire. Of course, antidepressants are one such instance, opioid drugs are another. There's a huge array of psychoactive compounds, meaning compounds that will change the levels of chemicals in your brain. Some of those work, many of them also carry side effects. It's all rather indirect, meaning you have lots of different cells in different areas of your brain that utilize the same chemicals. So a drug, for instance, to increase serotonin for sake of improving depression will also often have the effect of reducing certain neurons output of serotonin in the hippocampus and cause changes in appetite or changes in libido and so on and so forth. You could imagine using electrical stimulation, putting wires into the brain and stimulating specific brain areas in order to activate the neurons in those brain areas. And certainly that works and has been done experimentally and is done during neurosurgery exams, et cetera, but involves removing a piece of skull. So that's not very practical. In principle, light would be a wonderful way to modulate the activity of neurons deep within the brain. But again, the skull is in the way. Recent studies, however, have figured out ways that light can be delivered to the eyes to change global patterns of firing in the brain in ways that can be beneficial to the brain. And the work that I'm referring to now is mainly the work of Li-Huei Tsai at MIT, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and her colleagues. And what they've discovered that there's a particular pattern of brain activity called gamma activity. Gamma activity is one so-called wavelength of electrical activity in the brain, so not wavelengths of light, but wavelengths of electrical activity in the brain that can be restorative for certain aspects of learning and memory and can actually help create molecular changes in neurons that lead to clearance of debris and even reductions in age-related cognitive decline. So the way to think about brain waves and brain oscillations is that neurons are electrically active, that involves chemicals, et cetera. And they can be active in very slow, big waveforms. So you can think of, you know, Delta waves, meaning, so you can imagine a wave of electrical activity that comes along very infrequently. So a given neuron fires, and then some period of time later fires, and then some period of time even later fires. Or you can imagine that that same cell is very active, fires, fires, fires, fires, fires. You can imagine if it's firing very often, it's going to be short wavelength, right? Shorter gaps between firing. Or if it's firing very seldom, you're going to think about that as longer wavelength firing. Turns out that gamma waves are one pattern of firing that lead to downstream metabolic functions and biological functions that end up clearing away debris that's associated with aging in cells and that also lead to molecular changes that enhance the kind of youthfulness of neurons, so to speak. How do we induce gamma oscillations within the brain? Well, what Li-Huei Tsai and colleagues have beautifully shown is that by delivering certain patterns of light flicker, so lights going on and off at a particular frequency, the brain as a whole starts to entrain, meaning it matches to those particular patterns of light flicker, even though many of the brain areas that do this are not directly within the visual system or visual pathway. So the studies that I'm referring to are several, but the one that I'd like to highlight is entitled, Gamma Entrainment Binds Higher-Order Brain Regions and Offers Neuroprotection. What they essentially did was to expose subjects to 40 hertz, which is a particular frequency of illumination, to the eyes. So it's light goes on, light goes off, light goes on, light goes off at a frequency of 40 hertz. And when they did that and they recorded the activity of neurons within the brain, not just within the visual areas of the brain, but within other areas as well, they observed increased gamma oscillations, meaning that the electrical activity of the brain at large started to match to the patterns of light that were delivered to the eyes. This is really exciting and very unique from the different types of phototherapies that we've been talking about up until now. All the patterns of phototherapy that we've been talking about up until now involved constant illumination with a given wavelength. Here, it is wavelength generating patterns of illumination, light on, light off, light on, light off, at a particular frequency. So what they found, for instance, using this pattern of stimulation, and by the way, the stimulation was called genus, gamma entrainment using sensory stimulation, so G-E-N-U-S, gamma entrainment using sensory stimulation, had a number of really interesting effects. First of all, it reduced so-called amyloid plaques and phosphorylated tau. Amyloid plaques and phosphorylated tau are associated with Alzheimer's and normal age related cognitive decline. So this is incredible, right? A pattern of flashing light delivered to the eyes creates a pattern of neuronal firing, not just in the visual areas of the brain, but in other areas of the brain as well, that in turn trigger molecular pathways that reduce some of the markers and the cause age-related cognitive decline in Alzheimer's. And in parallel to that, they observed an upregulation of some of the biological pathways that lead to enhancement of neuronal function, maintenance of synapses, which are the connections between neurons, and so on, and so on. They have discovered and list out a huge number of these biological effects, both the reduction in bad things, so to speak, and the improvement in good biological pathways. And I find these studies so exciting because, first of all, they're non-invasive, right? There's no drilling through the skull. They are very tractable in the experimental sense, meaning that you can imagine that if 40 hertz stimulation turns out to be the very best stimulation protocol to induce these gamma oscillations, well, great, but because it's non-invasive, it's fairly easy to explore 50 hertz stimulation, 100 hertz stimulation, 20 hertz stimulation, and to do that with different wavelengths of light. And so that's what's happening now. The Tsai lab and other labs are really starting to explore the full range of variables that can impact oscillations within the brain and their downstream consequences. So again, this is phototherapy, but phototherapy of a very different sort that we've been talking about up until now. It's phototherapy designed to trigger activation of biological pathways far away from the very tissue that's being illuminated. And it calls to mind the same sorts of mechanisms that we were talking about earlier, where illumination of the skin with UVB light is setting off an enormous number of different cascades in different organs and tissues, including the spleen, the testes, the ovaries, and so on. So again, light has these powerful effects, both locally on the cells that the light is delivered to, but also systemically in terms of the cells that are changing their electrical and chemical outputs, are modifying lots and lots of biological programs. Is there an actionable tool related to these studies yet? Well, that sort of depends on how adventurous you are. Right now, these studies are being explored in the context of clinical trials, in people with Alzheimer's, dementia, and other forms of neurodegeneration. Is it dangerous to look at a 40-hertz flickering light? Well, in general, the answer is going to be no. However, if you're prone to epilepsy, for instance, staring at a flickering light of a given continuous frequency can induce seizure, right? That might surprise some of you, but it shouldn't, because as this study illustrates and as anyone who's ever been out at night to a club or something illustrates, when you look at a strobe light, for instance, your whole world of visual perception changes, but actually, the rhythm at which you perceive music, at which you perceive conversation, at which you perceive the movement of your body actually changes according to the patterns of visual flicker, in most cases, strobe, if we're using the sort of club dancing example. Your brain is in training to its outside environment. So given the power of flickering lights to entrain brain rhythms, I think at this stage, it's probably too preliminary to really suggest a specific protocol, but I would definitely keep an eye out for these sorts of studies. They are coming out all the time. And I think in a very short period, we are going to see specific protocols that one could use even at home, and of course, these are non-invasive protocols, in order to place the brain into a particular state, not just for sake of offsetting neurodegeneration, but also for enhancing focus, for enhancing the transition into sleep, and other brain states as well. Today, I covered what I would say is a lot of information."}
{"question": "How can I use regular meal times that fit my natural circadian rhythm, combined with adequate light exposure, to regulate my hunger and eating behavior effectively?", "doc_id": "oUu3f0ETMJQ_17", "video_id": "oUu3f0ETMJQ", "video_title": "Dr. Samer Hattar: Timing Light, Food, & Exercise for Better Sleep, Energy & Mood", "video_header": "Effects of Light on Appetite; Regular Light & Meal Times", "segment_idx": "17", "time_start": "1:08:19", "time_end": "1:18:02", "context": "are about to start talking over each other and arguing, that's always the goal when we talk, right? - That's right. - Unlike other scientists I interact with, when Samer and I get together, it's considered a successful conversation if we get into a big fight, and then go for a big meal- - That's right. - Where I pick the restaurant. Okay, so let's talk about food and eating and appetite. You had yet another, yes, I greatly admire your success in this way, yet another incredible discovery showing that there are direct effects of light on appetite and feeding behavior. Okay, maybe you could just summarize those results for people. - Honestly, that paper is the one that allowed us to come with the tripartite model, because we were thinking completely wrong about it. We wanted, this experiment, it'd be fun for your audience to hear why we started this experiment. Remember that when we discovered the ipRCGs, we figured if they are the only relay to entrain the circadian clock, then you could kill them and have an animal opposite to the one that we spoke or a human opposite to the one that we spoke about earlier. Where instead of having no pattern vision and have circadian photoentrainment, we could produce an animal that have pattern vision, but no circadian photoentrainment. - Hm, so circadian blind. - Circadian blind, but pattern sighted. And we succeeded in that. The problem when you have these animals, which I've told you many times already is that they don't adjust to the day-night cycle. So doing experiments on them become very complicated. - What is their behavior like if you don't have these cells? Are they awake and then asleep, awake and then asleep? - They just drift like the humans we've talked about. - They think they're in Las Vegas with no clocks or watch- - They drift, exactly. - They stay up later every night and go to sleep- - They can either, depend on their clock. If their clock is shorter, they come in earlier. If their clock is longer, they come in later. - So they're really messed up? - They really don't adjust to it. If they were in the wild, they'll be eliminated in a second, right? There is no way they'll survive. So, me and Diego started talking and we're like, what if we use non-light in training agent? And what is the strongest non-light in training agent? Food. So we thought that the light defective animals will have more sensitivity to food entrainment because as you know more than me, this is an area that you've worked really well on, for vision, if you're image blind, your hearing and somatosensory get improved, right? The lack of vision improves your hearing and sensation. But we found actually that if you don't have the light to system, actually the food ability to entrain the animal goes completely to the ground. Completely opposite to what we predicted. - So light viewing and feeding behavior are interacting in ways that support one another. - And that's why we came with the tripartite model. We figured it's different than sensation of the environment. When you sense with vision, vision and hearing interact, but your vision is a real full modality. You want to see. That's what vision wants to do. You want to hear. That's what hearing wants to do. You want to sense. That's what sensing want to do. But for the circadian system, light, food, all these entraining agent, they somehow have to interact to keep a coherent system. You don't just assume if you remove light, this one is going to be stronger. No, they need to know each others. The light informs when the animal is going to eat. - Well, what I like about this so much is that in the world outside of science, in which I don't really exist in, but that I see a lot of, this kind of wellness and stuff with all this mind-body integration stuff. It's interesting because people view the body more as a system, right? A system of organs that interact, as opposed to the way that standard science and medical profession is like, you work on the liver or you're ear, nose and throat, or heart and lung, or brain or- - Wow, that's a great way of thinking about it. - But the biology is integrated. - Yeah. - And so, for somebody who's interested in effecting their eating behavior, something that you are familiar with, and that we will talk more about your experiences of in a moment, how should they use light in order to adjust their eating behavior? - Right. So, now that I've told you about all these interaction between the different inputs to the circadian clock, just you think about it as an engineer, what would be the best thing? The best thing is to know when your food times happen in the day, when should you get light, and when is your circadian clock in your system, right? So, if you eat at very specific times of the day, that's another signal that is telling your body, your clock, you're in a certain time of the day. So if you're having lunch at the correct time every day, and you're getting bright light, now you have two systems that are informing your clock, your clock is going to be better. - So regular mealtimes? - Regular mealtimes that fit your circadian clock. So, and in fact, if you do that, when I started doing this, and it helped me lose weight, is that I'm exposing myself to the right amount of light-dark cycle, I'm eating at regular time. It is amazing. You would be not hungry, let's say you eat at noon, you will not feel any hunger at 11:45. And then all of a sudden the hunger jumps. This is clearly not an energy issue because it could not be that drastic. - No, the desire to eat is mainly driven by these cues, these hormone cues that are very exquisitely timed to- - Exactly. - Sleep-wake cycle, but also to light. - Exactly. And you know, in the wild, you could imagine why energy level through the arcuate nucleus- - You should explain to people what the arcuate is 'cause I don't think we've done that adequately. The arcuate nucleus is an area of the hypothalamus that drives hunger and feeding behavior. And what we're talking about is the fact that it's taking cues from your viewing of light, believe it or not, is impacting your level of hunger. And this is a non-trivial way in which your timing of hunger and amount of hunger is regulated by when and how much light you view. So, let me ask you a couple of practical- - But can I just, this is really, before you asked me- - Sure. - Sorry, Andrew. We said we are going to fight, but to me, the interesting thing to think about it, in the wild when you didn't have the availability of food that we have, the arcuate plays a huge important role because if you weren't successful in getting food, then the arcuate is going to tell you, look, you have to take risks and go get food because your energy level is very low. And that's great, there's tons of great research about that. But I think what's missing is the fact in humans, we're not getting to a situation... Most of us, we're not getting to a situation where we have low energy levels. Most of the time actually we eat not because we are really have low energy, but because we want to eat. So I think that's why I feel that the timing is very important for us because we always have enough energy level for us to eat. - Well, I mean, I enjoy eating so much that I'll eat just for the sensation of chewing. - True, true. - I mean, I enjoy the taste too. - True, absolutely. - And I enjoy the social aspects when those are a part of it. - Absolutely. - But I literally enjoyed the physical act of chewing. - Absolutely, absolutely. Uh huh. - Which explains a lot. Okay, so how regular are you or do you recommend people be about mealtimes? Because what I'm hearing is that light viewing behavior is pretty straightforward. Get a lot of light in the morning and throughout the day, minimize it in the evening and at night, generally speaking, for sake of mood and circadian rhythm. But for sake of regulating timing and quality I should also say of food intake, because people clearly make better choices about food intake when they are anticipating a meal and they aren't constantly hungry. And so, the ability to regulate hunger for particular phases of the circadian cycle is quite valuable for all people. Not just people trying to lose weight, but all people. Are we talking about down to the minute? - Absolutely not. - All right, so 12:00 noon is my normal lunch, let's say plus or minus? - Half an hour. - Okay. So eat around between 11:30 and 12:30. - If that's the time. And it depends if you also do multiple meals. Remember three meals, that's a decision that somebody came up with, I don't know why. - And nowadays, fewer people are doing that I think. - Yeah. - Given our friend, Satchin Panda's work. - Right. I mean, so you could have two meals, you could have very multiple meals that are distributed across your active time. I agree with Satchin Panda's work that try to avoid eating when your system is supposed to be relaxing, when you're supposed to be at non-active times. So, limit your eating to the active time of your cycle. And that seemed to be, and Joe Takashi is doing some beautiful stuff on this, that seems to be incredibly important for aspect of the circadian. - And for health. - And for health. - Yeah, we're referring to Satchin Panda's work, he wrote a beautiful book called \"The Circadian Code.\" Maybe Samer, with some luck you'll write a book as well. Meaning the world will be lucky to have that book, but Satchin's data really strongly point to the fact that liver health, brain health, metabolic factors, and endocrine factors of various systems and organs all seem to benefit from having a period of each 24 hour day in which we are not eating anything and then eating at very regular mealtimes. - Absolutely. - Let's talk about eating and mealtimes"}
{"question": "What are some common causes of vision problems, such as eye drift or double vision, and how can I determine if I have a dominant eye?", "doc_id": "ObtW353d5i0_24", "video_id": "ObtW353d5i0", "video_title": "The Science of Vision, Eye Health & Seeing Better", "video_header": "Protocol 12: Determine Your Dominant Eye; Near-Far Training", "segment_idx": "24", "time_start": "1:24:51", "time_end": "1:27:56", "context": "And so for me, if I cover up my right eye, I see much less well, much more poorly. It's a little bit fuzzy, and I have to work harder in order to see the camera for instance. Then, if I cover up my left eye, it's actually really easy for me to relax. I have a dominant eye. Now, you can balance that out by covering up the dominant eye a little bit each day, but I would warn any young people, meaning, you know, 12 or younger, against creating these imbalances if there isn't a clinical need to do that. And if you do have strong imbalances between the two eyes, which can be caused by cataract and lens issues, can be caused by neuromuscular issues, et cetera, to try and get those dealt with as early as possible by contacting a really good ophthalmologist and ideally a neuro-ophthalmologist. It is very normal, I should say, it's very common for young children, babies to have an eye that, with strabismus, that either deviates out or that deviates in. It is important to correct that. If you would like to have balanced division between the two eyes and for the brain to respond equally to the two eyes and to have, I would say high fidelity, quality vision. Although some people who have an eye that drifts can function normally in life, you have an opportunity early in life to rescue that. I won't do, well, maybe I will do this, but I can actually relax this eye. It's so weak, in some cases, that it actually can start to deviate. Here, I'll just do this here. It's not crossing my eyes. So I actually can move my, I can misalign my eyes, because I have to fight very hard to have the musculature for this eye, keep that eye aligned with the other eye. And that's because I've been doing eye exercises, since I was in my twenties, 'cause I noticed when I would study a lot, this eye would start to drift in, I'd start to see double, and I would then, next thing you know, I was just covering the eye up, and it was getting weaker and weaker, just like the atrophy of a muscle. So I went to the doctor, what did they do? They did the exact wrong thing. The optometrist I went to gave me a prism, which adjusted it so that I could see things normally, which just made the eye weaker and weaker. It's like putting a weak arm into a sling. So I had to spend at least three years of 10 minutes a day, is what I recommend, doing near-far, covering up my good eye, doing near-far with my bad eye. And now, it's been about 10, 12 years that I have pretty decent binocular vision. Now, many of you aren't dealing with this, or have these early childhood issues. Some of you might be experiencing challenges with fatigued eyes or with differences in focus with the two eyes. These eye exercises of near-far, smooth pursuit, and checking for dominant and non-dominant eye can be very beneficial. I'm again, I'm not a clinician, so I don't want to, you know, give you protocols or enforce protocols on anybody. You need to figure out what's right and safe for you, given your vision history. I do recommend talking to a really good ophthalmologist if you have severe vision problems of any kind, or if you want to offset vision problems of any kind. An optometrist as well, but ideally would be a neuro-ophthalmologist. Okay, I did mention hallucinations, and they're fun to talk about and think about. And for years, people have asked, why do people get visual hallucinations."}
{"question": "How can taking a step back and broadening one's field of view, or detaching from a situation, help improve decision-making and reduce stress in everyday life?", "doc_id": "__RAXBLt1iM_22", "video_id": "__RAXBLt1iM", "video_title": "Jocko Willink: How to Become Resilient, Forge Your Identity & Lead Others | Huberman Lab Podcast 104", "video_header": "Tools: Strategies to Detach from Situation", "segment_idx": "22", "time_start": "2:56:00", "time_end": "3:08:25", "context": "Is it an active process, where you go, I'm going to detach from this. I'm going to put myself in a situation that is pulling on me. There's this gravitational force, and I'm going to create some imagery in my mind of walking away from it. Do I physically walk away from it? Do I outsource it to somebody else? What are some tools for detachment? JOCKO WILLINK: Yeah, this is one of those situations where you and I had a discussion about the science and the practical application aligned. So my original experience with detachment was-- and this is one of those moments where I said a lot of times things are just small moments over time, and you make a little adjustment. This is one of those moments in my life. And I wrote about in Leadership Strategy and Tactics where I recognized like in a moment what detachment was and how helpful it was. I'm on an oil rig doing a training mission. My whole platoon is in a skirmish line looking at a large area of the oil rig that we're supposed to be clearing. Again, this is not combat. This is in the 90s. There's nothing going on. We're just doing training. And I'm standing in the skirmish line. And by the way, I'm the youngest and most junior guy in my platoon. And I'm standing there looking down the sight of my weapon, and I'm waiting for someone to make a call and tell us what to do. And I wait for 5 seconds, and I wait for 10 seconds, and I wait for 20 seconds, and no one's saying anything. And we're waiting for a leader in my platoon to make a call to tell us what to do, to tell me what to do. And finally after 30 seconds which seems like an eternity, I can't take it anymore. And so I take a step like a foot, a 1-foot step, 12 inches. I take a step off the skirmish line. I look to my left. I look to my right. And what I see is every other guy in my platoon is staring down their weapon, staring down the sight of the weapon, which means their field of view is tiny. It's like a 20-degree field of view. You're looking down the scope of your weapon, or the sight of your weapon, and that's how big their field of view is. And I'm looking, and I'm thinking, oh, there's my platoon commander. He's looking down the scope-- the sight of his weapon. There's my platoon chief, he's looking down the sight of his weapon. There's my leading petty officer, he's looking down the sight of his weapon. There's my assistant platoon commander, he's looking down-- so everyone in the platoon is looking down sight side of their weapon, which means they all have a very narrow field of vision. Well, when I take a step back and look to my left and look to my right, guess what kind of field of vision I got? I got a massive one. I can see the whole scene, and I can see exactly what it is we need to do. And at that moment-- look, as a new guy, you need to keep your mouth shut. You don't say anything. And I'm thinking, well, but no one else is saying anything. So I muster up all the courage I can, and I open my mouth and I say, hold left, clear right, which is a basic tactical call. No, this is not a patent-level genius maneuver. It's just a normal call to make in a situation that we were in. I say, hold left, clear right. And I'm expecting to get slapped, told, shut up, new guy. But instead, everyone just repeats the call, hold left, clear right, hold left, clear right. And we execute the maneuver, and we finish the clearance of this oil rig. And we get done, we get to the top of the oil rig, which means we cleared the whole thing. We're on the helo deck at the top, and we go into a debrief. And now I'm expecting, OK, now, I'm going to get told, hey, what were you doing? You need to keep your mouth shut. And instead, the platoon chief goes, hey, Jocko, good call on the cellar deck down there. And I was like, yeah, that's right. But then I thought to myself, hold on a second. Why if I'm the youngest most junior guy in this platoon, why was I able to see what we needed to do and make that call? Why did that just happen? And then I realized it was because I took a step back. To use your term, I broadened my field of view, which allowed me to think more clearly because instead of being hyperfocused and narrowly focused, I broadened my range of vision. I took a breath before I made my call. I had take a nice breath to speak clearly. And I realized that taking a step back and detaching, I got to see infinitely more than even the most experienced guys in my platoon. And I started doing it all the time. And I started doing it in land warfare. I started doing it in urban combat. I started doing it in all these tactical training scenarios. These are just training. This is the '90s. I started doing these training scenarios, and it always allowed me to see what we needed to do. And then I started doing it when I was having conversations with people. And having a conversation with my platoon chief, and I can see that he's starting to turn a little red in the face. And we're about to argue about something. I said, oh, wait a second. I'm taking a step back look and go, he's getting mad right now, and he's the platoon chief. You better just de-escalate this thing real quick. And I'd say, hey, you know what, chief, that sounds good. Let me go relook at the plan or whatever. And so I started to do this with my normal life. It was to not get wrapped up in my own emotions. Not get wrapped up in the gun fight that was happening right in front of my face. Not to get wrapped up in the details of what was going on, but instead, take a step back, detach, look around and then you can make a much, much better decision. And it's not-- it's exponential. If you're looking down the sights of your weapon, and you take a step back, and you look around, it's exponential how much more you can see. Now, listen, if you are the only person in a gunfight, it's going to be harder for you to do that because you've got to be focused on whatever you're shooting at. But when you have 16 guys or 20 guys they're all looking in the same direction, it's very easy to be the guy that goes, I'm going take a step back, look around, make a call. So when you talk about the mechanics-- when I teach this to people now-- the mechanics of it, take a step back literally. You and I are at a meeting, there's a bunch of people this starts to get heated argument, I will literally push my chair back away from the table. Change my perspective. Widen my field of view. The other thing in the SEAL Teams you don't want to sound panicked on the radio for a couple of reasons. Number one, because when you panic on the radio, it's going to cause other people to panic. Number two, if you panic on the radio, and you sound panicked, everyone's going to make fun of you. So when you get back from the mission everyone is going to go-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Double whammy. JOCKO WILLINK: --yeah. You sounded like a baby out there. So what would I do before I would key up my radio, take a breath. And so here I'm manually slowing down my breath. I'm broadening my field of view. So if you're in a meeting, or you're in a-- you're at the supermarket parking lot, and someone starts to yell at you, take a step back, take a breath, broaden your field of view. Detach from those emotions that you're having and make some space. And that's how I go through the mechanics of detachment. Now, I can tell you right now I mean, when you do this all the time, which I do this all the time. Yeah, I don't really have to step back. But when you're starting to be able to try and do this, absolutely. Make-- And I'll tell you here's another like weird little nuance thing, lift your chin up, and put your hands down. Now, this is not in a combat situation, not in a fight. But here's the thing, when I get defensive what am I going to do? I'll raise my hands up and put my chin down. That's like a fighting mode. So if you and I are having a discussion, and I'm starting to get heated, and I'm starting to like, oh, he's not listening to me. Instead of me putting my chin down and put my hands like up to where I can put them in your face a little bit, no, I'm actually going to take a step back and say, put my chin up. It changes my perspective a little bit more, changes my visual perspective just by changing the angle of my head. Take a step back, put my hands down. I'm not being in a defensible-- I actually want to hear what you have to say. And if I start listening to what you have to say and not talking-- it's very hard to be detached when you're talking. It's another key component. You want to detach, shut your mouth. So I'm in meetings in a bunch of different companies. I'm running-- I have a bunch of-- I own a bunch of different companies. I'm in a meeting in my companies, I'm not the one that's doing all the talking. In fact, I'm doing mostly listening. When I'm in Task Unit Bruiser, my task unit, I'm not sitting there giving the entire brief. No, I'm letting the platoon chief and the platoon commanders give those briefs. And that way, I'm detached. I'm listening to what they have to say. I'm more capable of seeing what holes there are in their plans by not moving my mouth, not talking, I'm listening. So those are some of the methodologies that I use and that I advise people to use in order to effectively start down the pathway of being able to detach in various scenarios. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love it. Again, I'm saying I love it because I do love it. And thank you. I think it's a wonderful technique. We've talked before on your podcast and some of my listeners, maybe not all to this podcast will be familiar with the fact that when we narrowly focus our gaze on one target, a number of things happen. Our visual world becomes constricted, of course, but also that we start slicing time more finely. And the dopamine system tends to start doing anticipation and trying to guide and direct things in that narrow tunnel of view, whereas when we literally take on panoramic vision, so not necessarily moving our head around, although, one could, broadening our field of view or looking at a horizon, especially if we're walking. But getting that kind of-- not kind of getting a broader field of view, we slice time differently. Things don't feel as imposing on us. This is the physiological substrate underlying what you're describing. And I think it goes a step further because in that open, larger aperture of visual understanding, there's an open larger window of cognitive understanding, and new options start to surface. I mean, I think this is-- I have long been fascinated by the fact that this actually became-- I'll tell this real quick story. In 2015, I went over to Spain to do some mountaineering with Wim Hof. And this wasn't because I wanted a podcast. I didn't have any social media. I just went over there because I'd heard this guy, Wim, contacted him, and somehow arranged a trip for myself. And I went over there, and we did some crazy dangerous mountaineering that I had no business doing. Almost ripped my left leg off in a stunt that was organized by others there that I never should have done. In any case, one day I look and Wim is like crouched on the ground next to like a curb in this parking lot before our hike. And he's down there on the ground with a little stick. And I was like, what are you doing? He's like, look. And there were ants climbing up this thing. And he's like, there mountaineering this curb. And I thought, this guy's different. But then I realized we were about to do the same thing up this big face. And I thought, wow, he's able to think at these different scales and see similarities. That's pretty cool. I would have never stopped to look there, and I still remember it. And was it profound? No. But was it interesting? yeah, in the sense that things are happening at all scales all the time. And we think we know the scale to pay attention to, and we think that that's the one that matters most. And I think it's fair to say that in a gunfight, there is a scale that matters most but new options, new perspectives actually come from that broader field of view, which is what you're describing. And later that day-- it's interesting because this group going up, some of them were really challenged in the climb. And Wim went back to this example of how the ants would stack on top of one another. And he used an analogy from that to help people through this climb. And there was a beautiful pool at the top, et cetera, et cetera. Anyway, I think that these examples are in fact meaningful, especially the ones that you gave because they don't just relate to military. I mean, you can imagine around the dinner table. I've had this. Kids are there and partners there. And sometimes it's really nice to sit back and just hear it all and bask in it all. But oftentimes, new information will surface. Like you said, all I'm hearing is worries out of this person. Or they're not even really here. They're all talking about what we're going to do next time, next time, next time. And you can reanchor people like, hey, look, maybe let's focus on what we're doing here. Or sometimes people are hyperfocused on what's happening there, and they need to think about something in the future."}

that's that's definitely your wheelhouse before we do that can we inject a little sub conversation um around this because uh I neglected to bring this up earlier and I know there's a lot of curiosity about this and then we'll and then we'll uh finish off IVF can we do that sort of a pause in the IVF so the eggs are out they're frozen sperm's out it's frozen or maybe they're going to put um live sperm on non-frozen excuse me uh sperm directly onto those unfrozen eggs we'll pause there intermission for those um potential embryos um and talk about something that you've been um very uh open about which is um and a lot of people are not not frankly in your profession so I really appreciate this which is nutrition and supplementation to optimize the the health of uh egg quality and and not just for people who want to get pregnant but for but for people who believe that fertility is a proxy for overall health so I mean are there things that people should eat and not eat um things that people should supplement and not supplement in order to um optimize their fertility I mean this is definitely an interest of mine right all my fellowship research go around fundability and natural fertility and I think we really do a disservice by how medicine really is categorized by organ systems because we act like things in one place don't impact the other as if right but it's you have a body and your body and especially your hormones change and fluctuate and they're meant to they are meant to be a dynamic system but the world and the environment of which you are subjecting your body to has proven change es on both hormonal function and also when it comes to egg and sperm quality and so if you are somebody who just wants to live your healthiest life and have your most regular periods and have your hormones as well balanced as they can be for a lack of a better word we'll just say that that means that they're functioning normally then paying attention to the things that you do are really important and so I know this is a big one for you sleep is probably the number one thing that people don't do that does impact their reproductive hormone system and therefore can impact egg and sperm quality because sleep is when you have cellular repair and when you can drop your inflammation levels we know that inflammation is just toxic to eggs and sperm it is the inflammatory environment is not ideal for conception and then for a female you have to deal with the fact that you have your egg quality but you also have how inflammation or what you're exposed to impacts your uterine environment so you have a a twofold situation here so none of this should be shocking news when it comes to nutrition but it is not talked about enough you're right decreasing inflammation by the foods that we put in our body is consistently shown with an improvement in fundability an improvement in ovulation and an improvement in success with IVF and a decrease in miscarriage right huge Studies have looked at these now the Vic caveat is that nutrition studies are super hard because people who consume flax for example tend to have other good health behaviors that sometimes make it hard to identify what flax did versus their General Health versus somebody who eats fast food every day so nutrition studies tend to be observational and Fertility Studies are really hard too because what inpoint are you using is it getting pregnant is it live birth are you looking at IVF are you looking at natural fertility and we have a lot of different overlap that makes both of these a little bit difficult and so they're all cohort based or population based studies where you analyze how people perform when it comes to fertility treatments or getting pregnant naturally based on their exposures to certain things diets high in fruits and vegetables are good for you right fiber antioxidants fruit is not bad fruit got this really bad reputation really I love fruit I love fruit too but people think that it has sugar and that it's bad for you it has fructose but no it's not that type of sugar is not bad for you if we can just agree on the fact that fruit has a lot of nutritional benefit especially when it comes to vitamins and antioxidants that can be extremely beneficial in decreasing inflammation grains so whole grains especially that your body you know provide a lot of great fiber so of course if you have Celiac or you're gluten intolerant you're a different category but there was so much focus on keto and people eliminating grains as a food group overall and even though that might be UTI itiz in a dietary strategy to lose weight and losing weight can improve fertility likely because of inflammation being the primary driver because we know that even in studies where I take donor eggs and I transfer that embrio into somebody who's overweight they have lower odds of success than if they were a normal BMI so we can't act like that causation is just on egg quality from obesity right there's also some inflammation some inflammatory changes that impact the body's ability or desire to allow an embryo to implant so fruits veggies whole grains are all good interestingly you know dairy dairy tends to be okay in most studies but what we do see is that if you're going to have dairy have whole have the real thing the processed Dairy the skim milk that actually decreases your fertility and likely because the pro processing to make it still look like milk when you take out the fat is adding in things that are unnatural potentially impacting your fertility I don't drink milk anymore but when I was a teenager I drank half and half I'm not recommending anyone do that remember I was a skin teenager I was you were trying to bul up well no I just could afford to I wasn't trying at that age I wasn't trying to at all but um it was just delicious um but so cheeses um whole uh full fat milk yogurt half and half yogurt okay yeah but don't don't choose the skim one choose the actual one that comes with some of the milk fat fat is not bad for you there's also this right hopefully we're getting away from it but there's been such a lowfat craze or this real attention that fat is so bad but fat comes in so many important forms avocados and oils and nuts Dairy meat fat and cholesterol are the backbone for all hormones right so you need that in order for your body to make the estrogen and progesterone that it needs to allow this whole process to happen and so there's this idea that those are bad for you that's just really not so healthy fats whole grains fruits veggies and what about proteins and meats because I think within those categories you know I a big fan of"}

{"question": "What are the specific symptoms of major depression, and how can they be distinguished from other emotional states?", "doc_id": "Xu1FMCxoEFc_2", "video_id": "Xu1FMCxoEFc", "video_title": "Understanding & Conquering Depression", "video_header": "Major Depression", "segment_idx": "2", "time_start": "11:21", "time_end": "18:34", "context": "The phrase major depression is used to distinguish one form of depression from the other, the other one being bipolar depression. Bipolar depression, sometimes called bipolar disorder, is really characterized by manic highs. So where people aren't sleeping and they're talking very fast, and they're buying things and pursuing resources that they can't afford, they're starting relationships left and right, they're manic, followed by periods of crashes of feeling very low, lethargic, and so on. Bipolar depression is an absolutely crucial thing for us to discuss. And therefore we are going to have an entire separate episode related to bipolar depression. Today, we're going to talk about major depression, also sometimes called unipolar depression, just because it doesn't have the highs and lows. It's more characterized by the lows. We're going to talk about the biology, the psychology, and the various treatments, behavioral, drug, supplementation, diet, exercise, all of that. Before we go forward into the material, I just want to emphasize that any discussion about mood disorders carries with it a particular sensitivity, and that sensitivity is one related to self-diagnosis. Today's episode, and indeed in the future episodes for this month on mood disorders, you're going to hear various symptomologies that are used to diagnose and characterize these disorders. If you recognize some of these symptomologies in yourself or in others that you know, that's an important thing to take note of. However, accurate diagnosis really should be done by a qualified healthcare professional. So at once I'm saying, keep your eyes and your ears up for things that sound familiar to you that might be of concern. And at the same time, I'm saying don't necessarily leap to conclusions. Take those flags of concern if they're there and bring them to a qualified healthcare professional, and they'll be able to properly diagnose you as having a particular mood disorder or diagnose somebody as having a particular mood disorder or not. And that's an essential step. I don't say this to protect us, I said this really to protect you. Okay, let's have a fact-based discussion about depression. And I promise you that where we don't know certain things about depression, I will be clear to tell you. In fact, we are going to talk about some treatments for depression that are looking very promising, and that right now are actually being used more and more. And from my read of the mechanistic literature, we're still a bit in the dark as to how these work. That's actually a common theme of medicine. Many times there are treatments that seem promising or that look really terrific. And there isn't a lot of understanding about mechanism. However, any good discussion about neuroscience and in particular about mood disorders, has to get into mechanisms. So we're going to do that. And in doing that, we're going to frame the discussion for the tools of how to keep depression at bay and how to deal with it if you happen to find yourself depressed, or if you know somebody else who's depressed. What is this thing we call depression? Was I mentioned before, it has two forms, bipolar depression, which we're not talking about today, and major depression, also called unipolar depression is the other. Major depression impacts 5% of the population. That is any enormous number. That means if you're in a class of 100 people, five of them are dealing with major depression or have at some point. Look around you in any environment and you can be sure that a good portion of the people that you're surrounded by is impacted by depression, or will be at some point. So this is something we really have to take seriously and that we want to understand. It is the number four cause of disability. A lot of people miss work, miss school, and before then likely perform poorly in work or school due to major depression. Now there's a very serious challenge in having a discussion about depression and it relates directly to the challenges in diagnosing depression. Earlier, I did an episode with Dr. Karl Deisseroth, who is indeed a medical doctor and a PhD. He's a psychiatrist. And he made a very important point, which is that the field of psychiatry and psychology are confronted with a challenge, which is they're trying to understand what's going on within the stuff that's in our brains that's deep to our skulls. We don't have access to that without brain imaging and electrodes and things like that. Someone just comes into the office and the dissection tool for depression so to speak is language. In order to determine if somebody has depression or not, we have to use language, how they talk about things, also how they carry their body. Also some general patterns of health. So let's talk about depression the way that clinicians talk about depression, because one of the issues is that we use the word depression loosely. A lot of people say, \"Oh, I'm so depressed. \"I didn't get this job or I'm so depressed. \"I just don't know, I had a really rough week \"or I'm exhausted. \"I'm so depressed or I'm so depressed \"I thought I was going to go on vacation \"and then they canceled the flight.\" Okay. That is not clinical depression. That's called being bummed out, being sad or disappointed. Now that person might be depressed, but clinical depression actually has some very specific criteria. And those criteria are mainly characterized by the presence of certain things and the absence of a few particular things. So let's talk about the things that are present in somebody that has major depression. First of all, there tends to be a lot of grief. There tends to be a lot of sadness. That's no surprise. The threshold to cry is often a signature of depression. Now that doesn't mean that if you cry easily, that you're depressed. Some people cry more easily than others, but if you're somebody who typically didn't cry easily and suddenly you find yourself crying very easily, that could be a sign of depression. And I want to emphasize, could. There's also this thing that we call anhedonia, a general lack of ability to enjoy things, things that typically or previously we enjoyed. Things like food, things like sex, things like exercise, things like social gatherings, a kind of lack of enjoyment from those things. Sometimes that lack of enjoyment is sad, and sometimes it's just flat, it's just kind of neutral. It doesn't feel good because nothing there. It's like bland food. It's like these experiences are analogous to biting into your favorite article of food and it just not tasting very good. It just doesn't taste like anything at all. And that's a common symptom of major depression. The other one is guilt. Oftentimes people with depression will feel very guilty about things they have done in the past, or they'll just generally feel badly about themselves. And we're going to talk about this because it relates to some of the more serious symptomology seen in depression sometimes, things like self harm, mutilation, or even suicide. But for the time being, we want to frame up anhedonia, this lack of ability to achieve or experience pleasure, or kind of a flat affect as it's called. Sometimes even delusional thinking, negative delusional thinking, and in particular anti-self confabulation."}
{"question": "What are some simple yet effective ways to optimize my workspace and promote alertness, especially when working long hours or trying to stay focused during demanding tasks?", "doc_id": "Ze2pc6NwsHQ_8", "video_id": "Ze2pc6NwsHQ", "video_title": "Optimizing Workspace for Productivity, Focus, & Creativity", "video_header": "Body Posture", "segment_idx": "8", "time_start": "31:24", "time_end": "34:19", "context": "Now with reference to posture, there are beautiful data illustrating that when we are standing up, those same neurons in our brainstem, locus coeruleus neurons, which release I should mention things like norepinephrin and epinephrin, those neurons become active when we are standing. They become even more active when we are ambulatory, when we are moving and we will talk about treadmilling and cycling at your desk and so forth in a little bit. But when you sit, they become a little less active and when you lie down and indeed, any time that you start to get your feet up above your waist or your head tilted back, those neurons fire less and neurons in your brain that are involved in calming, and indeed putting you to sleep, start increasing their level of firing. It's a really beautiful system. So beautiful, in fact, that there are studies that show that as you adjust the angle of the body back, you actually get a sort of dose-dependent increase in sleepiness and calmness and a dose-dependent decrease in alertness. And so, as we were all told to sit up straight or even better, just stand up straight, and now I'm also telling you to get that visual thing that you're attending to, screen or otherwise, up in front of you, or ideally above you, those things combine to generate maximum alertness. So you can think about how you might work this into various aspects of your homework environment or office work environment. But as I describe this, many of you are probably thinking what I'm thinking, which is, gosh, most of what we do is in complete opposite direction to all of this neurobiologically grounded advice. Most of us are looking down at our laptop while seated, or we are lying down, which is going to make us more sleepy, or we are positioning our computers in front of us, but we really aren't an environment that's bright enough and so on and so forth. So as you can tell, we're starting to layer in the various things that you can do, first brightness in the room, second, get that screen up and try and put yourself into a posture for work that lends itself or promotes alertness if indeed, you want to be alert for that work. If your goal is to take a nap, get your feet elevated about 10 to 15 degrees above your head, maybe put a pillow underneath it, lie down and take a nap, but that's not what we're talking about today, we're talking about workspace optimization. And I suppose you could also exploit that all-nighter trick that I talked about earlier, I actually did this, when I was an undergraduate, I was a little bit masochistic in this way. I would drink coffee and water at fairly high volume. I wasn't forced drinking or anything like that, but I actually wouldn't allow myself to get up and use the bathroom except on a timer. So I think the longest ever went was three and a half hours. It was kind of excruciating, I actually don't think that's necessarily a healthy advice, but again, you can use slight, I mentioned slight over consumption of fluids in order to generate alertness. That was just me really trying to get as much work done as I could, I had a very, very demanding class schedule and it was just the only way that I could get work done. If I was getting up every few minutes, use the restroom, I found it hard to re-engage in that work and maintain focus, which is what I just want to briefly mention now. I talked about this in the episode on focus,"}

I realize, it's early days for this, but I think there's a lot of concussion out there, sadly. There's a lot of TBI, traumatic brain injury. - Yeah. - Not just from sports. I think people sometimes forget that it's not, the major source of traumatic head injury is not football. It's not hockey. It's not boxing. It's not any of that stuff. It's construction workers, - Ah, yeah! - and it's- - Yeah. - I mean, if you've ever seen the helmets that construction workers wear. I mean, that- - The jackhammer, - Yeah. - oh, my god. - The jack hammer- - I mean, how could that not be just like- - Yeah. I have a colleague that works on this in bioengineering. And when you look at the... You know, we always think sports, but there are many people who make a living in a way that is, over time, is detrimental to their brain, and they don't have the option of just not being a professional athlete, or something of that sort. - And if they're not doing the construction, someone else needs to it- - Someone else has to do it, right. And for some reason, and I, too, I didn't occur to me until I heard it, like the people who are doing construction. And then, of course, bike accidents, and falls, and things like that as well. So- - Military. - Military, absolutely. - Yeah. - So what do you think is the potential for these compounds, particular psilocybin, but other compounds as well, for the treatment and possible even reversal of neurological injuries, and what sorts of things are you excited to do in that realm? - Yeah, so this is definitely on the more exploratory end. So it's based upon... You know, this is sort of beyond the improvement of psychiatric disorders, like depression, or depression anxiety associated with a terminal illness, or a substance use disorder, the addiction. So those are sort of psychiatric disorders. So this is... There are anecdotes of people saying, that psychedelics have helped heal their brain. They've been in one of these situations, like in sports, a sport where there's repetitive head impact, and they're claiming that using psychedelics has actually improved their cognitive function, for example, improve their memory, including improve their mood. But it's kind of more of the cognitive function, things like memory are... Now, the caveat is, if you've successfully improved someone's depression, you can get some cognitive improvement too, - Sure. - but that's more of a weaker, more indirect effect. But if you take these anecdotes, and you combine it way across orders of analysis to the rodent research from several labs, like David Olson, Brian Roth, these folks that have shown different forms of neural plasticity unfolding after, like sort of post-acutely. so after, in the days following the administration of psychedelic compounds, a variety of psychedelic compounds, and even some non-psychedelic structural analogs, that you see these different forms of neural plasticity. So the growth of dendrites, and new connections being formed with different neurons. Those effects may be at play, and then prove, in the psychiatric treatments that we're dealing with, that we don't know that. It seems like a decent guess, and we're going to be figuring out whether that's the case. But another potential that sets up, is that maybe that's, what's going on with these claims of improvements from neurological issues, that there's actually repair of the brain from injuries underlying things that... Situations where there's repetitive head impact, perhaps there's a potential for helping folks recover from stroke, and disorders like that. There's a wide variety of disorders. Now, it's a bit of magic, and a bit of like, it's something that the enthusiasts kind of can do some hand waving, and claim that this is already known. It is more exploratory. But what I'm hoping to do with some work with retired athletes who had been exposed. By the nature of their sport, for example, MMA athletes in the UFC who have been exposed to repetitive head impacts, like a lot of sports expose people to, and who are retired from the sport, and are suffering from, say, depression, which can, impart, result from those types of, that history of head impact. See if we can fix the depression, but then also as a cherry on top, in a more exploratory aim, see if we can have evidence of improvement in cognitive function, and associate like using MRI to see if it affects gray matter over time, these types of things, to see if there actually is some evidence of this improved, like this more direct repair of the brain. But again, it is very sort of like, we've got some rodent data. We've got some human anecdotes. - We will acknowledge it's early days, and we look forward to seeing the data. I appreciate how cautious you are, attentive you are. You're not drawing any conclusions. I think from a purely logical and somewhat mechanistic perspective, I mean, if we assume that lack of ability to focus, or degradation and mood is the reflection of neurons in the brain, I think we can agree on that, some dialogue between neurons and the brain, and that what needs to be changed is the nature of that dialogue, aka, neural plasticity. We know that reordering of neural circuitry require, in the adult, requires these things, like intense focus, followed by rest, et cetera. But the basis for that, like beneath, focuses the mechanism, is a mechanism, rather, beneath the bin that we call deep rest is a mechanism, and those mechanisms are neuromodulator driven. So, to me, you're... I'm not reviewing your grant. But from a rational perspective, it seems that drugs that increase certain neuromodulators, like serotonin or dopamine, in a controlled way, and then coupling that with learning of some sort, sensory input of some sort, it makes sense that would lead to, could, I should say, lead to reordering of circuitry that would allow for better thinking, better mood, many of the same things that you've observed in the clinical trials for depression. So the rationale is really strong. I think that's a very exciting area. I get asked all the time about TBI, and traumatic brain injury, and right now, it's kind of, there isn't a whole lot that people can do, and people are dabbling in the space of hyperbaric chambers, and people will do sauna and breath work, and people are kind of clipping at the margins of what really is a problem that resides deep to the skull. So I think, I just want to applaud the exploration. I think it's great, provided that exploration is being done in a controlled way. It sounds like that's what you're doing with the UFC? - Yeah, so that's- - A great- - They were really gracious, and had myself and a few of my colleagues out to their headquarters in Vegas, and- - Impressive place, right? - It's in process. - Yeah. - You know, there's a dialogue going on there. I'm hopeful that there's going to be some work with them. But it's in process now, in terms of exploring it. There's a real interest, and I'm just really impressed by the organization and their commitment - Yeah. - to athlete health, and we'll see. - I am too. Yeah, I am too. We have a colleague out there. We're doing a little bit of work with them. Dunkin French, who's a serious academic in his own right. And I think when people hear UFC, they just think about the octagon, and fighting, and Pay-per-view fights, and things. But in talking with them, and I'm sure you've had these discussions as well, they are very much interested in the health and longevity of their fighters. They are also interested in the health and longevity of their fighters being a template for how to treat traumatic brain injury, and improve human performance in other sports, and in the general public. And I think it's not an image of the UFC that commonly comes to mind, 'cause they haven't been particularly verbal about it in the press. But I think it's great they're bringing in academics. I mean, geeks like us going out to the UFC Performance center. I mean, you do MMA, but I'm basically just a geek walking through the place. But the fact that they're interested in talking to scientists is really, I'm biased here, but a point in their favor. Along the lines of other groups and individuals that have impacted the space that you're working in in this pioneering"}
{"question": "Will I be able to have a controlled AI version of myself that can accurately answer questions about my interests and expertise, and how will I be able to ensure that this AI version represents me accurately?", "doc_id": "1Wo6SqLNmLk_23", "video_id": "1Wo6SqLNmLk", "video_title": "Mark Zuckerberg & Dr. Priscilla Chan: Curing All Human Diseases & the Future of Health & Technology", "video_header": "AI Assistants & Creators, Identity Protection", "segment_idx": "23", "time_start": "2:06:42", "time_end": "2:13:21", "context": "What's happening with and what can we expect around AI interfaces and maybe even avatars of people within social media? Are we not far off from a day where there are multiple versions of me and you on the internet or people? For instance, I get asked a lot of questions. I don't have the opportunity to respond to all those questions. But with things like ChatGPT, people are trying to generate answers to those questions on other platforms. Will I have the opportunity to soon have an AI version of myself where people can ask me questions about what I recommend for sleep and circadian rhythm, fitness, mental health, et cetera based on content I've already generated that will be accurate so they could just ask my avatar? MARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah, this is something that I think a lot of creators are going to want that we're trying to build and I think we'll probably have a version of next year. But there's a bunch of constraints that I think we need to make sure that we get right. So for one, I think it's really important that-- it's not that there's a bunch of versions of you. It's that if anyone is creating an AI assistant version of you, it should be something that you control. I think there are some platforms that are out there today that just let people like make-- I don't know-- an AI bought of me or other figures. And it's like, I don't know. I mean, we have platform policies for-- and for decades, since the beginning of the company at this point, which is almost 20 years, that basically don't allow impersonation. Real identity is like one of the core aspects that our company was started on. You want to authentically be yourself. So yeah, I think if you're almost any creator, being able to engage your community-- and there's just going to be more demand to interact with you than you have hours in the day. So there are both people who out there who would benefit from being able to talk to an AI version of you. And I think you, and other creators, would benefit from being able to keep your community engaged and service that demand that people have to engage with you. But you're going to want to know that that AI version of you or assistant is going to represent you the way that you would want. And there are a lot of things that are awesome about these modern LLMs. But having perfect predictability about how it's going to represent something is not one of the current strengths. So I think that there's some work that needs to get done there. I don't think it needs to be 100% perfect all the time. But you need to have very good confidence, I would say, that it's going to represent you the way that you'd want for you to want to turn it on, which, again, you should have control over whether you turn it on. So we wanted to start in a different place, which I think is a somewhat easier problem, which is creating new characters for AI personas. So that way, it's not-- we built one of the AIs is like a chef. And they can help you come up with things that you could cook and can help you cook them. There's a couple of people that are interested in different types of fitness that can help you plan out your workouts or help with recovery or different things like that. There's an AI that's focused on DIY crafts. There's somebody who's a travel expert that can help you make travel plans or give you ideas. But the key thing about all of these is they're not modeled off of existing people. So they don't have to have 100% fidelity to making sure that they never say something that a real person who they're modeled after would never say because they're just made up characters. So I think that that's a somewhat easier problem. And we actually got a bunch of different well-known people to play those characters because we thought that would make it more fun. So there's like Snoop Dogg is the dungeon master. So you can drop him into a thread and play text-based games. And I do this with my daughter when I tuck her in at night. And she just loves storytelling. And it's like Snoop Dogg, as the dungeon master, will come up with here's what's happening next. And she's like, OK, I turn into a mermaid. And then I like swim across the bay. And I go and find the treasure chest and unlock it. And it's like, and then Snoop Dogg just always will have a next version of the-- a next iteration on the story. So I mean, it's stuff that's fun. But it's not actually Snoop Dogg. He's just the actor who's playing the dungeon master, which makes it more fun. So I think that's probably the right place to start, is you can build versions of these characters that people can interact with doing different things. But I think where you want to get over time is to the place where any creator or any small business can very easily just create an AI assistant that can represent them and interact with your community or customers, if you're a business, and basically just help you grow your enterprise. So I think that's going to be cool. It's a long-term project. I think we'll have more progress on it to report on next year. But I think that's coming. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm super excited about it because we hear a lot about the downsides of AI. I mean, I think people are now coming around to the reality that AI is neither good nor bad. It can be used for good or bad. And there are a lot of life-enhancing spaces that it's going to show up and really, really improve the way that we engage socially, what we learn, and that mental health and physical health don't have to suffer and, in fact, can be enhanced by the sorts of technologies we've been talking about. So I know you're extremely busy. I so appreciate the large amount of time you've given me today to sort through all these things. MARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah, it's been fun. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And to talk with you and Priscilla and to hear what's happening and where things are headed, the future certainly is bright. I share in your optimism. And it's been only strengthened by today's conversation. So thank you so much. And keep doing what you're doing. And on behalf of myself and everyone listening, thank you because, regardless of what people say, we all use these platforms excitedly. And it's clear that there's a ton of intention, and care, and thought about what could be in the positive sense. And that's really worth highlighting. MARK ZUCKERBERG: Awesome, thank you. I appreciate it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Thank you for joining me"}
{"question": "What are the recommended temperature ranges and duration for sauna exposure to experience its health benefits, and how can individuals determine their optimal heat tolerance?", "doc_id": "EQ3GjpGq5Y8_7", "video_id": "EQ3GjpGq5Y8", "video_title": "The Science & Health Benefits of Deliberate Heat Exposure | Huberman Lab Podcast #69", "video_header": "Protocols & Benefits of Deliberate Heat Exposure", "segment_idx": "7", "time_start": "26:32", "time_end": "33:34", "context": "of deliberate heat exposure, including sauna, but other tools as well, as a way to understand how heat and heating changes our biology. So, you're going to learn some mechanism and you're going to learn some tools. But first I'd like to just emphasize that the use of deliberate heat exposure can be a very powerful way to improve health and longevity. There's a wonderful study on this that was published in 2018 that includes a lot of data from a lot of participants, in a lot of different conditions, for instance, people that only did sauna once versus two to three times a week versus four to seven times a week and so on, and compares all those. The title of the study is Sauna Bathing is Associated With Reduced Cardiovascular Mortality and Improves Risk Prediction in Men and Women a Prospective Cohort Study. This is one of several papers that clearly demonstrate that regular use of sauna or other forms of deliberate heat exposure can reduce mortality to cardiovascular events, but also to other events, things like stroke and other things that basically can kill us. What I like so much about this and the related studies, and yes, I will provide a link to these in the show notes, is that they involve a lot of participants. So for instance, in this particular paper, which was published in BMC Medicine, they looked at a sample of 1,688 participants who had a mean age of 63, but there was a range of ages around 63, and of whom 51.4% were women. The rest were men. So it's a pretty nicely varied study in terms of the populations that they looked at. And basically what they found was the more often that people do sauna, the better their health is and the lower the likelihood they will die from some sort of cardiovascular event. What do we mean by sauna? We need to define some of the parameters around sauna, and I promise to provide you some alternative ways to access some of the health benefits that were observed in this and related studies without the need to have a sauna, 'cause I do realize that a lot of people don't have access to sauna. First off, the temperature ranges that were used in this and pretty much all the studies that I'm going to talk about, unless I say otherwise, are between 80 degrees Celsius, meaning 176 degrees Fahrenheit, and 100 degrees Celsius, meaning 212 degrees Fahrenheit. So somewhere in that range. How hot should you make the sauna or the environment that you get into should you decide to use these tools? Well, that will depend on your tolerance for heat, how heat adapted you are. Yes, some people are better at sweating than others. And over time we all get better at sweating. Meaning if you go into the sauna more frequently, you become a better sweater, not sweater you wear, but the verb sweater, you get better at sweating, at dumping heat through the loss of water. So it's going to depend. I recommend starting on the lower end of the temperature scale, and if that's too hot for you that you even lower the temperature further. Now, how long were people exposing themselves to these hot environments? Anywhere from five to 20 minutes per session. And as you'll soon learn, very brief periods of just five minutes of heat exposure can be a powerful stimulus if the heat exposure is significantly great enough for you. 20 minutes can also be beneficial, but 80 to 100 degrees Celsius, meaning 176 degrees Fahrenheit to 212 degrees Fahrenheit is the general range that this and most studies use. In this particular study, they compared the effects of people that did sauna once a week, two or three times per week, or four to seven times per week. And what they saw was really remarkable. What they observed was that people who went into the sauna two or three times per week were 27% less likely to die of a cardiovascular event than people that went into the sauna just once a week, again at the temperature levels and the duration that I talked about earlier. And as you can imagine, the duration, the temperature levels were related. So if people went into very hot environments that were really uncomfortable for them, maybe they only went in for five minutes. Whereas, if they were more comfortable and heat adapted in a given environment or their tolerance for heat was just simply higher for whatever reason, well then they tended to stay in longer. We can take a sort of average of this five to 20 minute range, and today we're mainly going to talk about exposures between 10 and 20 minutes at temperatures between, again, 80 degrees and 100 degrees Celsius, 176 degrees Fahrenheit, or 212 degrees Fahrenheit. So these data point to the fact that going in the sauna two or three times per week is really beneficial and can lower mortality to cardiovascular events. And in fact, the benefits were even greater for people that we're going into the sauna four to seven times per week. Those people were 50% less likely to die of a cardiovascular event compared to people that went into the sauna just once a week. So these are really impressive, and frankly, encouraging studies. Certainly they caught my eye and encouraged me to start using deliberate heat exposure on a regular basis. What's particularly nice about this study, and the related study that, again, is linked in the show notes, is that they looked at a number of potentially confounding variables, things like whether or not people smoked, things like whether or not people were overweight, whether or not they tended to exercise or not exercise, and they were able to separate out those variables. So the percentages that I described earlier, 27% less likely to die of a cardiovascular event for those that went in the sauna two to three times a week and 50% less likely to die of a cardiovascular event for those that went into the sauna four times per week, as compared to just once a week. Those effects really do seem to be the consequence of the sauna exposure and not some other effect that's correlated with sauna exposure, like going to the gym where people are working out seven times a week and then also happen to get into the sauna, or quitting smoking right about the same time they adopt a sauna protocol, these sorts of things. And now there have been additional analyses of the use of sauna for improving health, or I should say for offsetting mortality, that have found that it's not just reductions in cardiovascular events, but so called all-cause mortality. This is kind of medical geek speak for saying, how likely are you or somebody to die from a cardiovascular event, but maybe be also from some other event, some other health-related event, like cancer or something of that sort. And in every case, regular exposure to sauna starting at about two or three times per week, all the way up to seven times per week, greatly improves, meaning statistically significant improvements in longevity in the sense that people are less likely to die of cardiovascular events and other things that kill us. So I and many other people who are interested not just in our own health, but in educating about health-related tools to the general public, find this really exciting. But knowing what we know about how heat impacts our biology,"}

But sometimes, no. And as we've established, there is always, always tremendous value to exploring these cupboards. So how does one go about exploring the different cupboards under the function of self? And we should probably start that conversation by saying, what are the cupboards under the function of self? Paul Conti: I'll start off by saying all the cupboards under the function of self will reference the structure of self, which makes sense. There's a structure, and the function arises from the structure. It's good for us to have that in mind as we're thinking about the elements of the function of self. So the deepest element, let's say the bottom of the pillar, is self- awareness, right? The sense of an I on top of that. Next up the pillar are defense mechanisms in action. Up from that is salience. What we're paying attention to inside and out. The next level above that is behavior, and on top of that is our strivings. So if we go back to the bottom layer, the deepest, most complicated layer, it's the sense of self- awareness, the sense of an I. And there are a lot of ways that we can foster self- awareness. So, like the unconscious mind in the structure, we can't just go there and fully understand what the I is, but we can do things that can really, really help us. So for me, thinking about what am I, and how am I navigating the world and having in mind the structure of self, like, right, there's an unconscious mind working its way in me. There's my conscious mind. Even being aware of the first pillar can be part of fostering the self- awareness of the second pillar. Another way that can happen is self- reflection. For some people, it can happen in meditation, contemplation of the self. There are many ways that we can help ourselves understand that living is an active process. That idea of the luge of time and we're moving down it, it's an active process, and that is the I that I'm guiding through that process. We can foster self- awareness in a number of ways, but what we're trying to do here, the same as with the bottom of the structure of self, pillar the most complicated parts. There's a lot that's unconscious. There's a lot that's unknown to us. So what we're trying to do is know some of it and know more of it over time. Bring some of those automatic or unconscious things to conscious awareness so that we can have a better understanding. Because if we have an understanding, we can utilize that to make everything better. Andrew Huberman: I can see right off how this first cupboard of self- awareness and"}

So that's a kind of interesting aspect of running. If you're a fan of running, which I am, and you get the chance to look at any of the documentaries or docu-drama has made about, excuse me, about Steve Prefontaine. It was clear that he was mostly in a battle with himself, but that he was also a highly competitive individual. And you'll see this in some of his races. I do encourage you to look some of those up on YouTube or see the docudramas. They're quite good. Where he ran the... Essentially was 12 laps on a track. It's essentially the five. It is the 5,000 meter race where essentially three miles. And he essentially tried to sprint the whole thing which is ridiculous. Actually knowing what you know today you'll realize that Steve Prefontaine basically was pulling from strength, speed, power, muscular, endurance, long duration effort, high intensity, aerobic, anaerobic as he sort of tried to maximize every fuel system. And you'll see that in the races that he runs, but that when runners are nearing the final laps, the so-called bell lap of a race, they'll often look to one another to see where somebody is obviously to assess their progress and how close somebody is? But when somebody gets past, oftentimes you'll see someone access this mysterious kick, this ability to tap into some additional gear that allows them to run forward or faster when they themselves actually thought that they were maxed out. So someone could be running for the finish line. They're convinced they're going to win. They're going max effort or at least they perceive max effort. Someone passes them. And all of a sudden max effort has changed, because of that visual target they are able to access higher levels of speed and output and effort and performance. They don't always catch up to that person and win, but having a target a milestone is a powerful way that we can generate more force and energy in anything. And the visual system is the way that we bring those milestones into our brain, which then brings about epinephrin, which brings about neural firing, which allows us to access whatever resources happen to be available to us. So I find this fascinating because people often wonder, like where does the kick come from? Where is this kind of gift of an additional gear? Where is that deeper resource? And we often express it and talk about it, in kind of psychological terms like heart or willpower or that something kind of got transplanted into us or descended into us. And not to remove any of the spiritual aspects of sport or running or effort of the human, you know, heart. But it's very clear that the nervous system when it has a specific visual target can generate the sorts of intense effort"}

the kid says I hate you m now earlier you said that good boundaries are about not expecting a change in behavior from someone else they about our own boundaries so um or maybe the I hate you comes from you know listen we're not going to go to so and so's house for a play date today great example I hate you yeah I hate you um so is there ever a case for no response I mean to me the most underutilized parenting strategy is doing nothing literally it's one of my most used strategies because and there's there's there's like really good reason for it especially in this situation so I always to me like I always say we have to understand before we intervene so I know every parent like what do you do in that situation but it's like trying like it's like trying to fix someone's tennis swing before you like look at their tennis swing right like what there could be a lot of problems so again why is a kid saying I hate you and I would ask every parent to just keep this in mind it's a tool and you can't use it in real time eventually you can but we have to say it at like the end of a night when my kid said I hate you what what is my most generous interpretation of why he would say that to me and if you're like any human me included by the way like your least generous interpretation is immediate you're like because he's a sociopath like that's what we say all the time we're like wow or because he's like a horrible kid because he's spoiled because he's nasty it comes easily so that's fine but what is my most generous interpretation and when I don't know I'll push myself to say okay well like I was in a situation with my husband what would lead me to say that I what would lead you to say that to someone that I hate them yeah like they like say something to you like hey Andrew we're not going to be able to you know do this dinner it would have to be some sort of deep betrayal of trust and and when I'm and I have to acknowledge that if I said that to somebody that I really care about or love if as I'm saying I hate you what I'm really saying is I love you so much and that hurt unbelievably at such an unbelievable intensity that what's coming out of my mou say I hate you because if you because if you didn't love them that's right it would have null effect it would be a me it would be it would be a it would be a met but instead it's a oh it hurts so we somehow there's a neural circuit in there that goes you know I whatever insert explicative hate you that's right but what you're really saying is I love you so much yeah and as a consequence that thing you did or said hurts so much that's right and so I think that's like exactly what's going on for a kid or like to me my most generous interpretation in a simple way is my kid when I said we couldn't go to this friend's house that he thought we were going to his friend he was going to sleep over he had like so built it up in his mind he'd like probably like kids do like they have this whole image oh and then we're going to do this and this and like the let down was so intense and again I go back to kids have all the feelings we have and they're born with none of the skills so it takes a lot of it takes like a pretty welldeveloped skill to be really disappointed by the way and surprised right in the moment and like manage it in like a mature way I I'm sure we both know adults who aren't really capable of doing that right so the fact that my seven-year-old is doing that so if I think about it that way we latch on to our kids words as if they're the truth they're not the truth it's not to say they don't matter but they're not the truth the truth is whatever world is under the words like I'm disappointed and I don't know how to manage that so if I think about the outcome like what would where do I want to be what I would love in that situation because the truth is when I say to my kid sorry we can't go to Bobby's house I wouldn't even want it's not normal for my kid to be like oh no problem because like I would I'm just picturing my 25-year-old like trying to get a job and being like Mom oh I didn't get it and then he's like no problem I'm like that's kind of weird like really like that's weird like I'd want you to be disappointed and so what I want my kid to be able to do is to be like I don't know what's the best to gets like oh man I was really looking forward to that that's like ultimate maturity so how do I get from I hate you to oh man I was really like you know looking forward to that the all the things we want to do just like don't even make sense like sending my kid to their room saying like you're such a nasty kid I've never seen any of your friends say that to their parents and I'm good at acting these things out because of course I say these things too but all I'm doing is basically telling my kid the version of themselves I don't want them to be so now I'm further away from that outcome just not effective my kid obviously literally needs to learn some of those skills and practice them we don't think about simulations with kids nearly enough we know that in sports people practice all the time we don't do that with emotion regulation so what do I do in the moment I think the best question here is what do I do outside the moment to help my kid build the skills so they actually have more of a skill the next time that moment comes still I'm a pragmatist what do I do in the moment I hate you I probably would do nothing first when someone is rude to you and they say something nasty I don't know I just like this is one this is my son this is me my son just hurled I hate you it's like sitting between us when we say back to them like you know I hate you or like go to your room we take all the energy from what they said and we just like throw it and then like we have this pingpong match when you do nothing I always picture if this is like that I hate you it just sits between us my kid has a much higher chance of kind of reing what they just said because I'm just kind of sturdy in that moment because I didn't just take it from them and say something to them which just gives them the opportunity to like take what I said and have no responsibility for the first thing they said it's always true in adults when someone says to you like something nasty if you actually just stay there they're kind of like oh shoot like I shouldn't have said that because like it's it's right there so I'd probably say nothing no a couple I don't know if I'd really do that but I'd want to do that let me be clear something else you can say and moment which takes a lot of presence so it's not going to happen right away is just something like Whoa like clearly you're disappointed I get that I believe you and I know there's another way you can say that to me that's actually right back to family jobs I'm validating and I'm setting kind of a boundary in some ways like I know maybe there's a hope there too like I know there's another way if my kid keeps saying I hate you I hate you you're the worst you're the worst I'm going to say listen I love you you're a good kid you're you're having a hard time I I really won't stay in your room while you keep saying this to me and part of that is cuz it's not good for you either like this isn't a good Dynamic I'm going to step outside I'm going to come back and we can talk about it when we're both in a place where we can be a little more respectful or something like that right you don't have to be a punching bag but at least now I'm helping my kid see that he is having a feeling under these words if I can't differentiate the feeling from the behavior how can I expect my kid to ever learn to differentiate those two which is how my kid can actually get to a more regulated place I've sometimes wondered"}
{"question": "What are some common supplements that can help improve mental health, physical health, and performance, and how do they interact with nutrition and behavioral tools?", "doc_id": "tLS6t3FVOTI_1", "video_id": "tLS6t3FVOTI", "video_title": "Developing a Rational Approach to Supplementation for Health & Performance | Huberman Lab Podcast", "video_header": "Hierarchy of Tools/Interventions, Developing a Supplementation Protocol", "segment_idx": "1", "time_start": "3:40", "time_end": "11:49", "context": "something very important not just as it relates to supplements but as it relates to all aspects of mental health physical health and performance and that is I take the stance that behavioral tools that is specific actions that we take and specific actions that we avoid form the foundation of mental health physical health and performance so things like viewing morning sunlight and exercise are behavioral tools they don't require the ingestion of anything within the realm of Behavioral tools there are also some don'ts or do not that can greatly enhance our mental health physical health and performance such as avoiding bright light exposure to your eyes between the hours of 10 pm and 4 AM or avoiding caffeine too late in the afternoon because even if you can fall asleep after ingesting caffeine in the late afternoon we know it disrupts the architecture of your sleep in ways that greatly diminish your mental health physical health and performance the following day for instance so behavioral tools form the foundational layer of all tools for mental health physical health and performance second to that I would say the next layer is in fact nutrition no amount of supplementation or non-prescription compounds or prescription compounds for that matter can never compensate for poor nutrition at least not for very long okay so this is a key Point even though many supplements are not simply food supplements because they are not designed to compensate for anything that you could otherwise get from food that is not to say that you can live on supplements you know I suppose you could live on whey protein and fish oil capsules and vitamin capsules or tablets for a short while but before long you'd either suffer from boredom to the extent that you'd want to go back to food or some other deficiency would show up I think it's the rare individual that tries to survive entirely on food supplements and things of that sort most everybody and I would hope everybody is paying attention to their nutrition so I would Place behavioral tools do's and do Nots as layer one the deepest layer the Bedrock of all mental health physical health and performance on top of that I would Place nutrition and of course that's going to mean different things to different people with the understanding that there's a huge array of different food choices and nutritional programs nutrition is fundamentally important for macronutrients for storage of energy in the form of glycogen fats and phosphocratine stores and so forth but also for obtaining basic nutrients vitamins minerals and micronutrients Okay so we've got behavioral tools nutritional tools then on top of that I would place what is typically called supplementation although today I'm trying to expand that word to include not just things that compensate for food deficiencies or that are layered on top of food as a way to enhance the amount of nutrients that you could get from food but as I mentioned before compounds that are non-prescription that can be for a variety of different purposes and many of which are not available in food so I would place supplementation right on top of nutrition then past that I would say prescription drugs obviously prescribed from a board-certified MD can serve a very vital purpose in the treatment or augmentation of mental health physical health and performance goals so some people do in fact need prescription antidepressants other people do not some people do in fact need prescription drugs for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or sleep Related Disorders so on and so forth the whole issue of whether or not there is an over prescription epidemic or not um is a separate conversation for a separate podcast I would argue that many prescription drugs do in fact save lives this includes the category of prescription drugs related to statins and cardiovascular health related to any number of different things even sleep disorders and insomnia narcolepsy and so forth that said there are many instances in which people can either reduce their dosages of prescription compounds or can replace those prescription compounds with quality behavioral tools nutrition and supplementation but there are many instances in which prescription drugs are the only route by which people can achieve the mental health physical health and performance goals that they wish to achieve so I would place that as the fourth layer in this stack of layers directed towards mental health physical health and performance so just to list off again I fundamentally believe that behaviors do's and do Nots form the foundation of mental health physical health performance and next in line would be nutrition that is the specific Foods we eat the amount that we eat the combinations of foods that we eat in a given sitting and the timing in which we eat our food then on top of that I would Place supplementation the topic of today's episode and finally prescription drugs and of course all of these things interact in important and interesting ways many of which interactions we will discuss during today's podcast as we drill into the topic of supplementation developing a rational supplementation protocol and one that is most biologically and cost effective before moving further into today's episode I want to emphasize a very important point which is that I am not a physician that is I'm not a clinician so I do not prescribe anything nor am I going to do that today I'm a professor I review the research literature I describe tools gleaned from the research literature and developed from the research literature so I profess many things but I do not prescribe anything and I think it's vitally important that anytime you are thinking of adding or subtracting any behavioral protocols nutritional protocols supplementation based protocols and certainly prescription drug based protocols for whatever purpose that you consult a trusted board-certified physician that's absolutely essential I don't say that merely to protect me I mainly say that to protect you the most important aspect of today's episode is not going to be that you discover one particular supplement or category of supplements or blend of supplements that is going to transform your mental health physical health and performance no the purpose of today's episode is for you to understand where you have needs that can be met by supplementation better than any other approach and most importantly how to think about supplementation that is how to think about the different categories of supplements that are out there and how those interact with your nutrition and your behaviors so that you can maximize your immediate and long-term health what I mean by this is that we have this word supplements or supplementation but that means many many different things it means vitamins it means minerals it means adaptogens most people probably don't even know what an adaptogen really is and in fact many people talking about adaptogens never actually Define what an adaptogen is or designed for or the fact that many adaptogens are also used for other purposes so today's discussion is really about you learning how to think about supplementation the same way you would learn to think about nutrition or exercise or anything related to brain and body health for that matter in a way that lets you navigate this vast space that we call supplementation and develop protocols that are optimal for you and indeed it may be the case that the ideal dosage of a given supplement for you is zero milligrams for instance if I ask you are you sleeping deeply and enough each night do you feel rested throughout the day maybe you need a short nap and that's it or maybe you don't and you say yes I feel great I sleep great I wake up feeling great I only need a short nap or no nap during the day to feel rested throughout the day well then there's really no discussion about sleep supplementation to be had between you and me however if you are not sleeping well then a big discussion opens up as to what the reasons are as it relate to nutrition or when you're exercising or ingesting caffeine in other words no discussion about supplementation can be had in a vacuum rather discussions about supplementation need to be considered in a larger context so today you're going to learn how to place the discussion and thinking about supplementation in a larger context and think about how specific supplements that is specific ingredients and combinations of ingredients can indeed be used to buffer and support your overall health and lead you to specific health and performance outcomes before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my"}

just call it longer path um thinking and decision- making look I I I think it's the the fracturing of the institutions that have been with us the past several hundred years that is leading to uh an exponential rise in short-term Behavior okay so you mentioned religion uh maybe for a moment we could just talk about universities yeah these days in part because of the distrust of Science and in part because of the distrust of in government and in part because of the distrust in traditional media um there's more and more uh ideas being kicked around that you know formal education is not as valuable as it used to be and people always cite the examples of the Mark Zuckerberg's and uh others who didn't finish college but I would argue they got in and chose to leave they took leave of absence they didn't drop out and they are rare individuals Ryan holiday said it best I think if you are struggling in college you're absolutely the kind of person that needs to stay in college um with rare exception unless there's like a mental health issue or some a physical health issue that needs to be tended to because nowhere else in life except perhaps the military is there such a clear designated set of steps that take you from um you know point A to point B with a credential that you can leverage in the real world for for builds um and I completely agree with that but I would also argue that academic institutions and financial institutions have changed political institutions have changed and there's a there's a deep distrust so we we are having a harder time relying on them to make good decisions I you saw a lot of presidents of University major universities fired recently um including Stanford there I said it it happened um but also Harvard and other places for different reasons and and fired might be not the correct term they decide to resign whatever it was they're no longer there they have new ones in um and so there's a lot of distrust so what can we rely on like if it's not if if people are having less faith in religion less faith in academic institutions less faith in like what do we got we got really good in academ at least on the social sciences side of saying what was wrong with the systems but not about what the systems we wanted them to be because going back several hundred years ago coming you know through the Enlighten especially well Renaissance into the enlightenment the enlightenment gave us back this idea of a new meta narrative based on on on rationality and logos and and the ability to kind of understand the World by breaking it down into its component parts of that science um fast forward several hundred years and we're at the point now where we're really good at saying what doesn't work but very very bad about saying what does work and what we do want because by saying what we do want means that we have to put forth some sort of meta narrative some thread some official future that we can hang ourselves on and it tells us a lot about it's sort of like Declaration of values it's one thing to say um which is scary uh for a lot of people because it's one thing to say that doesn't work that's no good that's no good it's easy to be a Critic what you're describing has incredible par to what to health like you know when I started the podcast and even before when I was posting on social media it was during the lockdowns and it was like all this fear about everything and I said listen like I I can't solve this larger issue related to what may or may not be going on but what's obvious people are stressed stress is bad when it's chronic people aren't sleeping that's bad especially when it's chronic and I've got some some potential Solutions some tools some zero cost tools so a lot of the the backbone of the hubman Lab podcast is about the things you do more so than the things you don't do so what you're describing is essentially a field that consists of like breaking things down but isn't offering Solutions so it sounds very similar and I think that um people love potential Solutions even if one acknowledges look this might not solve every sleep issue it very well could make you know positive ground towards some of it or make it 50% better 20% better in some cases 100% better and of course there are those For Whom the the tools don't work and they need to go to through more to more Extreme Measures but um I hear you saying that religion provided the solutions not just pointing to problems people are not looking at that as much anymore the uh big institutions like AC academic institutions political institutions let's face it regardless of where one sits on one side of the aisle or the other they're constantly fighting it's like 12- hour news cycle designed you just point fingers so that nobody actually has to say what they really believe in a clear tangible way there are those that do that a bit more than others but it's it's a it's a mess and then in terms of the family unit this is what I was alluding to before I feel like family units and values and structures are becoming more rare at least in the traditional view of the family um let let let's remember two parents kids Etc which is not by no means a requirement to call something a family but so like where so are you saying that we all have to look as like it obviously starts with the individual but that every that part of the work of being a human being now in going forward is to learn this Futures approach we have to be future conscious we but again this goes back to the transgenerational component we have to critically assess where we came from and why we're at this point so we talk let's talk about the nuclear family let's um the idea that your children would be quote unquote sleep trained and put into another room is relatively new that's from the Victorian era right where you would put your kids in another room because if you go back to most indigenous cultures everyone together and this happened for thousands of years and the kids pile yeah or in one big room or or in a long house huh I don't know if they were like piglets but they definitely all s together look the the my and look everyone can look I'm going to say this in a non-judgmental way but it's going to sound very judgmental I walk down the street sometimes and I see kids in strollers being pushed by a seemingly healthy adult right the kid is detached and they're in this kind of this buggy which comes from 17 18th century England but if you look at most cultures around the world for thousands of years what they did was they wore their babies for what we call the fourth trimester usually the mother so a bunch of patriarchal reasons for that but they literally would have a wrap on and the baby would be wrapped and be held very close to them this is the baby beorn thing well the baby beorn you put the baby on front of you but it's facing out when you really wrap them with like a 20 yard WP it's skin to skin right and and and look and there's a reason like like everything there's a reason for everything you know B for for a human baby to come out of the mother as cognitively intellectually and physically ready as a baby chimpanzee would take 18 months of gestation but we only do nine you know why right we we do it because our brains got so big because of all that protein because of AR and Andy were hunting together using our prospection earlier on this story that the baby has to come out at 9 months because when we from walking on all fours to being bipedal the female pelvis closes and there's only so much room for that baby to come out so they come out early yeah the brain had completed development internally the you'd have only stillborn I mean presumably there was a branch of our earlier version of species that many mothers and and uh babies died in child birth because of this they were deselected but that's not the we found we found the optimal balance of 9 months roughly right but what that means is the baby has to be attached and close to the because it's totally helpless um the point is that so much of what we do we don't critically examine so you're talking about you know the breakdown of the family structure I would argue that breakdown isn't happening now that breakdown happened when we decided to move from you know tribes and clans of raising children and move into a Victorian area mindset where we we take the grandparent you know there there's very few species on planet Earth that after the female um goes through menopause they still live basically elephants whales and humans right why because those are the species where you need others Elders to help care for the young because of the a for mentioned early early uh birthing but maybe it's also the the propagation of of story as you said earlier that can inform better decisions so we we need stories wisdom is like spoken cave paintings basically yeah and so we need so those stories about what does it mean to have a proper family structure as you know whether it's a nuclear family of four or five 20 of aunts and uncles and around look we did pretty well for the first couple hundred thousand years and then there was all these things that religion disrupted right taking the children away from the mom these all come from puritanical beliefs now we're at this point in this intertitle moment where we have to critically examine why is it we do what we do what are the things that we want to keep and what are the things we want to let go of and how do we move forward and your question was well why do they want to do that what is it what is it what's the incentive structure and I'm arguing that the incentive structure for us to do that because because we actually care about where we take our species where we move forward in the universe given the fact that so much had to go right to get us to this point right I'm I'm often asked this question you know um God how do we how do we get so messed up and what is it going to look like wait are are we so messed up because you said we're about a third of the way through our our things are better than yeah so I get I get the I get the question like how is it that we messed up and I always say we didn't mess up we're actually doing much better look I I walk into my daughter's room and I look at their bookshelf 15-year-old twin daughters and every piece of fiction that takes place somewhat in the future is dystopian all the Futures they know are the Hunger Games are the hund are the Maze Runner a world that has gone bad um I understand the we talked about this earlier that's the negativity bias people going to be attracted to reading about those things kids read that stuff now oh my those are the best sellers the best sellers are all the these dystopian there's always a love interest in a teenage thing but it's always the backdrop is always dystopia and we're attracted to that in the same way we're attracted to a dumpster fire because we want to see the things that dystopias can act as dystopian stories can act as an early warning system if you keep doing this one thing that you're doing and extrapolate out a few decades it'll look like this what we're missing and you just you hit the nail on the head are the stories about what if we get it right what what we call protopia so you know you Utopia is this perfect world that always collapses on itself it's really dystopia a size dystopia we talked about is a terrible terrible World a protopia this idea put forth by Kevin Kelly is a better tomorrow not perfect but one we're making progress so it's unbelievably important and this is how I'm answering your question from a few minutes ago that we start setting stories in protopia in better tomorrow in tomorrows where not everything is perfect but where we have made significant progress now it won't be perfect there'll still be divorces and maybe murders and Mayhem but if we start"}

{"question": "How much of the total calories from a 1600 calorie Porter House steak, including fat, actually contribute to the body's energy burn versus being used for thermogenesis and other non-energy related processes?", "doc_id": "n28W4AmvMDE_3", "video_id": "n28W4AmvMDE", "video_title": "Dr. Robert Lustig: How Sugar & Processed Foods Impact Your Health", "video_header": "Calories, Protein & Fat, Trans Fats", "segment_idx": "3", "time_start": "12:17", "time_end": "18:17", "context": "acids so we all eat protein let's say you eat too much protein yeah you know the Porter House steak all right now if you're a bodybuilder those amino acids might go to muscle and you might increase your muscle mass because you're a bodybuilder because you're putting uh excess uh force on those muscles and you're growing those muscles okay but let's say you're not a bodybuilder let's say you're a mmortal like me or let's say you're a kid going through puberty who's synthesizing a lot of muscle not because they're lifting weights because they're because testosterone's making it happen yeah absolutely but let's say you're not let's say you know you're just you know just schlump the the street like uh you know joeo okay and you eat that Porter House you've taken on all these amino acids there's no place to store it other than muscle so your liver takes the excess and deamidates that amino acid takes the amino group off to turn it from a amino acid into an organic acid and then that organic acid can then enter the kreb cycle the tricarboxylic acid cycle what goes on in the mitochondria in order to generate ATP the chemical energy that your body needs in order to power itself okay now that's a good thing it takes double the amount of energy to prepare that amino acid for burning as it does to uh prepare a carbohydrate for burning or fat because when I asked about when you asked about almonds why the the 160 versus 130 I thought it was the processing it turned out it was fiber you're saying for protein let's it let's make it realistic for a a really nice big porterhouse steak which I love by the way let's say let's say 800 calories yeah well it turns how how much of that is is uh so that's what goes in your mouth right my mouth right how much of it is actually um eaten in uh to stay with the your calorie eaten is not a calorie eaten in the processing of that what percentages actually goes into your total caloric intake right so about 10% of everything you eat goes to just maintaining body temperature it's called the thermic effect of food but when you're eating protein you actually generate more Heat and the reason is because it takes to ATP to phosphorate that organic acid as opposed to one ATP to uh phosphorate that carbohydrate for uh consumption so you actually have a net loss of energy because it was a an amino acid versus a monosaccharide a sugar now you you brought up fat fat doesn't need to be phosphorilated so it actually doesn't have any um thermic effective food at that point so depends on what it is as to whether or not you have loss okay so but in this um let's make it actually realistic a 1600 calorie uh Porter House with a nice slab of of uh of grass-fed butter on there I do this every once in a while not not often with some cream spinach and maybe some mushrooms along the side honestly I say when I'm eating a porter house I don't want to adulterate The Taste okay with anything else except maybe some some butter maybe a salad okay afterwards but but let's say 1600 calories of of it's got some fat in there for sure uh let's say um uh a thousand of those calories is protein mhm the other 600 are fat something like that something like that depending on how marbled it is okay so based on what you just said about the thermic effect of food and protein in particular of that thousand calories how much actually is can we count I'm not a calorie counter but does one include as calories truly ingested well if you ingested 1600 well that's what went in the mouth but but but what is is going to go against your your uh burn deficit right so I would have to actually do the math to figure that out but as a guess yeah back of the envelope back of the envelope calculation you're going to lose about 25% of that wow so we're talking 750 calories yeah you know so and to translate this a bit so what we're saying here is if you're somebody who is trying to lose weight or maintain weight or perhaps even gain weight you eat a 1 1600 calorie Porter House with a slab of butter on it 600 of those calories we're saying in this instance is fat of the remaining thousand calories that's that all in your mouth so you count it at your mouth right but 700 but then when you compare it against your energy burn for that day to maintain temperature brain activity physical activity really it's only 750 calories that's right that's a huge difference exactly and another reason why a calorie is not a calorie now let's take the third let's take fats so over here we have omega-3s heart healthy anti-inflammatory anti-alzheimer's save your life and over here we have trans fats the devil incarnate consumable poison because you can't break the trans double bond you don't have the desaturates to break that trans double bond so it basically accumulates lines your arteries lines your liver causes chronic metabolic disease causes insulin resistance Omega-3s don't even get broken down for energy because they're so important they stay intact because your brain needs them your heart needs them whereas

always obsessed with something growing up whether or not it was like birds and fish tanks or skateboard or prior to that soccer or you know um I mean certainly there were drugs and alcohol around but there was there were always activities that kept us busy um and I guess I wonder whether or not the Advent of social media has created less interest in activities I you know after school activities I guess they used to call them but um I mean even if it's video games um if it's playing a sport if it's theater if it's um art if it's music uh presumably kids are still doing all that stuff but is it the case that the kids that are vaping let's say nicotine maybe cannabis as well are less likely to be engaged in other activities I mean is this thing becoming just kind of a closed loop of reward I mean that that's to me the real danger of any substance that um increases the dopamine system activation without a lot of effort right because the as you and I know that the the whole of dopamine circuitry as it relates to reward is all about effort reward reinforcement effort reward reinforcement um but the effort piece is key and drugs basically bypass the effort piece and then you get the reward reinforcement and then eventually the rewarding and reinforcing levels of of return on that drug nicotine cannabis Etc diminishes and then you're just caught in a behavioral Loop right right right absolutely um so you know are kids doing less stuff are they are they studying less as a consequence of this are they are they playing fewer sports are they less engaged in youth theater and music and youth groups and things like that when we were talking about cigarettes when I first started my career up until probably 2014 I would say yes you're absolutely correct and it was generally the teens who would say I'm bored and I didn't know what to do with myself and that's why I picked up cigarettes or um or I'm not an athlete or or this was my social outlet I haven't seen that as a result as much with ecigarettes now as a result of ecigarettes yes but not as a cause of using because it's so ubiquitous ecigarettes we're seeing everywhere it doesn't matter if you're how old you are male female used to be more males using because some of the earlier devices were more Tech and guys were using it and some of the females didn't want to put them in their person because they would leak we now are seeing more of an equal if not a little bit more female using um it's it's not your so-called bad or good kids it's not anything it's not the young people who are struggling with school it's everywhere right now independent of location race ethnicity things like that so I don't see so much what you're talking about in terms of a predictor in terms of a of a result absolutely I mean then we're seeing teens who become more isolated who are not engaged as much who are more bored because they're sitting home and they're vaping um but I also see a lot of young people sitting around together vaping uh so I I do think that that landscape has changed um is it going to change back I don't know is hopefully we change the culture again uh but it it's an interesting thought I mean as soon as you said that I was thinking yeah I mean they're certainly not out as much as they used to be in terms of and we're talking about this at the beginning we're not seeing them out in Parks as much we're not seeing them playing pickup sports games as much as we used to but I don't think that's because of ecigarette use I think that's because of social media and just the whole change and honestly parents being afraid of letting their kids out for some predatory behavior and in other ways um and you mean if kids are let out of the house they're more at risk to predatory behavior but of course they're also at risk when but just by use of the phone because the phone connects everywhere absolutely the phone connects everywhere and that's something we try to teach teens as well but I think that that's been something that parents are worried about you know I have to you almost the pendulum almost swung too much of now I have to keep my kid in because I don't want to let them out of the house and I don't want to let them alone driving and alone at the park and things like that but I think that we've reduced you were talking earlier about autonomy we've reduced teens just autonomy and they they have to get into a little bit of trouble they have to jwalk they have to do I mean I'm not encouraging but you know but but we there's some natural amount of getting together and hanging out and being crazy at the park and playing and playing games and things like that and I think that has stopped or or slowed down a lot uh I I see it with with some people in my own Community I don't see as much just hanging out in the front yard and shooting the breeze and instead they're they're inside and they're on their phones and and stuff like that so could that be part of why we're seeing more ecigarette use possibly I just don't haven't I haven't seen the studies on it yeah perhaps that's a good segue into risky behaviors when I was a kid I mean the dumb stuff that we did um meaning dumb because it was dangerous to ourselves I mean I am not suggesting people do this kids please don't do this just don't but just the dumb stuff of you know jumping off roofs or between roofs um I'm not going to give any other uh any anecdotes just uh it's amazing that we all survived um and and some didn't but that was largely the consequence of drugs alcohol mental health issues of kids I knew um but car accidents um actually I grew up in the uh in the mother's Against Drunk Driving era and there was a there real discouragement around drunk driving I was fortunate that at least in high school most of my friends didn't drink or didn't drink much um but you still heard about fatalities kids happen um even one is is too many obviously um what's going on

brain facilitates learning and then of course people have to do something with that learning right so um do you make an effort to exercise for the specific purpose of maintaining or enhancing brain function yes yeah actually so I like when I finished my book I limped to the Finish Line I had all sorts of crazy stuff happen I won't depress the readers with all the crazy stuff sure people would be curious what what does it take to finish a book and how much you mean you took a toll on your body it took probably I mean matter I probably lost some like biological years in that but it was really like I mean it was great I mean it was really an emotional roller coaster though but then I had a bunch of you know I'm trying to do science write this book basically in my spare time which doesn't really exist as you know how it goes sure and then I had life happen you know my mom was in the hospital my cat died on my birthday I mean it was just like yeah see I didn't want to depress people with all this stuff it's real real life I'm just sorry to hear it yeah no no no it's okay so then I finished my book and uh I was like just thoroughly thrashed and I had a sabatical because I wanted to have time to promote the book and educate people about what's in the book and uh which I'd never gotten a chance to do before it's like doing this fantastic right I get to talk to people so um I really wanted to make some changes and actually this gets something we were talking about before we started recording which is after I wrote the book it's all you know it's going in the proofing stage uh I was talking my daughter and just you know out of the blue she said we're talking about ADHD and she's like Dad you totally have ADHD and I'm like what you know and I'm like oh gen Z you know overdiagnosis of ADHD whatever right and then I remembered when I was a kid my school contacted my parents and said you have ADHD he has ADHD and it was interesting because it was like I actually was ahead in school by a year and I got held back because I just was so socially bad I couldn't stop talking in class and I was just like really awkward and impulsive and uh um and so but the you know it was the 70s nobody did anything you know and and I had all sorts of behavior issues and so forth and there are other factors going on too but it really got me thinking oh my God I got to make some changes I'm living this unsustainable life where I'm jumping from crisis to crisis to crisis and say I don't have time for blah blah blah and so um my again it's going to sound depressing but it's got a happier ending so my dog had died in 2019 of cancer and that was my first dog and so I thought I'm never getting a dog again and uh in 2020 in the pandemic I got another dog because yeah and what kind of dog uh she's a both of these were shelter dogs so they're all mixes um I'm sure there's some pitol in her because that's every shelter dog either has pitol or um or Chihuahua exactly so but she's looks very Belgian malano and she moves like a Belgian malan beautiful dogs yeah and they're so smart and super athletic I mean she can like jump vertically you know just like it's so like which all come home she'll like jump up and then push herself off me which is like a very classic thing and so that's why they can jump like she can climb up like s feet up a tree to chase a squirrel yeah they use these for military operations in tier one military yeah yeah yeah jump out of planes with parachutes yeah yeah and she's but she's a smaller dog so our big our older dog looked like kind of she wasn't she was actually a kelpy mix I think but she looked like a um a Rottweiler and so everyone was scared of her even though she's the sweetest dog this one she's like smaller even though she looks kind of Shepherd likee everyone's like oh your dog is so sweet she's so cute you know you're like but this one's the ninja exactly yeah yeah um I mean all shelter dogs have a little bit of a crazy switch and them don't it's like it's it's tough for them they're they're like feral people feral dogs yeah but they have big hearts yeah they're eternally grateful you give them a home yeah yeah exactly and you know one of the things that I was thinking is I missed walking the dog I missed that activity and so I make sure to do that every morning and this is goes back to some of the activity things that we're talking about I know I'm totally drifting away from which is ironic no I see I see I see where you're going with this yeah so but this is this is is a little bit different but it's related which is um having a sense of purpose is very important for healthy brain aging there's a trends of cognitive science article can send you it's one of these things that neuroscientists don't talk about because it's not we don't understand it but it's hugely important it's part of this whole phenomenon what they call cognitive reserve and you know having this dog that I'm taking care of especially cuz you know my kid had gone to college just growing up living independently walking this dog every day it gives I mean obviously I'm married and I love my family and I've got lots I got love my students and so forth but it gave me more and I'm exercising in a way that's kind of fun I'm listening to podcasts and I'm moving and so that's something right there it's not just the exercise but it's the whole thing right I'm not doing something that I hate so then I'm like I hate running I hate I have this inertia because i' my ADHD brain doesn't like to do stuff unless it's shiny fun right I could go into work I could write this book cuz it's fun for me you know but so I'm like how can I do this and so I I ended up shelling out for a personal trainer I blow my advance on a personal trainer who's great and I go to see her and I she tells me what to do so I don't have to think about it and it's fun and you're in great shape you're a few years older than I am and I haven't seen you in a while and I I always have this like slight fear when I run into a colleague again after a while cuz there was this joke that we didn't tell professors until we became professors about the the so-called tenur look you see someone come in as a postto you see them as a junior professor and then you see them after tenure and tenure is a big milestone right it corresponds to academic freedom Etc it's a it's a wonderful Milestone it's a wonderful thing that we both have this um but you see some people who got tenure you just go oh goodness they look like they're you know aged 25 years in five years yeah we also see this with former presidents not all of them but a lot of them and um and so to run into you I well I saw you on Le freedman's podcast but then to see you I'm like Char's taking great care of himself it makes me happy it's not a judgment it's it's it makes me happy because I I love my colleagues and I want to see them live a very long time because I don't subscribe to the idea that science progresses uh one funeral time of my favorite scientists okay let's let's not attach that saying to me it was a joke I'm saying I'm saying that there's certain scientist my fellow scientists if you're out there anywhere don't H me there are certain scientists that you'd love to see live forever and you're one of them so um so you said walking the dog which

{"question": "What are some science-based strategies for training to achieve muscle growth, endurance, and strength, as well as preventing injuries and creating a lifelong fitness practice?", "doc_id": "UNCwdFxPtE8_0", "video_id": "UNCwdFxPtE8", "video_title": "Jeff Cavaliere: Optimize Your Exercise Program with Science-Based Tools | Huberman Lab Podcast #79", "video_header": "Jeff Cavaliere, Physical Training", "segment_idx": "0", "time_start": "0:00", "time_end": "3:22", "context": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science, and science based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is Jeff Cavaliere. Jeff Cavaliere holds a Master of Science in Physical Therapy and is a certified strength and conditioning specialist. He did his training at the University of Connecticut Storrs, one of the top five programs in the world in physical therapy and sports medicine. I discovered Jeff Cavaliere over 10 years ago from his online content. His online content includes information about how to train for strength, how to train for hypertrophy, which is muscle growth, how to train for endurance, as well as how to rehabilitate injuries to avoid muscular imbalances, nutrition and supplementation. I've always found his content to be incredibly science based, incredibly clear, sometimes surprising, and always incredibly actionable. It is therefore not surprising that he has one of the largest online platforms for fitness, nutrition, supplementation, and injury rehabilitation. Jeff has also worked with an enormous number of professional athletes and has served as head physical therapist and assistant strength coach for the New York Mets. Again, the content that Jeff Cavaliere has posted online has been so immensely useful to me over the years, that I was absolutely thrilled to get the chance to sit down with him and ask him about everything from how to train in terms of how to split up the body parts that you train across the week, how to integrate strength training and endurance training, when to stretch, how to stretch. Indeed, we talked about nutrition, we talk a bit about supplementation. We talk about how to really avoid creating imbalances in muscle and in neural control over muscle. This is one thing that's really wonderful about Jeff is he really has an understanding of not just how muscles and bones, and tendons and ligaments work together, but how the nervous system interfaces with those. We talked about the mental side of training, including when to bring specific concentration to the muscles that you're training, and when to think more about how to move weights through space and think more about the movements overall. I'm certain that you'll find the conversation that we held to be immensely useful and informative for your fitness practices and also for how you mentally approach fitness in general, and how to set up a lifelong fitness practice, one that will give you the strength that you desire, one that will give you the aesthetic results that you desire. One that will set you up for endurance and cardiovascular health, basically an overall fitness program. I really feel this is where Jeff Cavaliere shines above and beyond so many of the other PTs and fitness so-called influencers that are out there. Again, everything is grounded in science, everything is clear, and everything is actionable. And while we do cover an enormous amount of information during today's episode, if you want to dive even deeper into that information, you can go to athleanx.com, where you'll find some of Jeff's programs. You can also find him at Athlean-X on YouTube. There you'll find videos for instance, like the, how to repair or heal from lower back pain. Something that I actually followed directly long before I ever met Jeff, has over 32 million views, and that is not by accident, it's because the protocols there again are surprising and actionable. They relieved my back pain very quickly without surgery. So I'm immensely grateful for that content. And it extends into everything from again, hypertrophy, endurance and strength training and so on.

{"question": "Is willpower a limited resource that can be depleted with each decision, or are there alternative explanations for why people struggle to engage in certain behaviors?", "doc_id": "cwakOgHIT0E_3", "video_id": "cwakOgHIT0E", "video_title": "How to Increase Your Willpower & Tenacity | Huberman Lab Podcast", "video_header": "Ego Depletion & Willpower as a Limited Resource; Controversy", "segment_idx": "3", "time_start": "10:40", "time_end": "19:11", "context": "before we get into the discussion of neural circuits I'd like to talk about the psychology of willpower and this is something that really has been considered by psychologist for well over a hundred years William James wrote about this the ancient Greeks wrote about this the topic of willpower is certainly not a new one and yet the formal study of willpower power in the laboratory context that is bringing human subjects into the laboratory and examining what sorts of conditions allow them to engage their willpower and tenacity what sorts of conditions really sap or drain their willpower and tenacity and of course parallel experiments done in what we call preclinical models which are animal Studies have revealed to us a lot about the sorts of conditions that allow us to generate willpower and the sorts of conditions that drain our willpower now if we are to throw our arms around that entire literature there is a big batch of that literature not the whole batch but there's a big batch of that literature that believed and still believes that willpower is a limited resource much like fuel in the body or fuel in a car now the idea of willpower as a limited resource is certainly not a new idea but again the formal study of willpower and willpower as a limited resource really dates back a little over 20 25 years when Roy bister and colleagues started to explore the idea that of course had been kicked around for years that with each additional decision that we have to engage across the day and with each additional bout of willpower that we have to draw on as a resource that we would drain this reservoir of willpower that we all have within us now bow meister and colleagues refer to that process as ego depletion now when people hear the word ego some people think Freud ego super ego id and so forth most people think ego like somebody having a big personality where they think a lot of themselves when Bal Meister referred to Ego depletion he was defining ego depletion as a concept of oneself and a concept of outside challenges and the degree of effort required to bridge one's concept of self and those challenges and so ego depletion is really a operational construct within the field of psychology so we don't want to get too distracted by that word ego there's a tendency anytime people hear ego if they hear narcissism or if they hear gaslighting to immediately assume that they know what that means when in fact the formal definitions of those quite often differ from the way that they're kicked around on social media the internet and even in a lot of popular writing about psychology okay so let's just note that ego depletion is the term that Bal Meister used to describe the ability for our willpower to be depleted with each successive attempt to engage willpower and by extension our ability to replenish our degree of willpower if we take a break from making decisions and engaging our willpower but ego depletion itself isn't the Focus right now the Focus right now is whether or not indeed willpower is a limited resource and whether or not with each decision that we make and each effort to either engage in an activity that we prefer not to at least in that moment and with each attempt to resist a behavior thought Etc that is pulling on us or that we feel that we want to engage in by default either you know eating the cookie or thinking the thought or engaging in a particular type of behavior of any kind and we need to resist that that it is draining that willpower resource now before I go any further I know that some of you out there are probably aware that ego depletion and the bow Meister theory of willpower as a limited resource has been very contentious especially in recent years and so today what I'm going to do is I'm going to first present present the Bal meister and colleagues work about willpower as a limited resource and then I'm going to present some of the conflicting evidence that Carol D my colleague at Stanford school of medicine and researchers elsewhere have carried out metaanalyses and entirely new experiments which indeed in some cases contradict the findings of Bal Meister but more often than not contradict the conclusions that Bal Meister Drew about willpower so if we are to understand the psychology of willpower and tenacity it's important that we understand and the concepts of ego depletion and willpower as a limited resource even if after hearing all the evidence you decide that willower is not a limited resource and in fact I'm quite confident that once you hear about the bow Meister work and then you hear about the work of DW and others which in some ways counters the conclusions of bow Meister that you'll have a much firmer and certainly much more complete understanding about what tenacity and willpower are and perhaps and here I'm revealing my own leanings when having examined the totality of the data that tenac and willpower in some cases is a limited resource that can be replenished by engaging particular processes within the body that's right within the body but that willpower and tenacity and most importantly how to engage tenacity and willpower especially when you have a lot of challenges in front of you not just one challenge but multiple challenges that need to be carried out throughout the day over weeks over months Etc that tenacity and willpower can be drawn upon repeatedly without them being depleted if you are clear on your beliefs about tenacity and willpower so I realized that what I just brought up was a controversy about something that I haven't even discussed yet so it might seem like a bit of a swirl of information for which there's really no context but the reason I bring up the controversy at this stage of our conversation is that the moment that the words ego depletion or willpower is a limited resource falls out of my mouth I can hear those voices out there saying wait a second I thought that was all debunked and I want to make very clear willpower is a limited resource and ego depletion have not been debunked it's simply a controversial area of psychological research and more importantly for today's discussion we have to understand the theory of willpower as a limited resource if we are to understand the controversy that is the counterargument of what willpower really is that comes from other groups so I really want to give you both sides of the story so that when we get to the underlying neural mechanisms for tenacity and willpower and we get to the tools and protocols for increasing your level of tenacity and willpower and your flexibility of willpower in different contexts that you'll be able to get the most out of those tools and protocols okay so let's take a look at the evidence that willpower is a limited resource I think most of us are familiar with what willpower feels like that is what it feels like to be tenacious and again there are two sides to this coin there's willpower and tenacity of the sort of trying to engage in a behavior when we really don't want to or when our impulse is not to engage in that behavior and I say when our impulse is not to engage in that behavior because often times we want to engage in the behavior we want to study we want to learn the instrument we want to perform well we want to exercise we want the benefits of all those things so it's not that we don't want the outcomes or the rewards of those things and in many cases it's not that we don't enjoy those activities but that for whatever reason we are feeling a lack of motivation we're drifting down that Continuum toward the more apathetic end of things hopefully not all the way to deep depression and apathy but we're drifting that way or we're not far enough up the Continuum and we're not engaging enough motivation to feel like the desire to do something either for its own sake or for the rewards and outcomes of that thing are sufficient to allow us to just do that thing hence the Nike slogan just do it which is a wonderful slogan except that in the absence of any understanding about the mechanisms of how we can get ourselves to just do something oftentimes it falls short and to be honest anytime I hear about people saying well just eliminate the thinking and just do it that is valuable advice until it doesn't work because when it doesn't work it simply doesn't work and then you need to rely on other tools and mechanisms which are the sort that we will talk about today so while I have great respect for the just doit Mantra when it doesn't work it doesn't offer any alternative solutions to engage tenacity and willpower and I do not know anyone on this planet I don't care if you're David Goggins or Courtney dwalter there will be days when telling yourself just do this or just don't do that is not going to be sufficient for you to engage in the behaviors or resist the behaviors or thoughts that you need to engage in or resist that's just reality and we should ask ourselves why is that reality and this is a very important"}
{"question": "How long should I spend outside in the morning to help set my internal clock when it's overcast and not particularly bright?", "doc_id": "oUu3f0ETMJQ_5", "video_id": "oUu3f0ETMJQ", "video_title": "Dr. Samer Hattar: Timing Light, Food, & Exercise for Better Sleep, Energy & Mood", "video_header": "When, How & How Long to View Light for Optimal Sleep & Wakefulness", "segment_idx": "5", "time_start": "20:16", "time_end": "30:14", "context": "that's a perfect segue for us to talk about how light and viewing light can impact our sleep-wake rhythms. And then we'll move into some of the other ways in which light can impact other forms of bodily function. - Yeah, so I love the way you set it up because one of the most interesting and difficult aspect of trying to educate people about light effect on subconscious vision is that it's subconscious. So we're all aware of what we think is intensity because we see the room, but if you talk to people who know how to take photographs and stuff like that, they know that the intensities varies greatly. But our system, because we have to see the same way in very bright conditions and very dim conditions, we're not very good at estimating intensity consciously. So when you try to tell people about intensity, you really struggle because they think they know intensity, but they really don't. - You mean light intensity? - Light intensity. - Yeah. - So the cones themselves have an incredible ability to adapt to different light conditions. So you can see at all different conditions. Otherwise it'd be a disaster. If you don't change the setting on your camera and you go from inside the room to the outside, it becomes completely white, you don't see anything. So if your cones don't adapt to the environment, then you're not going to be able to see in this room and on the beach, right? But the problem is your ipRCGs, the cells that we talked about, they measure intensity pretty well. They really know what intensity is. They have a very good linear measurement of intensity. They don't adapt as well. They don't adapt actually that much, to be honest. So that tells you that subconsciously the system is used to measuring light intensity in a natural environment, because when you are now in the natural environment, you don't have industrialized lighting, then your system is functioning very well. But now when we change these environments, we could really mess up ourselves. So you have to teach people how to understand intensity. And that's something that you have to explain to people. And I think I love to do it myself. I do it in what is called the lowest amount of light required to allow you to see comfortably. So you have to do this as an fun experiment. - Okay, so explain to me how this goes. And maybe we could break up the day into three or four parts. So let's say assuming that most people wake up in the morning- - Mm hm. - As opposed to night shift workers, et cetera, we could talk about later. - Right. - But they wake up in the morning, so let's divide the day into quarters. What is the proper way to interact with light in the first part of the day? - So, I honestly think the easiest thing is waking up, get as much light as you can. - To your eyes? - Yeah, it's really nice. Your system is prime. If you're entrained, it's prime to get light, the sun should be out. Most animals in the wild, they actually seem to track the sun. The sun has a huge influence on life on earth. It's actually life on earth is because of sun. So, that's easy. In the morning when you wake up, you need light. Just get the light. - Okay, so what is the behavioral practice that you recommend? Let's say somebody is in a condition where there's a lot of cloud cover. - Yeah. - Is it important to get outside? - So, I have to tell you, the cloudiest day is going to be much more brighter than your room. You could ask any photographer. A cloudy day, unless it's really dark, dark clouds, usually cloudy days have much more light outside than inside the room, even when you have good lighting inside the room. So I think in the outside is usually even when it's cloudy, you're going to get to enough intensity to help you adjust your cycle to the day-night cycle. - So, how long do you... These are general rules of thumb, but how long do you recommend people go outside? - So, if you do it daily, you possibly need very few. If you do it daily, because remember this thing is going to happen on a daily matter. So, let's say 15 minutes. - So, the clock is tracking it on a regular basis? - Absolutely. It's photon counting, it's tracking. I would say 15 minutes. If you don't do it daily, you may want to increase it. And we'll talk about when you travel, what you could do, but yeah, 15 minutes should be fine. You do it more, it doesn't hurt. - And through a window, my understanding is that through a window, it dramatically decreases the amount of light energy coming in. - It depends on how thick the windows are and how dark they are. So, but it's also nice to go outside and to feel the seasons. - Sunglasses off? - I don't use sunglasses. - Yeah, but you have your Jordanian photopigment. - Yeah, yeah, that's right. - You know, so, yeah. Whereas my eyes are very sensitive, right? - No, but I personally, if I'm in the shade or if it's not incredibly bright, I try to, especially in the morning, but I'm also an early person. So we have to differentiate between early- - What time do you wake up? - I wake up at 4:30 in the morning. - But the sun isn't out yet. - It's not out yet, so it's- - So, what do you do? You turn on artificial lights? - I usually don't turn on artificial light because I know the sun is going to come up eventually, but that's why I don't like the change in the timing that they do. - Wait, but what do you do between 4:30 a.m. and 7:00 a.m.? - I mean, I look at my computer, and my phone. - Oh, I see. - So possibly I get enough light, but in reality, I mean as long as you let your body get the morning sunlight, which I think is really, to me and there is no evidence of this, but to me, if you look at all animals, plants, this morning sunlight seems to be very important. And we don't have experiments to show it, but I have a gut feeling that it has a huge impact on humans. - Well, Jamie Zeitzer's lab at the Stanford Sleep Lab has shown that these early morning light flashes can adjust the total amount of sleep- - Absolutely. - That one will get. It makes it easier to get into sleep. - Absolutely, absolutely. And Ken Wright also did this beautiful camping experiments that showed that- - Maybe you could describe those 'cause those are beautiful experiments. - Oh, yeah, they are beautiful experiments. He took these college students that had a late onset of sleep and late waking time, and then he said, let's go camping and just don't use any artificial light and you could go to sleep as late or as early as you want, and wake up as late or as early. And he found a huge shift in their sleep pattern just by exposing them to the light-dark cycle. I mean, so- - And it has lasted. - And it lasted, yeah. - Even after they came back. - Exactly. - Those two days of camping reset the circadian clock? - Seven days, but it lasted. Yeah, it's pretty amazing. Yeah, it's really incredible. - Okay, so get bright light of some sort early in the day, ideally sunlight, even on a cloudy day, it's going to be- - Absolutely. - Brighter than indoor light. - So that's easy. - Okay, so then- - And the other thing that I would like to mention to people, if you think it's very dim outside, let's say it's very cloudy, stay longer. So remember intensity is only one component. Duration is also important because remember that the circadian system is not like the image system. In the image system you have to change every second because you're looking at different objects. You have to change your perception. But for the circadian system it's trying to figure out where am I in the day-night cycle? So the more you give them the information, the better you are. So, if it's very bright, you don't need a lot because it's clearly going to make you fire like crazy. But if it's not bright, stay longer, stay for one hour. You know, have your coffee outside or something like that. It's just going to help. - I think you said something extremely important, which is that this circadian system is trying to figure out when you are in time. - Exactly. - Not where you are in space. - Sorry, I said, where you are in time. - Yeah. - I mean when you are. - Oh no, no, I wasn't correcting you. I just meant that I think fundamentally that's the incredible thing about this system. - Absolutely. - That you have this clock, this 24 hour clock in your brain, but it needs to be synchronized to the outside. So could we go a little deeper into this circadian setting behavior and come up with some general rules of thumb? So, let's say it's a very bright day. - Mm hm, mm hm. - Extremely bright. No clouds, the sun's out. You said 10 minutes, 15 minutes. - And I'll tell you if you're sensitive, you don't even have to go in the sun. You could be in the shade. There's going to be so many photons out there in the shade. It's going to be perfect. You don't even have to see the sun. You don't have to have the sun. You know, it's great for vitamin D, that's a different story. You could do this for your skin and protect your skin. That's not my area of expertise, but for that effect on the circadian system, as long as you're outside in the shade and it's sunny day, 10 to 15 minutes should be ample amount. - Okay and then let's say it's kind of overcast. You know, it's not particularly bright or there's solid cloud cover, but obviously the sun is out, but it's not as bright. How long do you think it would take to set the clock? - 10 to 15 should be sufficient. Stay for half an hour. Stay for 45 minutes. If it's very darker out, stay for longer. - Okay and if for some reason, one finds themselves very far north, and it's very, very dense a cloud cover. How long and at what point should somebody consider using an artificial light source to mimic the sunlight? - Yeah, honestly, this is where we don't have a lot of information still, because this is where we're going to discuss this maybe in more detail, that if you put humans in artificial conditions, the circadian system is very sensitive to light, but in reality, in the real environment, light also is affecting other aspects that are independent of the setting of the circadian pacemaker. - Okay. - And these which we call the direct effect of light on mood, for example. So, that is very hard to figure out what intensity you need to use. And we haven't done enough experiments 'cause this system has been discovered just recently. But I would say if you use bright light in the morning, and I mean, it's hard for me to give numbers. It can get complicated. But yeah, I mean, honestly, if you're that far north"}

And it depends on what's driving up ApoB. So ApoB, remember, is the concentration of LDL and VLDL particles. And what do they carry? Cholesterol and triglycerides. So anything that reduces cholesterol and reduces triglycerides, is going to reduce ApoB. Triglycerides are generally driven by carbohydrate intake. So more insulin-resistance, more carbohydrate intake, more triglycerides. So we, I mean clinically, this is readily apparent to anyone who treats patients. If you restrict carbohydrates, you will reduce triglycerides. That just happens all day long. But if you reduce triglycerides by raising fat intake so much, it can still raise ApoB. So you have to be able to think about it. So in an ideal world, it's can you lower saturated fat, which tends to be the one that is most driving ApoB, while lowering carbohydrate, and then see what you can get. But here's the reality of it is, there's nobody with dietary intervention that's going to get to a level of 30 milligrams per deciliter. I mean, I've never seen anything. - Pure dietary intervention. - Yeah. - So what are the other things that- - It's got to be pharmacologic at this point. - Statin type interventions? - Well, now you have multiple classes of drugs. So the tried and true is the statin. So statins work by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis, and the net effect of that is that the, so the liver is really sensitive to cholesterol levels. It doesn't want too much, it doesn't want too little. When you inhibit cholesterol synthesis, the liver says, I want more cholesterol. So it puts more LDL receptors on its surface, and it pulls the LDL out of circulation. That's what lowers the LDL in the circulation. So, you know, again, nine statins in use today, we typically use four of them. The side effect profile, contrary to kind of all the sort of statin-hating propaganda out there, very benign, right? 5% of people experience muscle soreness, which reverses upon cessation. - Cognitive effects? - Again, I think it's, in terms of actual comparing it in a placebo, no effect whatsoever, right. So does that mean that you put a patient on it, they won't complain of something? No, but if you look at clinical trials, there's no evidence whatsoever that statins impair cognition. There's also no evidence in clinical trials that they accelerate the risk of neurodegenerative disease. In fact, it's the opposite. Now we will, there's a very nuanced case we make, Andrew, which is we'll look at patients with highly suppressed desmosterol levels. We will back off. We do want to maintain desmosterol above a certain level, because of some evidence that is still, I think, very preliminary, but enough for us that we say, why take the chance? We have so many other tools to lower cholesterol, why would we over-suppress synthesis in a susceptible individual? So the next tool you look at is a drug that blocks the absorption, or the reabsorption of cholesterol. Remember that Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter? So that guy has a drug called ezetimibe that just mechanically blocks it. So in people, and that's why I mentioned earlier, we measure all those sterols in people, so we also measure things called phytosterols. And the phytosterols give us an indication of how active that transporter is. So the higher your phytosterols, the more likely you are to respond to ezetimibe. Next class of drugs is a drug that blocks cholesterol synthesis, but only in the liver. So the statin does it globally. This other drug called bempedoic acid does it only in the liver. So it has a very similar mechanism to statins. Different enzyme. Not quite as potent, but way fewer side effects. So any patient that's having a response to statins that's adverse, we'll try this other thing. - What's it called, one more time? - Bempedoic acid. - Bempedoic acid. - The most potent drug of the lot is the PCSK9 inhibitor. So PCSK9, it's a protein that was discovered in the late '90s, I believe, is responsible for the degradation of LDL receptors. This was first discovered in people who had a condition called familial hypercholesterolemia, or FH. So these are people that have incredibly high cholesterol. Typically their total cholesterol level is 300. Their LDL cholesterol is typically, you know, north of 200 milligrams per deciliter. This is a disease that is defined by the phenotype, not the genotype. So the phenotype has a very clear definition, which I basically just gave you. The genotype is, there's a million paths to get there. There's over 3000 mutations that are known to produce that phenotype. This was discovered to be one of them. In people who had hyper functioning PCSK9, this protein was just constantly hammering and destroying the LDL receptors. And so their LDL would be huge. And by extension, their total cholesterol would be. So in 19, no sorry, in 2006, Helen Hobbs and colleagues discovered an opposite group of population. People who had LDL cholesterol naturally of 10 to 20 milligrams per deciliter, which would be an ApoB of about 20 milligrams per deciliter, and who never got heart disease. They were immune to heart disease, no matter how long they live. And they had the opposite, they had hypofunctioning PCSK9. And so that was 2006 in the \"New England Journal of Medicine.\" That basically got a whole bunch of drug companies hot on the trail of producing a drug to mimic it. So now we have these antibodies, and they're wildly effective. - What percentage of your patients over 45 do you have on either a statin or on one of these other classic compounds? - Well, often it's in combinations, and I would say 80%. - Eight zero? - Well you have to remember what our objective is. Like, we're in the business of trying to make sure people live as long as possible. And you have to take a sort of world view of this, right? If you, like what's the most prevalent cause of death globally? - Say cardiovascular disease. - Yeah, and like, how close is it? So the last year before COVID, COVID kind of messes up these numbers a little bit, but if you go to 2019, 18.6 million people died of heart disease. Number two, cancer, 10 million. Like nothing's in the zip code of atherosclerosis. And if you remember what I just said, if you took everybody in their 20s and reduced them to a level of that of a child, you'd make ASCVD an orphan disease. - So. - So the question is can you do that? - Why don't we hear more, why don't we hear more about this? I realize there's some nuance. It's not straightforward, it's not as simple as saying, eat less cheese, red meat and watch your LDL, get on a statin. But why do we hear so little about ApoB, in the general discussion? Social media is such a skewed landscape, as we know. People shouting into tunnels of varying clarity. Some are beautiful bronze tunnels with clean walls and others are sewer lines, right. And they all converge in the same place. - Yeah. - Right, as we know. But why do we hear so little about this? I mean, I'm not on a statin, but now I'm beginning to think that maybe that might be a good idea to consider one of these other compounds. I don't know the last time I looked at my ApoB specifically, I'm guessing my physician did. But why don't we hear more about this? This sounds so important. It sounds like the most important conversation, 'cause all the hormone stuff"}
{"question": "What is the role of the preoptic area in the hypothalamus in regulating body temperature and how does it collect information from the body?", "doc_id": "77CdVSpnUX4_10", "video_id": "77CdVSpnUX4", "video_title": "Dr. Craig Heller: Using Temperature for Performance, Brain & Body Health", "video_header": "Hyperthermia", "segment_idx": "10", "time_start": "27:47", "time_end": "31:45", "context": "because you've mentioned them a few times. Before I ask about what the portals are exactly and how they work and how they can be leveraged for performance, there's a question that my neurobiologist self can't resist, but ask. We have this thermostat in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus, which is interesting to me, the medial preoptic area is also one that's known to be sexually dimorphic, depending on testosterone exposure early in life, or et cetera. Although people should just note that it's not actually testosterone that creates these sexual dimorphism, these differences. Actually testosterone converted into estrogen. It's actually estrogen is the effector, which is fascinating. Nonetheless, we've got this area that acts as a thermostat. And you said it's collecting information from the whole body. Does that mean that there are pathways, as the neuroscientists like you and I refer to them, as these afferent or input pathways from the body to the preoptic area, is there a map of our body in the preoptic area? 'Cause I have to imagine that you can't have the information just coming from the left shoulder, just from the right toe. It sounds like you need a pretty, probably a pretty crude map, but that you need a complete map of the body surface there. - Well, you don't need a complete map in the hypothalamus. I mean, that thermal afferent information that you've mentioned, it also goes to the somatosensory cortex. So you know if an ice cube has touched you on the back, but that doesn't necessarily translate into a change in, let's say you're shivering or sweating. So the information that's going to the hypothalamus is more integrated representation of body temperature. - So it's sort of an average of what's happening- - It's an average. - Across the body. So if I were to, let's say I get hot on a hot day and Popsicles, when we were in summer camp, I went to a sports camp near here actually, and we'd run around like crazy. And then we'd get into the shade if we could, but we were, Popsicles. It was all about Popsicles. - Brain freeze. - Or the kids were putting ice cubes down each other's shirts or something. But that's an average, because other parts of the body aren't exposed, the mouth is exposed to the ice in the Popsicle case or the cold cubes are in the hands. As you said, it feels really good. - It feels good. Yeah. - But it sounds like it feels deceptively good, because in reality could still be quite warm internally. - Absolutely. Yeah. - Interesting. - Yeah. You can feel great and have a dangerously hyperthermic temperature, but I should say that when you get into the danger zone, things get bad fast. - What are some of the symptoms that people could be on the lookout for for hyperthermia? - Essentially, it's almost ironic that if individuals are transitioning into heat stroke, they actually vasoconstrict and they stop sweating. And that's a pathological situation. I couldn't begin to explain it. But essentially you are just feeling exhausted. You're feeling miserable. The heart rate is very high. Your heart rate goes up as your core temperature goes up, called cardiac drift. So you just feel rotten. But that's why since it's not a danger signal that you can translate immediately into, oop, I'm going into heat stroke, that's why people can overcome their bad feeling with motivation to continue going, to work harder. So there've been a number of high profile athletic deaths due to heat stroke that were during practice. Not in competition when people are really trying to do it, but in practice, which shows they were just motivated to push."}

been light right I mean you were talking about seasonal changes um we know there especially as you go up to Nordic countries there are seasonal changes in the amount of Light by time of year atic ones in fact less so at the equator of course um light temperature food movement and it it's sort of interesting and and at the same time perhaps it should have been obvious to us that there are stimy that our bodies have evolved to adapt to in very powerful ways and so the idea that temperature heat and cold could evoke these tremendous physiological changes that are beneficial for us probably shouldn't surprise us at all I mean I mean this is why we I mean these are not um ESO esoteric mechanisms they're actually the the foundational mechanisms by which our our body and the bodies of other animals adapt um so I do have a question about the uh different ways that people could approach deliberate cold exposure so for instance um children uh I've been to Bas where there are kids you know six or seven years old with their parents at the B um and so they're in hot sauna I'm not suggesting people do this if they're if they're not you know adapted to it and you know talk to your parents kids and talk to your kids's parents um talk to your doctors um but is remarkable I mean uh children doing sauna from a young age or deliberate cold exposure are there any data on this and is it safe assuming that you know obviously that they can swim and or they're doing this in a in a tub or shower um and then I'd also like to ask you about are there any additional male female differences I know you're study focused um on men but um other Studies have focused on both and you of course um are a woman and can attest to your own experience with this um so children men women um differences there in terms of protocols is there anything that people should build into the structure of of their deliberate cold exposure that's unique to that uh so yeah so this was on cold exposure so um yeah I think that um starting with the the question about children um I think that it's important to to think about as children are smaller than adults so we cannot really completely transfer all the information and the benefits and also protocols for how long and and and stuff like that to children we cannot do that because they are just smaller in mass and one study that actually um proves this is a study where they have compared heat loss uh in um children boys who were 12 years old uh compared to um adults um men and looked at the heat loss of the core temperature and exposed them to a one or one or two minutes um cold exposure or immersion up to the neck and what they saw was that the the the boys in this study could actually defend the core temperature in same way as the adults could but they had to use their muscles way faster so it means that they couldn't stay for as long uh and they use more energy to defend their core temperature compared to the to the adults but for one minute it seems that they could actually comp but they will be colder when they then come out because they are smaller in their Mass to their Rao right so it means that if the surface is so large on children and their mass and muscles being smaller to that ratio it means that they can be in the water uh less time before they get hypothermic so just think about that they are just smaller they can't defend their temperature for a very long time but in this study they saw that for up to I think it it was a minute or so they could minute one minute yeah I'm glad you mentioned hypothermia and smaller bodied um people children uh I used to do some um Pacific uh ocean swims in the morning um without wet suits and I adapted to it pretty quickly and these are fairly long swim and we brought an excellent swimmer with us um a that was interning with me for a while um is 16 years old at the time and um very lean and um he wasn't small for his age but he was smaller than us than the it was all guys on the swim that day Sometimes women join us um and he got hypothermic um and he's an excellent swimmer and he didn't report feeling overly cold but um fortunately we got him to Shore and heated him up again um so he lived I don't think his mother's going to ever let him go swimming with us again he's thriving in the world he's a university student now um and he recalls that swim I mean this is why you always want to Ocean swim with a buddy with people um yeah he he became hypothermic his teeth turned yellow he was kind slurring his words he wasn't making sense you know we got him on the shore and he was kind of you know drooling and a little bit semi euphoric and then kind of you know it was um hypothermia is no joke so I think yeah so I I I'm really glad that this is coming up because the cold is a powerful stimulus and um and I and kids are at a and smaller bodied people are at at greater risk of hypothermia so a good reason to approach it with caution maybe start with cold showers get uh then cold immersion and still water natural water and open bodies of water of course are always going to be um more dangerous for other reasons currents and things of that sort exactly okay I'm drowning yeah so important note there um what about"}
{"question": "What lessons did you learn from witnessing firsthand the impact of war on civilians, particularly the long-lasting effects of trauma, hate, and the loss of cultural heritage, and how do you think these lessons can inform our understanding of geopolitics and the potential for future global conflicts?", "doc_id": "6I5I56uVvLw_3", "video_id": "6I5I56uVvLw", "video_title": "Dr Lex Fridman: Navigating Conflict, Finding Purpose & Maintaining Drive | Huberman Lab Podcast #100", "video_header": "Ukraine, Russia, War & Geopolitics", "segment_idx": "3", "time_start": "12:15", "time_end": "23:10", "context": "that we're sitting here because you recently went overseas to a very intense war zone, literally, the Ukraine. And the entire time that you were there, I was genuinely concerned. The world's a unpredictable place, in general. And we don't always get the only vote and what happens to us. So first of all, welcome back safely, one peace, one alive peace. And what was that like? I mean, at a broad level, at a specific level, what drew you there? What surprised you? And how do you think it changed you in coming back here? LEX FRIDMAN: I think there's a lot to say. But first, it is really good to be back. One of the things that when you go to a difficult part of the world or a part of the world that's going through something difficult, you really appreciate how great it is to be an American. Everything. The easy access to food. Despite what people think, the stable, reliable rule of law. The lack of corruption in that you can trust that if you start a business or if you take on various pursuits in life that there's not going to be at-scale manipulation of your efforts such that you can't succeed. So this kind of capitalism is in it's-- the ideal of capitalism is really still burning bright in this country. And it really makes you appreciate those aspects. And also just the ability to have a home for generations, across generations. So you can have your grandfather live in Kentucky in a certain city. And then his children lived there, and you live there, and then it just continues on and on. That's the kind of thing you can have when you don't have war. Because war destroys entire communities. And it destroys histories, generations, like life stories that stretch across the generations. So-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah yeah. I didn't even think about that until you said just now. But photographs, hard drives get destroyed or just abandoned. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Libraries. I mean, nowadays, things exist in the cloud but are still a lot of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --material goods that are irreplaceable, right. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, even in rural parts of the United States, they don't exist in the cloud, right. A lot of people still, well, even in towns, they still love the physical photo album of your family. A lot of people still store their photographs of families in the VHS tapes and all that kind of stuff, yeah. But I think-- there's so many things I've learned and really felt the lessons. One of which is nobody gives a damn when your photos are gone and all that kind of stuff, your house is gone. The thing time and time again I saw for people that lost everything is how happy they are for the people. They love the friends, the family that are still alive. That's the only thing they talk about. That, in fact, they don't mention actually with much dramatic sort of vigor about the trauma of losing your home. They're just non-stop saying how lucky they are that person X person Y is still here. And that makes you realize that when you lose everything, it's still-- it makes you realize what really matters, which is the people in your life. I mean, a lot of people kind of realize that later in life, when you're facing mortality, when you're facing your death, or you get a cancer diagnosis, that kind of stuff. I think people here in America, in California, with the fires, you you can still lose your home. You are going to realize, like, nah. It doesn't really matter. It's a pain in the ass but what matters is still the family, the people, and so on. I think the most intense thing-- I talked to several hundred people, some of which is recorded. I've really been struggling to put that out because I have to edit it myself. And so you're talking about 30, 40 hours of footage, and it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is emotionally struggling? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. It is extremely difficult. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Are you like emotional struggle? LEX FRIDMAN: It's extremely difficult. So I talked to a lot of politicians. The number two in the country, number three. I'll be back there to talk to the president to do a three-hour conversation. Those are easy to edit. They're really heartfelt and thoughtful folks from different perspectives on the geopolitics of the war. But the ones that really hard to edit is like grandmas that are in the middle of nowhere. They lost everything. They still have hope, they still have love. And some of them have-- some of them, many of them, unfortunately, have now hate in their heart. So in February, when Russia invaded Ukraine, this is the thing I realized about War. One of the most painful one lessons is that war creates generational hate. We sometimes think about war as a thing that kills people, kills civilians, kills soldiers, takes away lives, injures people. But we don't directly think about the secondary and tertiary effects of that which lasts decades. Which is anyone who's lost the father or a mother or a daughter or a son, they now hate not just the individual soldiers or the leaders that invaded their country but the entirety of the people. So it's not that they hate Vladimir Putin or hate the Russian military. They hate Russian people. So that tears the fabric of a thing that, for me-- my half my family's from Ukraine, half of my family is from Russia. But there is-- I remember the pain the triumph of World War two still resonates through my entire family tree. And so, you remember when the Russians and Ukrainians fought together against this Nazi invasion. You remember a lot of that. And now, to see the fabric of this peoples torn apart completely with hate is really, really difficult. For me, just to realize that things will just never be the same on this particular cultural, historical aspect. But also, there's so many painful ways in which things will never be the same. Which is we've seen that it's possible to have a major hot war in the 21st century. I think a lot of people are watching this. China is watching this. India is watching this. United States is watching this and thinking we can actually have a large-scale war. And I think the lessons learned from that. Might be the kind that lead to a major World War III in the 21st century. So one of the things I realized watching the whole scene is that we don't know shit about what's going to happen in the 21st century. And it might-- we kind of have this intuition like surely there's not going to be another war. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like we'll just coast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, pandemic. Yeah-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: And back to normal. LEX FRIDMAN: Back to normal-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Whatever that is. LEX FRIDMAN: But you have to remember, at the end of World War I, as Woodrow Wilson called it, the war to end all wars. Nobody ironically, in a dark way, it was also the roaring 20s when people believed this. There will never be another World War. And 20 years after that, the rise of Nazi Germany. A charismatic leader that captivated the minds of millions and built up a military that can take on the whole world. And so it makes you realize that this is still possible. This is still possible. And then the tension. You see this-- the media machine, the propaganda machine, that I've gotten to see every aspect of. It's still fueling that division between America and China. Between Russia and India. And then Africa has a complicated thing that's trying to figure out who are they with, who are they against. And just this tension is building and building. And like it makes you realize like we might-- the thing that might shake human civilization may not be so far off. That's a realization you get to really feel. I mean, there's all kinds of other lessons. And one of which is propaganda. Is I got to-- I get a lot of letters, emails. And some of them are full of really intense language, full of hate from every side toward me. Or, well, the hate is towards me as representing side X. And X stands as a variable for every side. So either I'm a Zelensky show, or I'm a Putin show, or I'm a NATO show, or I'm an America-- America show-- American empire show. Or I'm a Democrat or a Republican. Because it's already been, in this country, politicized. I think there's a sense of Ukraine is this place that's full of corruption. Why are we sending money there? I think that's kind of the messaging on the Republican side. On the Democratic side-- I'm not even keeping track of the actual messaging and the conspiracy theories and the narratives, but they are-- the tension is there. And I get to feel it directly. And what you get to really experience is there's a large number of narratives that all are extremely confident themselves that they know the truth. People are convinced, first of all, that they're not being lied to. People in Russia think there's no propaganda. They think that, yes, yes, there is like state-sponsored propaganda, but we're all smart enough to ignore the lame propaganda that's everywhere. They know that we can think on our own, we know the truth, and everybody kind of speaks in this way. Everybody in the United States says, well, yes, there's mainstream media, they're full of messaging and propaganda, but we're smart. We can think on our own. Of course, we see through that. Everybody says this. And then the conclusion of their thought is often hatred towards some group, whatever that group is. And the more you've lost, the more intense the feeling of hatred. It's a really difficult field to walk through calmly and with an open mind and try to understand what's really going on."}
{"question": "What are some effective ways to optimize testosterone and estrogen levels naturally, and how does light-viewing behavior play a role in achieving this?", "doc_id": "qJXKhu5UZwk_19", "video_id": "qJXKhu5UZwk", "video_title": "The Science of How to Optimize Testosterone & Estrogen", "video_header": "Spring Fever: Tyrosinase, Hair Color, Mating Frequency", "segment_idx": "19", "time_start": "57:49", "time_end": "1:04:33", "context": "now, humans are not seasonal breeders, but if you understand the biology of how light impacts various neurotransmitters and hormones, you'll set yourself up for a deep understanding of what you should do with your light-viewing behavior. So several species of animals, many species of animals, in fact, like rabbits and fox, and various mustelids, like ferrets and ermines, change their pellage color across the seasons, this might be kind of a duh, but fox in winter are often white or light gray, and those same animals will be brown or darker-colored in the summertime and spring months. Now, those same animals breed in the spring, and they shut down breeding, they actually shut down ovulation, they often shut down testosterone production in the winter months, so right now I'm just correlating color of fur with tendency to breed, tendency to breed, as we know, is going to be related to the levels of sex steroid hormones, estrogen and testosterone. Now, why would these two things be linked? Well, it turns out that dopamine is the link between them, so dopamine has a precursor, that precursor is tyrosine, which is amino acid, comes from food, and when dopamine levels are high, as I mentioned before, there's a tendency for more gonadotropin-releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, all the hormones that come from the hypothalamic-pituitary axis and stimulate estrogen and testosterone release from the ovary and testes, dopamine basically increases all of that. The precursor to dopamine is tyrosine, but the precursor to a lot of the melanin-producing elements of cells that give pigmentation, including for the hair, is tyrosine and tyrosinase, an enzyme, so yes, the same amino acid-based pathway, and many of the same enzymes that are devoted to dopamine and dopamine increasing the sex steroid hormones are devoted to giving pigmentation to the hair and skin, and this is why in the summer months, when days are longer, animals are breeding more, and this is also why in the winter months when days are shorter, animals are breeding less, this is also why in humans, many people, not all, feel an elevation in mood in the spring and summer months because of the amount of sunlight they're getting is increased relative to the winter months. Now, some of you may be saying, \"I love the fall, I love the winter,\" sensitivity to light in these dopamine systems has a strong genetic component, so you go to some areas of the world, I have relatives who are Scandinavian, and in some areas of Scandinavia, people know that there's a kind of seasonal affective disorder, there's kind of a seasonal depression and people get sadder and more quiescent in the winter, there's actually less going out, and therefore, there's less sexual behavior, there's less partying and things of that sort, but other people will say, \"No, during the winter months, I feel great \"and I love the holidays around winter,\" et cetera, so there's a lot of variation, but in general, the pathway is the following, increased viewing of sunlight, and it has to be to the eyes, it's not to the skin, increased viewing of sunlight increases dopamine levels in the brain, increased dopamine levels in animals and humans increases the amount of these melanocytes and the activity of these melanin-producing cells, which give pigmentation to the skin and hair, and indirectly, increase the amount of testosterone and estrogen, and thereby, reproductive behavior, feelings of well-being, social interactions, reductions in anxiety, et cetera, all of which should make sense based on what we've talked about already in terms of the biology and the impact of these steroid hormones on various aspects of the mind and body. So how does this translate to a protocol? This translates to the protocol of, if you want to optimize testosterone and estrogen, you need to get your light-viewing behavior correct, it's not just about optimizing your sleep, which is also important, it's about getting sufficient amount of light in your eyes so you have sufficient levels of dopamine, so the simple protocols for that I've reviewed before, but it means getting anywhere from 2 to 10 minutes of bright light exposure in your eyes early in the day, it is not sufficient to do this with sunglasses unless you have to do that for safety reasons, it's fine to wear prescription lenses and contacts, if you can't get sunlight for whatever reason, you want to use bright artificial light, but that is absolutely critical for timing the cortisol release properly, limiting cortisol release to the early part of the day, getting increases in dopamine that are going to promote the production of testosterone and estrogen to healthy levels, the other aspect of light-viewing behavior that's extremely important is to avoid bright light exposure to your eyes in the middle of the night, if you're viewing bright light in the middle of the night, you are suppressing dopamine release, if you're suppressing dopamine release, you are suppressing testosterone levels so much so that I would wager that a major effect of sleep deprivation on reducing testosterone and estrogen is not necessarily because of the lack of sleep per se, it's because usually when people are not getting enough sleep, they're getting too much light in their eyes in the middle of the night as well, a study on this has not been completed yet, but there are two studies published in \"Cell\" and \"Neuron,\" both Cell Press journals, excellent journals, showing that viewing bright light with the eyes in the middle of the circadian night has a detrimental effect on dopamine, and therefore has a detrimental effect on things like testosterone and estrogen, so you can't even begin to talk about supplements and other ways to optimize testosterone, diet and its effects on testosterone and estrogen and fertility and reproductive behavior, et cetera, until you get your breathing right, until you get things like your light-viewing behavior right, so bright light early in the day and throughout the day is great, view as much bright light, ideally sunlight, as you can, as much as you safely can, you obviously don't want to burn your retinas or damage your retinas, so never look at any light that's so bright it's painful to look at, but getting a lot of light in your eyes is not just about adjusting your sleep-wake rhythms, it's also about optimizing your sex steroid hormones, and avoiding bright light in the middle of the night is not just about not disrupting your sleep, it's also about optimizing the sex steroid hormones, and now that you understand a bit of how the sex steroid hormones work and how powerful they are for reducing anxiety and all these other effects, this should be straightforward to do, or hopefully it's inspired you to get your light-viewing behavior and your breathing behavior correct. In fact, in thinking about tools, for many people that are suffering from low levels of estrogen if they want higher levels or low levels of testosterone if they want higher levels,"}

about it it's like what is that Andrew that was the it's like what is that and and it's not like I wasn't in these environments where I've been coached and mentored I I've had coaches and mentors on my ass my whole life like instructors you know it's a nonstop and I I don't know like I couldn't I just couldn't do it until I did it and then and you know it's been a process since and I'm super grateful for it and I don't know where we are in the journey but in terms of like the hero's journey but I hope I'm at Freedom to live some version of it because with my re this is dangerous cuz I only say this like with my really really really close friends I know was going to more people in my CL I feel like a completely different person and none of that stuff really ever goes away it's all a process right and I'm never going to stop the process but I don't even recognize myself in some ways anymore and that's been a good thing because in those times when I was just on the 24-hour Horizon sometimes I just did not know what the was going on other than exactly what I was doing you know and it's just an odd experience to be in a different place and it's scary to know that without that experience and without people really kind of forcing me to get help and things forcing me I might be doing the same stuff which is a hard way to live you know or worse or worse you might not be here or Worse which has happened to many of our buddies you know and I want to go like retroactively hug them and collect them up in like a net and say guys just stop for a second you know like we it doesn't it doesn't have to go there um yeah I feel that the yearning in that statement uh I I suffer from a terrible um very destructive debilitating um desire to travel back into time and fix things it's like it's like I know I don't have my my graduate advisor who un unfortunately all three of my graduate advisor are dead but she used to say um my time machine's broken yeah anytime I'd raise something if you know that the could have would have should have my time machine's broken and and we know that but I listen I felt that statement in every cell of my body it's clear you would but you're also in sharing this this experience and this information you're you're you're doing that now in what we call biology in the interrog grade fashion and you know somebody many people are going to hear this and and cue to the the recognition of what's happening to them hopefully before they get to that line yeah you have to and you just got to tell somebody you know it's like it's crazy how simple that is Andrew I mean months like I can't tell anybody I can't tell anybody well well and maybe we drill into this a little bit deeper because I think that this really speaks to the the the global experience of of Being Human where unlike a physical wound where you know if you see bone exposed you're like this is pretty serious you know we all have different thresholds for what we can tolerate in terms of pain and and seeing ourselves wounded we all don't have to decide what's the difference between hurting and injured but when it comes to psychological stuff we don't know you know we also are dealing with a a world now where some people feel psychologically injured by everything you know so that's the extreme there but what we're I think I think um what comes through and I think people need to perhaps highlight in their minds is when something's kind of nagging or scratching at you Beneath The Sur that voice what do you think that voice is I call it the lowgrade pain okay for me it it was there was a lowgrade just slight hot burning starting in ' 07 probably before that but it was for me it was a weird mix and of like an uncertainty a seeking a this just doesn't feel right like it has to be fixed there has to be an intellectual and achievement way to sort of get around this is where the Buddhist writing and thinking really helped me a lot there has to be a way around this lowgrade unsatisfactory somehow my sense for me and I'm obviously not you know the Dr kti in the room just because of all the things I've learned how it it it it just had to be the this constant I'll use the word trauma but for me it was it was like something had to happen to our system obviously it does something happens to our system that is a little bit of a there's a shock there boom and then a buddy gets killed and then you it's not even always with that then you have extreme firefight or you know close call and then it's just boom boom shock shock shock shock it's almost like getting TBI for the nervous system it's just a constant High it to me it always felt like that constant highend now if you keep going perhaps if you never recognize any of it and you just keep jacking the dopamine and the adrenaline your whole life maybe you can just never recognize it but for me when I shut the engine off and I decided it's not really how I wanted to live and I was trying to work out of that low grade whatever I was residue that I was left with it was like every time I came from home home from deployment I would get sick that night like I would have a fever that night headache and fever and um I tend to get sick at the end of the year last two years it was Christmas this year it was Thanksgiving and um you know bridg and I always joke about it it's because I slightly turn the engine down a little and then the you know the immune system yeah that's the way it works everyone thinks stress depletes the immune system and indeed it can yeah but if you think about it in evolutionary adaptive you know ways go go go go go allows you to saave off the infection or at least to not have the symptoms of combating infection and then when you relax a little bit go on vacation boom you get sick which is not to say constantly stress but um you need to modulate right you got to modulate but when you're on deployments you don't have the option you're in gunfights every yeah so as soon as you turn it off you get sick right but in for me in this particular instance what do I think it is I think it was all of those experiences at once turning the generator all the way off or the electric panel fully off and then it just all came out well for people or anyone listening who is facing that feeling that underlying feeling or who is um challenged with like a breakup a loss of a loved one fear about the future languishing because they don't know what the future holds or the feeling that quote unquote so much has happened or some combination of those five things where do you think the healing process starts I hope again back to the hero's journey I hope hope for every single person that it's not a rock bottom moment but it seems like if you follow a lot of enough people and you hear enough stories um you talk with Dax right Dax shepher yeah he talks about it nonstop like unfortunately I think a version of bottom is where the process starts all the people I know the stories they tell me the process started when they hit some version of bottom what's the quote that I love is um you don't change until the pain of staying the same is worse than the pain of change yeah Amen to that um I have experienced that more times than I would like to admit and that brings me actually to this more macroscopic question my"}
{"question": "What are some effective practices that can help individuals maintain a balanced mental health state along the interoception-to-dissociation continuum, and how can these practices be incorporated into daily life?", "doc_id": "wTBSGgbIvsY_16", "video_id": "wTBSGgbIvsY", "video_title": "How Meditation Works & Science-Based Effective Meditations | Huberman Lab Podcast #96", "video_header": "Model of Interoception & Dissociation Continuum", "segment_idx": "16", "time_start": "1:47:43", "time_end": "1:53:36", "context": "So let's talk about this model of interoception and dissociation and then a meditative practice that can be used to try and anchor us at the right location or the healthy location along that continuum. Let's first imagine the ideal mental health state. And here, I want to acknowledge, nobody achieves or at least maintains this mental health state. I want you to imagine that where you are along this interoceptive-to-dissociative continuum is like a ball bearing, or you represent a sphere that can roll back and forth along the continuum. At one end, you have pure interoception, you're just feeling everything. At the other end, you're completely dissociated. Well, in this one version of mental health, we take that continuum and we fold up the sides so that it looks like a V, okay? On one end, you have interoception. On the other end, you have dissociation. I realize a number of people are listening to this and not watching this on YouTube so they can't see that my hands are now, the heel of my hands are together, the fingers of my hands are apart so it looks like a V, and you are like a ball bearing. Your state is like a ball bearing at the base of that. You are in a trench of perfectly balanced interoception and dissociation, so you can feel things, you can register what's going on in the outside world, but your feelings are not overwhelmed or overtaken by what's happening in the outside world. You are in a perfect place of being able to make rational decisions and yet still feel your feelings. Wouldn't that be lovely? Wouldn't that be lovely if we could be like that whenever we wanted to? And frankly, nobody is like that all the time. More typically, the model of mental health and mood and well-being and perception of self versus others and internal versus external states is one of more of a U, a U shape, where at one end, we have interoception, and at the other end, we have dissociation, and it's kind of U shaped, and your state is more or less like a ball bearing at the base of that U that, you know, it gets pushed from side to side. Maybe, you know, your heart races a little bit because of something bad or good, and that ball bearing shifts towards interoception a little bit more and you notice that your heart is racing. Or perhaps, at any given moment, you know, your mind drifts a little bit while watching a movie or while talking to your partner or while your child is complaining about something and you're thinking about something else, and that ball bearing shifts towards the dissociative state a little bit. That is a mild form of dissociation. And I think most people would agree that being mentally healthy would involve this kind of U-shaped model as well, where it kind of can shift back and forth, but it's not extreme. You're not going from interoceptive-biased all the way to dissociated in any kind of extreme way. The ball bearing stays down near the base of that U. Then, of course, there are states that we all, frankly, go into from time to time where the continuum of interoception and dissociation is essentially flat, where you are a ball bearing at one location or another, depending on whether or not you're watching a movie that you're very engrossed in or you're in a conversation with or in an activity with your partner or a friend, et cetera, that has you very engrossed, maybe matching their state, right? There are a number of states you can imagine where matching one's state is actually healthy and good, and then there are a number of conditions in life and situations in life where being matched to someone else's condition like you're getting yelled at and they're angry so then you're getting angry, and then pretty soon, you know, you're not in the best place along that continuum. And I think that for many people, they find themselves somewhere along that continuum. And a number of practices, including meditation, including exercise, including getting a good night's sleep, including therapy, including journaling, including just doing activities like social engagement that you enjoy, are designed to sort of bring up the edges of that flat continuum into more of a U or concave shape so that that ball bearing, meaning your state of awareness and your state of feeling your own feelings versus paying attention to what's going on around you, is somewhere, again, biased toward the middle. By curling up the edges of that continuum on either end, it biases that state toward the middle. And then, of course, there's the extreme that I think almost everybody would agree is more or less pathologic, which is one in which that continuum is no longer shaped like a deep trench like a V, it's not shaped like a U, it's not flat with the edges curled up a little bit or even flat. It's actually now convex. It looks like a mountain shape, a peak, and that little ball bearing at the top can either drop all the way to one side of pure interoception, just feeling beyond any ability to pay attention to anything else, just feeling one's feelings, being angry, being sad, or even happy, right? Being so extremely happy or manic that you can't pay attention to the fact that it's totally out of context, right, inappropriate for what's going on around you, or dropping to the other side of the continuum where you're so dissociated that you're not engaged with what's going around you. You're truly, quote, unquote, checked out. That shape is one that I think almost all clinicians, if not all clinicians, and most people would say is pathologic because you are either completely checked out or you are completely absorbed in what's going on within you or around you. That mental model that I just created is a simple mental model. It is by no means exhaustive, but it does incorporate a lot of what we think about when we think about mental health and we talk about the ability to be mentally stable, to feel one's feelings, but to still be actively engaged in what's happening around us. And again, it's a continuum that spans from interoceptive awareness to dissociation where the extremes are pathologic and somewhere in the middle is healthier, and then there are practices that bias us toward being in the middle by default. What are those practices? Well, we know for sure"}

{"question": "Can someone with a history of \"cheat days\" be considered to have bulimia or binge eating disorder, and what are the key factors that determine whether someone meets the criteria for these conditions?", "doc_id": "2XGREPnlI8U_24", "video_id": "2XGREPnlI8U", "video_title": "Healthy Eating & Eating Disorders - Anorexia, Bulimia, Binging", "video_header": "Bulimia & Binge-Eating, “Cheat Days”, Thyroid Hormone", "segment_idx": "24", "time_start": "1:48:01", "time_end": "1:52:58", "context": "by self-induced vomiting or by ingestion of laxatives, sometimes also in concert with people taking stimulants and fat burners, over ingestion of stimulus to try and burn off more energy. And then we'll also talk about binge eating disorder, which has a lot of the same features as bulimia, but typically no purging. I'm not going to list off all the clinical criteria that would allow someone to be diagnosed as bulimic or binge eating disorder. But the general features are that they ingest far more calories than they need, anywhere from 10 to 30 times, their daily caloric intake, oftentimes within a two hour period, which is just a staggering amount of food and nutrients in a short period of time. Oftentimes they're overriding those mechanical signals from the body that they're full. It's a really troubling thing to think about, but people are literally gorging themselves with food. This looks a lot like a laboratory animal that has these AgRP neurons stimulated, these neurons that will eat until they almost burst or burst. So, you wonder is that these AgRP neurons that are active almost certainly yes. That they're involved. Although I don't think that that's going to be the major point of intervention, but we're going to talk about other types of interventions. There are a number of clinical criteria. For instance, if somebody has one of these binges once a year, does that make them bulimic? Technically, no, but I certainly don't recommend people do this. If you are one of these people who has so-called cheat days, right? Some of you may be familiar with cheat days. I think they're a little less common now, but the idea is you eat clean for six days or five days a week or two weeks. And then you have a so-called cheat day where you just kind of go wild and eat whatever you want and whatever volumes is that bulimia. And it has some of the contour of bulimia. If you're vomiting afterwards or binge eating disorder, if you're not, does it constitute full blown bulimia or binge eating disorder? And it's pretty hard to say, the criteria that were described to me is that if somebody is doing this at least once a month, over a period of anywhere from two to three months, then it likely would qualify. And I certainly know people who do these cheat days and by those criteria, they have something like binge eating disorder. But in general, one of the hallmark features of bulimia binge eating disorder is that people are unable to control their eating. They're just simply, they're not making the decision to have a cheat day. They're not making the decision to overeat. They are simply driven from the inside without question by way of neurocircuitry. They are driven from the inside to ingest far more food than they need. And in some cases than they would want to eat. So, it's a lot like the habit that we described for anorexia, it's almost like it's turned into a reflux once they get going, all the homeostatic signals are being overridden, all the signals from the body, the leptin, the insulin, the glucose, all that stuff has cosmically sky high. And yet they're just what we, the nerds call hyperphagic, they're just eating like crazy. So, what's going on there? Well, there've been a lot of ideas, about why this arises. There's the so-called thyroid hormone hypothesis. That one's a tricky one. It turns out that cortisol and thyroid hormone concentrations vary according to when the binge purge happened. So, there were some studies that looked at thyroid hormone levels and they found elevated thyroid hormone levels. Thyroid hormone is involved in metabolism and not just the burning of energy, but the use of energy in converting it to different tissues of the body, cartilage bone, fat, and muscle, et cetera, did a whole episode on thyroid and growth hormone. By the way, if you're interested in learning more about thyroid hormone, but thyroid hormone can also be depleted at other phases of the binge purge cycle. Now, without listing off all the terrible things that happen with this binge purge cycle, there are a number of things that are really worth pointing out. One is that the vomiting itself, the use of laxatives that can cause severe disruption to the mucosal lining the mucus lining of the digestive tract can severely disrupt the gut microbiome. It can cause all sorts of even a ulceration of the esophagus and just really terrible stuff. There's a lot of shame associated with bulimia, oftentimes because people are vomiting and it's hard to hide that vomiting behavior, people are aware of it. There's some social isolation. So, you recall from the beginning, it does not appear that sexual trauma is a prerequisite for bulimia. Although sometimes it can occur the hallmark feature of bulimia that distinguishes it from anorexia,"}
{"question": "What is the main difference between working memory and longterm memory?", "doc_id": "szqPAPKE5tQ_6", "video_id": "szqPAPKE5tQ", "video_title": "Understand & Improve Memory Using Science-Based Tools | Huberman Lab Podcast #72", "video_header": "Different Types of Memory", "segment_idx": "6", "time_start": "20:50", "time_end": "25:38", "context": "Before we go any further I want to preface the discussion by saying that there are a lot of different kinds of memory. In fact, were you to take a voyage into the neuroscience, and or psychology of memory you would find an immense number of different terms to describe the immense number of different types of memory that researchers focus on. But for the sake of today's discussion, I really just want to focus on short term memory, medium term memory, and longterm memory. And while there is still debate, as is always the case with scientists, frankly, about the exact divisions between short term, medium, and longterm memory, we can broadly define short term memory and longterm memory. And we can describe a couple different types of those that I think you can relate to in your everyday life. The most common form of short term memory that we're going to focus on is called working memory. Working memory is your ability to keep a chain of numbers in mind for some period of time but the expectation really isn't that you would remember those numbers the next day and certainly not the next week. So a good example would be a phone number. If I were to tell ya a phone number, 493-2938, well you could probably remember it. 493-2938. But if I came back tomorrow and asked you to repeat that chain of numbers, most likely you would not. Unless, of course, we used a particular tool to stamp down that memory into your mind and commit it to longterm memory. Now of course, in this day in age, most people have phone numbers programmed into their phone and they don't really have to remember the exact numbers. It's usually done by contact identity and so forth. So a different example that some of you are probably more familiar with would be those security codes. So you try and log unto an app or a website and it asks you for a security code that's been sent to your text messages and you can either plug that in directly in some cases, or you have to remember that short sequence of anywhere usually from six to seven, sometimes eight numbers. Your ability to do that, to switch back and forth between web pages or apps and plug in that number by remembering the sequence and plugging it in, by texting or keying it in on your keyboard, that's a really good example of working memory. Longterm memory, of the sort that we're going to be talking a lot about today is your ability to commit certain patterns of information, either cognitive information or motor information. Right, the ability to move your limbs in a particular sequence. Over long periods of time. Such that you could remember it a day, or a week, or a month, or maybe even a year or several years later. So we've got short term memory and longterm memory. And we've got this working memory which is sort of keeping something online but then discarding okay. Not online on a computer, but online within your brain. There are also two major categories of memory that I'd like you to know about. One is explicit memory. So this is not necessarily explicit of the sort that you're used to thinking about. But rather the fact that you can declare you know something. So you have an explicit memory of your name. Presumably you have an explicit memory of the house or the apartment that you grew up in. You know something and you know you know it. And you can declare it. So I can ask you, what was the color of the first car that you owned? Or what is the color of your romantic partner's hair? These sorts of things. That's an explicit declarative memory. But you also have explicit procedural memories. Now procedural memories, as the name suggests, involve action sequences. The simplest one, it's almost ridiculously simple, is walking. If I say, how is it that you walk from one room to the other? You'd probably say, well, I go that direction and then I turn left. I say, no, no, no. How is it exactly that you do it? You say, well, I move my left foot, then my right foot, then my left foot. And you could describe that. So it's an explicit procedural memory. So much so that if you were going to teach a young toddler how to walk, you would probably say okay, good, good, try. Okay, then you know, probably that's going to be pre-language for the toddler. But you're going to encourage them to move one leg then the other. And you're going to encourage and reward them for moving one leg then the other. Because you have an explicit procedural memory of how to walk. Okay, almost ridiculously simple. Maybe even truly ridiculously simple, but nonetheless, when you think about it in the context of neural circuits and neural firing, pretty amazing. Even more amazing is the fact that all explicit memories, both declarative and procedural explicit memories can be moved from explicit to implicit. What do I mean by that? Well, in the example of walking you might have chuckled a little bit or kind of shook your head and said, this is a ridiculous thing to ask. How do I walk from one room to the next? I just walk. I just do it. Ah, well, what is just do it? What it is, is that you have an implicit understanding. Meaning your nervous system knows how to walk without you actually having to think about what you know about how to walk. You just get up out of your chair or you get up out of bed and you walk. In the brain you have a structure. In fact, you have one on each side of your brain."}
{"question": "Can doing simple activities like Solus push-ups, fidgeting, or other forms of non-exercise activity thermogenesis really make a significant impact on our metabolism and blood glucose utilization, and are they a viable solution for combating obesity and other chronic diseases?", "doc_id": "8qaBpM73NSk_9", "video_id": "8qaBpM73NSk", "video_title": "Dr. Casey Means: Transform Your

"time_end": "57:12", "context": "I wonder your thoughts on there was a study not sure if you're familiar with it um published at the University of Houston where they looked at what they called Solus push-ups um which all the gym goers are going to roll their eyes um imagine sitting down and raise pressing your toe against the ground and raising your heel so kind of like seated calf raay but no weight right under the desk and this study had some remarkable claims and conclusions um which included as I recall that the activation of this muscle the Solus which makes up about 1% of the body's total musculature um involved caused rather a disproportionate use of blood glucose so it mobilized blood glucose in a good way um and the idea was if people would it's not just bouncing your knee but would actively push their toes against the ground and raise their heels as they were seated and doing work that somehow there would be a positive effect on metabolism and blood glucose utilization I talked a little bit about this on social media and a few other podcasts and and it was interesting to see that sort of attacks that I got like people really didn't like the idea um that this was any different than so-called neat non-exercise and um activated thermogenesis so it's known that people that fidget a lot or or move around a lot burn a lot of calories this actually goes back to some really beautiful work um several decades or more ago from Rothwell and stock who talked about like the fact that animals and people who fidget a lot burn a lot of energy they tend to be thinner they tend to have lower adapost tissue stores um and it's because they're just burning a lot more calories and this is actually what um people who suffer from anorexia which is by the way the most deadly of the psychiatric condition so it's um we're talking about true anorexia are encouraged not to do because um they either do it spontaneously or they learn that it's a very efficient way to burn calories and that's not what they need but many people do need to burn more calories so um bounce in the knee that thing that drives everybody crazy if you're not the one doing it um Solus push-ups uh what are your thoughts about this in that study we don't have to pick it apart in detail but I thought it was kind of interesting it's all coming back to just moving the body as much as possible during the day Contracting muscles Contracting mus Contracting muscles it's medicine and I I find the concept of neat just endlessly fascinating you know because we we kind of come up with this term non-exercise activity thermogenesis and the data is really good about it like it's basically shows that this is a a prime potential intervention for the Obesity epidemic and it all goes back to the cell like it's a it's essentially a stimulus that's telling the body to stay metabolically active as opposed to keeping all those metabolic pathways you know dormant during the day um and I think that it just it is funny though that like we have these acronyms for basically like this is just the way life was a hundred years ago if you look at like the 1800s Almost 100% of Americans lived on a farm basically like pre-industrialization pre- urbanization most Americans not 100% but close lived they grew some of their own food they lived either on a farm or had a large garden now that number is less than 1% so like movement was just buil into everything we did and and you think from there like what has happened like we were outside we were moving our activities of daily living involved movement and if you just take the grocery example then it moved to like okay maybe farmers markets and sort of like you know outdoor open air markets then it's supermarkets then it's you know now it's literally buying food online with the click of the button and now some people aren't even doing that they're literally on the food delivered to them with Uber Eats so at every level we've taken away movement from everyday life and now we have sort of an acronym to like bring it back in but really it's about just you know giving the body stimulus stimuli that the cells have been entrained to expect throughout all of human history and building the back into our Modern Life so I think neat it's incredibly important and I think it also brings up this point that like is so critical which is like I really think our way out of this chronic disease epidemic and even for people who are listening don't have a chronic disease any real chronic symptoms we're dealing with and just the fact that we're not feeling as good as we could like the way out is pretty simple like it's it's some of these basic things like walking more throughout the day moving more throughout the day getting outside you know eating clean unpoisoned food the the a lot of these things that have the best data are so simple and I think it's like really important to just always remember like the game and the industry it's all about how complex can we make it like specialization talking about some of the minutia but like at the end of the day all the simple habits that we know are healthy like fundamentally improve cellular biology and like some of these things like the neat like the walking like it's emblematic of the fact that um some of the simplest Solutions are the ones that are by far the most effective and I think I think the biggest misconception in healthcare right now is that the way out and the way to get really back to to True incredible health is complicated like it's it's really not that complicated we we've got to move more you know throughout the day that's one of them and you know on each pillar that we touched on earlier food sleep all of this you know when we talk about the simple habits that know work the reason they work is because they all positively impact the mitochondria they positively impact oxy of stress they positively impact inflammation so yeah I love it I love Simple Solutions that hit multiple cellular Pathways that can make everybody healthier I'd like to just take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors insid tracker inside"}

It sounds something like a 20 hours of fasting, four hours of eating or 16 hours of fasting and eight hours of food intake, et cetera. But do you ever do longer fast, like 48 hours or 72 hours a week long, fast? - Occasionally I do. So my typical day I would only eat within a two hour window. Just usually I'm either eating out or. - 'Cause you're 22 too. - Yeah, but I love well. - And if you exercise, do you feel like you, then you just power through and maintain that fasted state? - Absolutely, I can exercise and now I've already so used to it. I don't feel like I need food after exercising, I used to. But have I gone longer? Yes, but not very often. I find it quite difficult to go more than 24 hours. But when I do it, maybe it's once a month, I'll go for two days after two and actually even better, if you go for three days without eating, it kicks in even greater longevity benefits. So there's a system called the autophagy system, which digests old and misfolded proteins in the body. And there's a natural cleansing that happens when you're hungry. Macroautophagy its name is but a good friend of mine, Ana Maria Cuervo at Albert Einstein College of Medicine discovered a deep cleanse called the chaperone mediated autophagy, which kicks in day two, day three, which really gets rid of the deep proteins. And what excites me is you just put out a big paper that said, if you trigger this process in an old mouse, it lives 35% longer. - Wow. - Yeah, so it's a big deal. If I could go longer, I would. But I just find that with my lifestyle and I'm going always day, 110% I need to eat at least once a day unfortunately. - One more practical question then a mechanistic question related to this, the practical question is when you are fasting, regardless of how long,"}

I should mention since many of you use caffeine and I use caffeine. I do drink coffee, I love mushroom coffee. I love mate. I drink caffeine and various forms. There was a study that came out recently that is relevant to our discussion about energy and alertness, and learning. And the study came out just recently March 2021, it's Maglhaes et al. So MAGALHAES. And it was published in molecular psychiatry which is a fine journal, a peer review journal. And the title pretty much gives it away, \"Habitual coffee drinkers display a distinct pattern of brain functional conductivity.\" Chronically drinking coffee changes brain conductivity. And it does it in a number of ways but the key takeaways from this study, as it relates to sort of what the circuits do as opposed to me just listing off a bunch of brain circuits, which is kind of meaningless in this conversation is that people who drank coffee habitually every day had changes in their brain circuitry, such that there was a shift or a bias toward anxiety even when they don't ingest caffeine. So a lot of times we think, Oh caffeine increases your levels of anxiety. And indeed it appears it does if you use it chronically, but not just to caffeine, it doesn't just raise your baseline of anxiety because of what circulating in your bloodstream. It actually increases connectivity between the brain areas that relate to anxiety. Now that could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on how you look at it. For people that have are prone to chronic panic attacks or anxiety attacks that's not going to be good. Some people might use caffeine in healthy ways. I believe I do in order to just increase overall levels of alertness. Although now not only am I going to start delaying my caffeine intake till two hours after I wake up for reasons I've talked about in previous episodes, but I'm also going to start drinking it later in learning and focus sessions as a way to enhance plasticity around those learning and focus sessions, not before. So interesting study, it's free online. You can access the full paper online, we will put a link as well. I want to mention this issue of nootropics,"}

That's a good question. I don't know the answer to that. LEX FRIDMAN: So there's two answers to that question. One is a suit and two is a black suit and black tie because I used to do-- I used to have more variety, which is like it was always a black suit but I would sometimes do a red tie and a blue tie. But that was mostly me trying to fit in to society because varieties-- you're supposed to have some variety. What inspired me at first was a general culture that doesn't take itself seriously in terms of how you present yourself to the world. So in academia, in the tech world, at Google, everybody was wearing pajamas and very relaxed. In the tech. I don't know how it is in the science, in the chemistry, biology, and so on. But in computer science everybody was very-- I mean, very relaxed in terms of the stuff they wear so I wanted to try to really take myself seriously and take every single moment seriously and everything I do seriously, and the suit made me feel that way. I don't know how it looks, but it made me feel that way. And I think, in terms of people I look up to that wore a suit that made me think of that is probably Richard Feynman. I see-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: He was a wonderful human being. LEX FRIDMAN: I see him as the epitome of class and humor and brilliance, and obviously I could never come close to that kind of-- be able to simply explain really complicated ideas and to have humor and wit, but definitely aspire to that. And then there's just the Mad Men, that whole era of the '50s, the classiness of that. There's something about a suit that both removes the importance of fashion from the character. You see the person. I think not to-- I forgot who said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel or somebody like this. Is that you wear a shabby dress and everyone sees the dress. You wear a beautiful dress and everybody sees the woman. So in that sense it was-- hopefully I'm quoting that correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good. LEX FRIDMAN: I think there's a sense in which a simple, classy suit allows people to focus on your character and then do so with the full responsibility of that, this is who I am. Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love that, and I love what you said just prior to that. My father, who, again, is always asking me why I don't dress formally like you do always said to me growing up, if you overdress slightly, at least people know that you took them seriously.

It's important to the function of the neuron. It's also important for the development of certain neurons, and there's a particular mutation, there are kids that are born without this sodium channel 1.7, if you want to look it up. Those kids experience no pain, no pain whatsoever, and it is a terrible situation. They burn themselves. They tend to rest on their limbs too long. They don't make the microadjustments. You might see me swiveling around in my chair, moving around a lot. Those microadjustments are actually normal, healthy microadjustments that prevent us from going into pain. They don't make those adjustments. They don't get the feedback that they're in a particular position and so they never make those adjustments and their joints get destroyed, essentially. They don't tend to live very long due to accidents. It's a really terrible and unfortunate circumstance. Some people have a mutation in the same channel where they make too much of this channel so they feel too much pain. In fact, it's reasonable to speculate that one of the reasons, not all, but one of the reasons why people might differ in their sensitivity to pain is by way of genetic variation in how many of these sorts of receptors that they express. People who make too much of this receptor experience extreme pain from even subtle stimuli. The good news is there are good drug treatments that can block specifically this sodium channel 1.7 and so those people get a lot of relief from taking such drugs. Pain and how much pain we are sensitive to or insensitive to probably has some genetic basis, and then of course, there are things that we can do to make sure that we experience less pain, although pain has this adaptive role. Let's talk about some of the features of how we're built physically and how that relates to pain and how we can recover from injury. First of all, we have maps of our body surface in our brain. It's called a homunculus. In a rat, believe it or not, I'm not making this up,"}

So this is also a great way to generate adrenaline if you do it a little bit intensely. So let's say you're feeling unmotivated to train, I don't particularly like doing endurance training until I'm actually doing it. So I use and benefit from having a practice where I'll just sit there and for about three minutes I'll just breathe very deeply trying to raise my chest as much as I can for maybe a minute, and then contracting my diaphragm and expanding my stomach outward when I inhale. By the end of that you're actually delivering more oxygen to your system. My lab has looked at this in a totally different context. Andy's lab has looked at it in the context of physical performance. So warming up the breathing muscles should make sense, given that you now know that muscles and neurons need glucose and they need oxygen in order to function. And so that's a great warmup. You can also do this while walking or while getting on the bike and starting to peddle, really starting to think about warming up the breathing system. And then you can decide if you want to do pure nasal or a combination of nasal and mouth breathing and so on. So that's something that we don't often hear about."}
{"question": "What are the recommended frequency and duration of static stretching for improving limb range of motion and general health benefits?", "doc_id": "tkH2-_jMCSk_15", "video_id": "tkH2-_jMCSk", "video_title": "Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols | Huberman Lab Podcast #76", "video_header": "Limb Range of Motion & General Health Benefits", "segment_idx": "15", "time_start": "1:19:20", "time_end": "1:25:25", "context": "doing something five days a week seems like a big commitment, even if that commitment is one to only do three sets of 30 second static stretches. I say this because you've got the warm-up, I generally like to bring a kind of a focus and dedication to a practice. And, of course, because when doing these kinds of protocols, it's likely that you're not just stretching your hamstring, so it's not just 90 seconds of work with a minute of rest in between, but very likely that we're also doing quadricep stretching, and also doing stretching for the shoulders, and stretching for the back, and the neck, and so on. And so, that entire session is going to take some time, and five days a week is a pretty serious commitment for most, especially for those of us that don't exercise or do athletics for a living, which I don't. So, there is some evidence from the literature that one can get away with, or I don't even know that we should think about it as getting away with, but that one can do longer hold static stretches of up to say 60 seconds, but do fewer total sessions per week. So, rather than three 30 second static holds, doing three 60 second static holds and doing those every other day. And there really hasn't been a systematic exploration of this. The article that I was referring to just a few moments ago, this analysis of the 23 articles was combined into this enormous set of tables and some really quite nice graphs that you're welcome to look at since we're going to provide a link to the study. There are a couple of key take aways that I want to mention that are separate from this issue of how long to stretch and how often. First of all, they describe in their discussion that there were improvements in range of motion independent of whether or not people did static stretching, active stretching, passive stretching, ballistic stretching, or PNF stretching. So, all of those forms of stretching will improve limb range of motion. This is essential to point out and I want to emphasize this. Static stretching, however, gave the greatest degree of gains in limb range of motion. And on average, they saw a 20.9% increase, but some of the other increases they observed were also quite substantial. So, ballistic stretching can also provide some pretty impressive limb range of motion improvements. However, they tended to be in the range of, here they point out, 11.65% increase, or in the case of PNF, a 15% increase. So, it appears that the greatest improvements in limb range of motion for your time spent and effort spent is going to be this minimum of five minutes per week to elicit a significant response with five days being the minimum weekly recommended frequency to achieve significant range of motion improvements. I confess, this was pretty surprising to me when I compare flexibility training to, say, resistance training for strength and hypertrophy. I've had the experience, and I know that other people have had the experience, and I think Dr. Andy Galpin would probably agree that provided one trains hard enough and appropriately that you don't need to train resistance training five days a week in order to get significant improvements in strength and hypertrophy. Some people might need to, but you can get a lot of positive results in those variables with less frequent training, certainly with three or four days a week of training. And for cardiovascular training, I'm not aware of anyone having tested whether or not one very long run each week can actually increase cardiovascular fitness and you're not doing anything else. Although, I have to imagine you'd probably see some improvement compared to not doing anything, but most people are doing repeated training sessions of cardiovascular strength training. Not a lot of people are doing five days a week of strength training, at least that I'm aware of. Some people are, but most people I think are not. And some people are doing five or more days a week of cardiovascular training. I'm guessing that most people are not doing five days a week of dedicated static stretch range of motion directed training, but it does appear that that frequency about the week getting those repeated sessions, even if they are short for an individual muscle group, turns out to be important. And so, that points to perhaps the reason why so few people are doing dedicated range of motion work, but it also reminds me that all of the studies that were described at least in this review and some of the other ones that were not really show impressive changes in limb range of motion. I mean, 20+%, or even 15% with PNF, I mean, these are big changes that are going to benefit us, they're going to offset the age-related losses in flexibility, for sure, if one is dedicated about these practices. And in many cases, they're going to increase limb range of motion in ways that are going to allow us better performance in certain physical endeavors, certainly better balance. All right, we haven't really talked about balance and stability, but range of motion can impair balance and stability in some extreme circumstances, but by and large, limb range of motion, lack of tightness, improved posture, improved physical performance, excuse me. And things of that sort is something that I think we can all benefit from, and that are key features of longevity. We don't often think of them because we so prioritize cardiovascular health and the relationship between the heart and brain health, and resistance training, and musculoskeletal hypertrophy, or strength, et cetera. But as I delved into this literature, it really highlighted for me the extent to which having really good limb range of motion, at least maintaining limb range of motion as we age from year to year, and maybe even improving limb range of motion can be immensely beneficial for reducing pain for, again, improving posture, improving our ability to perform, to walk, et cetera. And indeed, there's a whole literature that relates our limb range of motion to things like pain management of things related to headache and so on and so forth. So, limb range of motion is not just about becoming a contortionist or being able to complete the yoga class, it really is about maintaining the integrity and the health of the neuromuscular system, the connective tissue,"}
{"question": "What are some key rules or contingencies that young children, especially toddlers, learn about the world and themselves through play, and how do these rules shape their understanding of ownership and social interaction?", "doc_id": "BwyZIWeBpRw_4", "video_id": "BwyZIWeBpRw", "video_title": "Using Play to Rewire & Improve Your Brain", "video_header": "Childhood Play & Mindsets", "segment_idx": "4", "time_start": "23:57", "time_end": "29:16", "context": "Many of us, including myself, haven't played that much as adults. We're all pretty busy. Number of us are stressed. We got a lot to do in life, but as children, most all of us engage in a lot of play. And in looking at the way that very young children and especially toddlers play, we can learn a lot because it reveals the fundamental rules by which the toddler brain interacts with the world. Now, one of the key things about the baby brain is that the baby brain somehow knows that it can't do everything in the world, right? If a baby needs something, it generally will cry or make some sort of vocalization or some sort of facial expression or combination of those. And the caretaker, whoever that may be will provide it. This is an ancient hard wired mechanism whereby the so-called autonomic nervous system that generates stress will create this kind of whining and discomfort, maybe arriving, maybe the baby gets kind of red in the face and the caretaker delivers some thing based on a good guess of what that baby needs. So maybe it's breast milk, maybe it's bottle milk. Maybe it's a diaper change. Maybe it's to be warmed up if the baby is cold, maybe it's to be cooled down if the baby's too warm, maybe if the baby's in its a little onesie thing, it's feeling restricted and it just wants to move and they'll get taken out of their, their crib or their stroller, whatever it is and allowed to stretch out on the floor. Remember the baby doesn't know exactly what it needs. It only knows the state of discomfort. And of course we don't know exactly what babies and toddlers are thinking because they can't express themselves with language yet. But what's key to understand is the rule or the contingency that is set up in that scenario. In that scenario, the child feels some discomfort expresses that discomfort verbally or through a facial expression or both and then some force some person from the outside world resolves it. And so the very young baby and indeed many children up to certain ages and let's confess many adults are not able to meet or adjust their internal states of stress. And so they look to things outside of them. That's the first rule, the fundamental rule that we all learn when we come into life, that when in a state of discomfort to look outside our immediate biology, beyond the confines of our skin and find a solution, a sip of water for adults, it might be sip of alcohol, right? Probably not the best tool to relieve stress, but that's one that many people do. In fact engaging for the baby that's hungry. The bottle milk comes from the outside. As we gain more proficiency in moving through life and we can get things for ourselves. We still often bring things from the external world in to resolve this what I'm calling autonomic discomfort or autonomic dysregulation. That's not a game, but that's a rule. As we advance from infant to toddler, we start to think more in terms of where we are and what we own relative to what's out there in the world. And now in the world of child psychology, there's a somewhat famous poem that was written by a research child psychologist. His name was Burton White, and he wrote a poem called \"The Toddlers Creed\" \"The Toddlers Creed\" defines well, what the rules and contingencies of play are in very young children. And it reveals to us just how narrow and limited their world view is and how self entered their world is. So \"The Toddlers Creed\" read quickly, cuz' I don't want to take up too much time with this is. \"If I want it. It's mine. If I give it to you and change my mind later, it's mine.\" For anyone that's played with a toddler, you can imagine this in your mind. \"If I can take it away from you, it's mine. If I had a little while ago, it's mine. If we are building something together, all the pieces are mine. If it looks just like mine, it's mine. If it's mine, it will never belong to anyone else, no matter what.\" And of course, as we hear this sounds quite awful, right? And yet this is actually a reflection of what a healthy toddler would think about the world. That the objects and things, and even the people in the world are theirs, that they are actually possessions that belong to them. Now of course, some people never actually transition beyond this stage of moral and social development. And there are indeed some adults that fit \"The Toddlers Creed.\" And you're welcome to share this with them. If ever you think that it might be of benefit to their self-reflection. But in all seriousness Burton White's \"Toddlers Creed\" is really grounded in this transition from when we are infants. And we have to have things delivered to us, to the point where we are toddlers and we can access things in the world, but we tend to assume that they are all ours. And then the next stage is the really key stage as it relates to play because is in the next stage of development is where young children start to interact with other children and there's an exchange and a possession and then a letting go of certain things, learning that not everything is yours and that the entire world is not about you is one of the key contingencies that is established during play. It's one of the key way in which children go from being very self-centered and basically unable to engage with other kids for very long, without some sort of eruption of crying and some sort of battle of, you know, kind of push pull over an object to things like sharing and things like cooperative play."}

I discussed this with Dr. Galpin this morning, and I learned something very interesting, which is that hard bouts of exercise of the sort where you're training near failure or you're generating focused muscular contractions, for obsession that lasts anywhere from, I don't know, 30, 45 minutes, maybe 60 minutes or a long run where you're engaging in some interval training during that run, after exercise, there's a reduction in oxygenation of the brain. So there's actually a quite significant dip in the amount of oxygen that your neurons are getting and therefore your ability to think. So it's important that you control the intensity and the duration of your training sessions so that you're still able to do well in life and lean to life the way you need to, because I'm guessing most of you are not in a position to just prioritize your physical training you also need to use your minds.

more time outside are metabolically healthier and I think it's for pleotropic reasons but I think one of it is that it is the ultimate convincing of abundance and fundamental abundance in our world

us unhealthy it's fundamentally rooted in in scarcity and I think also when we realize we are part of nature again going back to that doubt statement we're a process not an entity realizing like you know all the trees around us and we take that walk even in a city we see all the trees all those plants all those leaves are making the oxygen that process that that literally let us do oxid of phosphorilation and that sun and that leaf on the tree the sun's energy is literally being stored in the carbon carbon bonds that the plants are generating in photosynthesis that ultimately all metabolism is is unlocking the potential energy stored from the sun to create the human energy that lets us love and move and live and think and do all the things we love to do and then it just becomes so obvious like of course we have to like eat real food and of course we have to not poison our soil with pesticides and of course we have to like you know care about the environment and we have to get outside and move and we have to be in the sunlight during the day because we are the environment we are a process that's constantly in Dynamic conversation with it and um I think I think a lot of people will find that their health gets a lot better if they spend radically more time outdoors and I think a lot of people might say well I can't I work on a computer and I'm like you know Rome is burning like we're sick as hell right now we need to get creative like move your computer outside take a walking meeting open your mail Outdoors chop your vegetables on your balcony at your apartment like we we have to find a way to connect back with our source understand that the world is abundant and harmonious uh reent the belief in our connection with nature and then let all of our dietary and lifestyle strategies stem from that sense of gratitude and awe and that will lead us right where we need to go which is um a really I think joyful experience of our health Journey um that's rooted fundamentally in connection rather than us being siloed from all of this which going back to the beginning of the conversation that's fundamentally what's wrong with the Healthcare System it's silos and we have siloed oursel from all of the life-giving things in our environment and that has ultimately leted us to be very very very sick and we've just I think we got to go back outside so that's one of the things but there there's many other things we can do to change those our relationship with fear but um we can't change the world as a whole but we can change what happens inside our body in terms of how we respond to it and for our mitochondria we have to we have to create a sense of safety in our bodies for our mitochondria to do the work we need them to do for health I love it and I love it for many reasons I I think um it was my I know it was my friend and former guest on this podcast Rick Rubin who several times early in our friendship he said um Back To Nature the only truth um and I asked him what he meant by that and you know cuz Rick can be a little bit um cryptic sometimes um not always but sometimes and what he was saying is you know it's a real thing you know you can immediately feel the connectedness between The Human Experience and um life of other types plants animals you know sunlight the circadian rhythms and the and the rhythms of the of light and dark um because they impact us so powerfully I mean if if there were ever a force in the world that impacts how we feel it's the Circadian rhythm it's the rising and setting of the sun it's um the impact of light and dark and then all the other things that you talked about today um I can't help but reflect on kind of your take on kind of what a lot of not all but a lot of U modern society attempts to do um it attempts to do a lot of good things too I believe I'm a Believer in technology um but that it if I were to translate it sounded like um what you were saying is that it gives us a sense of loss of control by instilling fear like we don't have control and then um there are a number of let's just call them programs in the world um that then sell back the illusion of some sense of agency little by little right a temporary agency and then puts you back into the cycle and there's something about going into nature which just um removes one from all of that at least temporarily gives you a more basic understanding of the relationship to self and things around us even just looking being able to see it to a distance we know is powerful for the the brain reducing anxiety we know being outdoors for 2 hours or more per day reduces myopia nearsightedness this is independent of all the other effects of of uh circadian rhythms Etc anyway and on and on so I second and third and um and uh here here all the um all the statements you made before I also just have to say I I really appreciate how you are able to tackle the cellular biology the molecular biology the macroscopic things that we can all do walking resistance training um cold exposure sleep um high-intensity interval training um and make make a case for each and all of those as it relates to the underlying biochemistry and weave all that together in a way that then uh you beautifully wrapped into this idea of connecting to Nature and not divorcing ourselves from Modern Life but really looking at the ways in which certain components of Modern Life are really making us sick not just the the behaviors not just the dos and the don'ts that it's kind of imparting on us but also so kind of the psychology around it it's uh that it is quietly but powerfully oppressive is is the message that I'm getting and that we have to take a stand against it and the way to take a stand against it is to do what are very um basic and fairly easy to access things making better choices about food timing quality amount exercise and on and on so so I'm running long in my response to your much more eloquent description of mindset uh but what I want to say is on behalf of myself and everyone listening I so appreciate we appreciate the work that you're doing to be a medical doctor specialized in one of these silos and then to take a step out and say nope not me I'm going to do what I see as best for the greater good in terms of giving people tools giving people a sense of agency and autonomy to take control of their health this is in some ways a heretical idea um but luckily the numbers of folks like you are growing and you're a real leader in this field um by example and by the incredible work you're doing with technology and information sharing love love love the book I did go through it um front to back um I haven't tried the recipes yet but thank you for bringing the blueberries I'll try the recipes um at least one of them and um I just want to thank you for sharing what you do and um for continuing to do what you do we we need it and we appreciate it so thank you thank you thank you for joining me for today's discussion about metabolic function with Dr Casey mean"}
{"question": "Can a dynamic hierarchy with subordinates and dominants, where individuals are ranked based on their skills and abilities, lead to more productive and sustainable groups, and how can we, as researchers, encourage and train individuals to take on leadership roles and assume responsibility?", "doc_id": "V0Sdgn0_kFM_17", "video_id": "V0Sdgn0_kFM", "video_title": "Dr. Kay Tye: The Biology

to be super interesting I grew up in a big pack of mostly boys um that's just kind of how it worked out in my neighborhood um at the time um and it was very interesting because it was very clear it was a dynamic hierarchy where if we were skateboarding certain kids were Alpha if we were playing soccer other kids were Alpha if we were doing anything artistic um if it was uh kind of geeky knowledge and and nerdy stuff um you know then you know might have been somebody else who had the knowledge um and had the information that people wanted so I think Dynamic hierarchies are really interesting and I think um get us out of that sort of more standard Alpha like kind of chest beating telling everyone what to do dictatorial model I mean and this is now fully out of any science land and into speculation opinion land but I think that type of structural structure where when you're doing different tasks different individuals become the alpha or the leader because it's based on compet is very healthy I think structures where you have locked down this is the this is the hierarchy where someone's the boss of you because of this one skill but there's all these other skills that they're not as they're they're not Superior you know they they they don't don't outrank you at and and so how do you work all of that out and so I think that's also something about keeping score like what is what is the rank right and so we did this experiment where we designed a task um animals are trained that a queue predicts reward delivery only one animal can get at a time it's just a very narrow place so if one animal's getting it you can't get it then um we would have four animals that are CAG mates four mice that are CAG mates and we would have two of them do get out at each point and they we know the ranks the ranks are stable they have a rank one two three four in the cage and everybody does a round robin ones versus twos ones versus threes twoos versus yeah they well they they do round robin in this reward competition task they're food deprived you know and we we present rewards what's the what happens and so subordinates do win some of the times even though dominants win more all you know they they consistently win more and we found that prefrontal cortical neurons you could represent very stably and decode which animal was dominant um flat regardless of the trial and then when you looked at whether we could decode competitive success meaning who is going to win that next trial so there's a new trial every 30 or 40 seconds and so but 30 seconds before which is as far as we can measure because then we're like kind of into the previous trial as soon as the last trial ends even before the next trial ends You can predict above chance significantly which animal is going to win the next trial just based on the firing pattern of prefrontal cortical so you can predict winners and losers you can predict and understand where they are in the hierarchy as well based on the ACT activation of neurons prior to the battle like recording from the um by analogy it's like recording from the prefrontal cortex of two let's say business competitors or um martial arts competitors and you can predict who's going to win based on the pattern of firing in their brains prior to the competition that's right and so um that suggests all sorts of things number one it doesn't mean these competitions are not independent there's something about the state of the animal and when we looked at is it just whoever won the previous trial that did not account for this and so um I thought this was really interesting but when you look at the decoding accuracy for dominance versus subordinates about uh who will win the next trial for dominance it stays pretty flat it just has to do with I think this is my speculation of our data um that you know they they either are engaged or they're not engaged the subordinates the decoding accuracy is it's above it's above chance but then it shoots up somewhere around closer to the queue presentation and so my speculation about that is that the subordinates are looking at the dominance they're looking the dominant doesn't look like they're it doesn't look like they're going to go for it okay yeah they there looks like they're turning away I'm gonna go I'm gonna go so it's it's not like they're both going out full every time it's it's a calculation which trials oh he's not paying attention you know it's like when you're driving in traffic and you're trying to find the the moment to cut over and you're waiting for the person who's like te texting and they're just there's a big space and then everybody's just getting in right here you know you can just see you're like looking for clues about the state of level you know of competition and then and then the dominants they are not looking at the subordinate they're just doing whatever they feel like doing it's like uh there's uh I think there's that one scene in Madmen where something happened in the work environment and um and it was clear someone's account didn't sell or something didn't work out for one person versus the other and I think one of the characters says to uh Don Draper who's clearly one of the alpha was in that work environment by virtue of yeah role and and um position um says you know you know I sometimes think about the way that you blank blank blank and blank and he goes on this brief tiate about how upset he was and um and Draper says well I don't think about you at all and then the elevator I believe closes and it really cemented his status in the office as somebody who's really not paying much attention to what other people are doing he's just making decisions according to what's going to be best for the firm in some cases for himself and in some cases both so I think that's essentially what you're talking about yeah I think it's um it's kind of the nature of the structure that's what makes you the alpha is you're you you have you have other things that are occupying your attention and your your Visionary status hopefully if you're you know a productive successful Alpha and for a sustainable you know group and then everyone else is they don't they don't need to have the big picture they don't they don't you know it it becomes the reinforcement schedule is different I'm just looking for validation am I am I playing my role okay it's a very different mindset I think you know as a scientist when you're a trainee sometimes you're a supporting member on a team where you're getting instruction someone's telling you what to do versus the moment where you get your own project and maybe you're working by yourself maybe there's no one to command but no one's telling you what to do that is to me one of the biggest thresholds to step over when you're becoming a scientist or an investigator is the first time where you just do something and like try and experiment no one told you to do and it feels super weird it feels like you're sneaking around or something and and then you know I think I think um in today's mentorship chain sometimes that that happens too late I think if we could have that experience happen earlier um I think that would only be good for for the future of research I agree I was very fortunate that my graduate adviser um told me look I'm going to help you but I'm going to have two kids while you're in the lab and I'm not going to be around a lot so you're going to have to figure it out don't burn the lab down don't kill yourself with any of the poisons in the lab and then my post talk adviser um the late and great Ben Baris um largely treated the postdocs as as Junior professors from an early stage and I remember thinking he can't control the experiments I'm going to do this is up to me and he and and a great number of us who were training with him at that time went on to have our own lab so I think um uh there's really something important to that model and of course we're discussing the research field but um this could be exported to any number of different fields because what those mentors were essentially training us to do was to um to assume the role that we would eventually have as opposed to be subordinates um do you watch chimp Empire so actually um just this week yet yesterday and the day before before this uh an postto interview who worked with the Chimp on chimp Empire visited and interviewed him in my lab and um talked about his work so I have not seen chimp Empire but it's at the very top of my to-do list oh God it's so good I don't want to spend the next 20 minutes talking about it but you see all sorts of interesting um Behavior very relevant human behavior hierarchies yes but also um altruistic behavior um allopathic grooming I mean in in chimp culture um as I've learned from the show assuming it's accurate um that who Grooms who is very important um and there's all sorts of interesting um Maneuvers that subordinates make and there's all sorts of interesting displays of vigor that the alpha makes to remind people that they are the alpha and then as they age or make mistakes Stakes of judgment the subordinates also will feain deference they'll be like oh yeah you're the alpha you're really tough and secretly they're plotting to replace the alpha um so whether or not we're talking about a scene from Mad Men or we're talking about chimp Empire we're talking about Research Laboratories or um or any other landscape kindergarten I think these circuits are active in all of us and the sooner that we uh acknowledge those and try and find um ones that generalize to the the goodness of as many uh members as possible um we're not doing our task but clearly you're doing the task so okay social rank is something that uh we need to acknowledge no doubt um which actually leads me to what might seem like a desperate topic but um one that I"}

can be done to reduce one's risk of cancer well you asked earlier about the numbers so let's throw some numbers out there right so globally we're talking about 11 12 million deaths per year about half the number of uh ascvd still a staggering number um at the individual level put it this way somewhere between 1 and three and one and four chance anyone listening to this or watching is going to get cancer in their lifetime but what's the probability they will die from that that about a one in six chance of dying okay so is it true that every male gets prostate cancer most in other words on their death bed every man will die with prostate cancer and some will die from it got you you and I have prostate cancer right now thank you for informing me yes uh hopefully we will not die of it we should not die of it prostate cancer colon cancer are Cancers that no one should ever die from because they are so easy to screen for they are so easy to treat when they are in their infancy um that it's totally unacceptable that people are dying from this there are other cancers for which I can't really say that breast cancer much more complicated pancreatic cancer much more complicated gasto multiform much more complicated so there you know as you said a second ago cancer is not a disease it is a category of diseases each it's not just that each organ is different and breast differs from pancreatic it's that within breast cancer erpr positive her two new positive is a totally different disease from the triple negative breast cancers those with braam mutations or non- braam mutations well even putting that aside just looking at the the hormone profile of the individual breast cancers they're totally different diseases so it's not just that breast cancer is different from prostate cancer it's that all breast cancers are quite different maybe I should frame the question a little differently than given the vast number of different types of cancers and categories Within your question is still a fair one I just wanted to throw that caveat out there so now to your question okay so what do we know it turns out that we can very comfortably speak to um several things one is the role that genes play so um maybe I'll just spend one second on a gene 101 thing for for the for the viewer we want to differentiate between what are called germline mutations and sematic mutations so um your germ line and my germ line are set when we were born our germ line mutations uh any mutations we have in germline genes are inherited from our parents it they're non-negotiable non-negotiable you got those things so question one is how much of cancer results from those types of genetic mutations and the answer is very little less than 5% so very now you mentioned one a moment ago braa okay so so mutations in braa are germline mutations a woman will get a braa mutation from one of her parents and we will often have a sense of that just from the family history you know when mom and sister and aunt and grandmother had breast cancer you've got a breast cancer Gene now it might be braa it might be another Gene that's not braa but there's no ambiguity and we test for these genes mostly just for insurance purposes frankly but there's no ambiguity that that was a germline transmission of a gene that is driving cancer but 95 plus percent of cancers are not arising from germline mutations they are arising from sematic mutations or acquired mutations so the question then becomes what is driving sematic mutation and the two clearest indications of drivers of sematic mutation are smoking and obesity smoking we've talked about let's put that aside for a moment I'm so surprised about obesity I don't know why I'm surprised but I've um never heard this I'm probably just naive to the literature yeah so obesity is now the second most prevalent environmental driver of cancer now I will argue and I think I argue this in the book hopefully pretty convincingly I don't think it's obesity per se I think obesity is just a masquerading proxy what is obesity obesity simply is defined by body mass index well first of all uh I don't think I'm obese but I'm I'm way overweight on BMI you probably are too so you know let's just acknowledge I'm clinically diagnosable as obese are you oh no well not well clinically BMI over 30 I don't think you're probably there no but if I if if I measure my weight by height um you know my BMI is probably 27 or 28 okay it's been a little while since I've checked I I can I only know body fat percentages and things like that so so so basically like BMI is a far from perfect proxy but at the population level it's what we use um I wish we would get off it by the way I think it's really crap because it doesn't take into account lean versus I think we could get I think we could get better data if we looked at waste to height ratio that's a way better metric so this is just a quick test for everybody it's I don't I I'm going to argue your BMI is less relevant to me than your eye color but if your waist circumference is more than 50% of your height you should be concerned okay well then I'm okay yeah you're fine by that metric right but that's important so if you're six feet tall your waist better be under 36 in and if it's over I would argue that's the definition of obesity not your BMI being over 30 so um back back to this issue because we're using such a crude measurement it basically is catching a whole bunch of stuff but the question is what's driving it and I think if you really look at the physiology of cancer I don't think it's obesity I think it's two things that come with obesity insulin resistance which is you know 2/3 to 3/4 of obese individuals are insulin resistant and inflammation and I think those two things with the inflammation and the immune dysfunction with the insulin resistance and the hyper basically tonic growth stimulus that's coming that's what's driving cancer so again is it because a person is storing extra fat you know and their love handles that that's driving their risk of cancer no that that's those are just two things that are coming along for the ride so beyond those two things and along with C we also certain environmental toxins we absolutely know are doing this right so we understand that people who you know have exposure to asbestos have a much higher risk of certain types of lung Cancers and things like that but for the most part um those are our big risks beyond that we talk about alcohol in certain cases absolutely um alcohol is a carcinogen um it's the dose part still isn't clear to me I don't know is one drink a day moving the needle much on cancer risk per se it's not clear and it might depend on those uh genetic predispositions yes so so yeah if Step One is don't get cancer you have no control over your genes you have control over smoking you have control over insulin sensitivity I wish I could sit here and tell you that there is a proven anti-cancer diet or that if you do x amount of exercise per weak you're going to not get cancer we just don't have a fraction of the control over cancer that we have with cardiovascular disease we we don't understand the disease well enough so we don't understand kind of the initiation process and the propagation process um and we you know we we have to rely much more on screening are there good whole body screens for cancer uh in other"}
{"question": "What types of activities or sports can help a highly competitive person engage in play while still allowing them to experience the benefits of neuroplasticity and low adrenaline levels?", "doc_id": "BwyZIWeBpRw_16", "video_id": "BwyZIWeBpRw", "video_title": "Using Play to Rewire & Improve Your Brain", "video_header": "Competition & Dynamic Movement", "segment_idx": "16", "time_start": "1:23:26", "time_end": "1:27:29", "context": "So if you're like me, you might be thinking, okay, I'm willing to be more playful. I'm willing to explore, play as a portal to plasticity. And that all makes good sense, but what should I play? What should I do? Well, we've already established that you want to keep your adrenaline low. You have to keep the stakes slow enough that you're not going to get totally consumed by the outcome. Now, for some people who are highly competitive, that's going to be challenging. And yet I don't want to make it seem as if you can't be competitive during play. There are many forms of competitive play that because you are a competitive person, allow you to drive great joy from that competitive play. I have a friend who's particularly good at horseshoes. I'm not particularly good at horseshoes, but whenever we play horseshoes, I can tell he's out there to crush me on horseshoes. And it's just one of these things where, you know, I can tell he derives great pleasure from crushing me at a game of horseshoes. I can't say because I haven't actually done the microdialysis, which is a way of extracting chemistry from the brain in real time, nor have I recorded from his brain or image it in a scanner, whether or not he has high levels of epinephrine or low levels of epinephrine. During those games of horseshoes, I suspect his low levels of epinephrine and high levels of dopamine, especially when he wins. And he has, he wins every time. But the win is that you can be competitive during play, provided that you were enjoying yourself. Okay, you can be competitive provided that you were enjoying yourself. There are particular forms of play that lend themselves best to neuroplasticity. And those particular forms of play again, are not designed to necessarily just engage the plasticity that allows you to perform that behavior, but rather to expand the number of possibilities for your brain to change in general throughout life and the two major forms of those for which there's good Peer Reviewed Research is to engage in novel forms of movement, including different speeds of movement. So let's say for instance, you're somebody who runs. I happen to like running. I try and run three times a week. And generally when I run, I run forward, I don't run backward, although recently, because I've become very excited about the work of so-called \"Knees Over Toes Guy,\" his name is Ben Parker, but he goes by \"Knees Over Toes Guy\" on Instagram. I've never met him, but we've exchanged a few messages back and forth. And some of his practices involve walking backwards or doing sled poles backwards. I found these to be very beneficial for my back and for my, you know, interior tibialis and some things that have really helped with my posture and so forth. But in general, when I run, I run forward, I don't tend to run backward that much. And I might do that for a few minutes at the end, but not so much throughout the entire run. Running doesn't lend itself to a lot of novel forms of movement, lateral movements. So for the nerds out there movement in the Sagittal plane or angled movements, but it does appear that things like dance or sports where you end up generating a lot of dynamic movements where there's jumping, where there's movement at different angles, where there's ducking, where there's leaping, that basically involve a lot of dynamic movement. And aren't just strictly linear. Those seem to open the portals for plasticity. And that's because they mimic a lot of the brain circuitry that is associated with play. And the reason for that is the way in which those dynamic movements and movements of different speeds engage the vestibular system. The balance system, the vestibular system is in the inner ear, relates to the cerebellum, which translates the mini brain. You got a little mini brain in the back of your brain. It brings together visual information in a very direct way. I talked a lot about this in the episode on how to learn faster. So if you want to go in depth on how vestibular and different types of motor movements can open plasticity, I talk a little bit more, I should say a lot more there, but suffice to say that engaging in play that has a lot of dynamic movement or movements of different speeds, things like dance, things like sports, like soccer where you're moving in different dimensions. That tends to be very conducive to what we would call play related circuitry provided you don't take it too seriously. You don't get those high levels of epinephrine."}

somewhere around 6:30 p.m. but and I go to sleep somewhere around 8:30 900 p.m. in an Ideal World sometimes I go to sleep a bit later uh sometimes I eat a little bit later it's just you know there's some variability with these but um put differently what is the relationship between food intake and Sleep Quality in terms of timing of food intake and then perhaps we can talk a little bit about um food macronutrients it's very interesting there was somewhat of a Dogma out there that we have to stop eating you know three or 4 hours before bed for optimal sleep if you look at the data the data is quite a spread no pun intended there is there are some people for whom that works very well and if they eat even two hours before bed they just get disrupted in terms of their sleep some of that is about people just feeling too full and not feeling comfortable other aspects are that when you become recumbent when you lie down you have a higher risk of gastric reflux coming back up and therefore you get heartburn and that's pretty miserable and people will describe that too by way of closer proximity of food intake relative to when you're falling asleep nevertheless if you look at the data and I I did a recent very deep dive on this personally myself about 12 months ago it's not quite as Extreme as the Dogma makes out if you eat 2 hours before bed on average it doesn't seem to necessarily harm your sleep now that's very different than saying what is best to improve or enhance your sleep but the way these studies were designed it was looking at detriments they then went to 90 minutes before sleep onset and even there there didn't seem to be Market impermanence 60 Minutes you started to see maybe some signs but on average the effect size was somewhat weak but then when you get close to sort of 45 minutes or so then things did start to deteriorate I think it depends hugely on your chronotype and also just on your appetite Cadian Rhythm preferences too I am someone who I do not feel very hungry when I first wake up in the morning I don't feel very hungry throughout most of the day and I will onboard most of my calories probably in the hours probably in about a 4H hour period maybe less even 3-hour period and then I will cut myself off about 90 minutes before sleep so I classically I would have been considered as you know violating this sleep dogma of of cutting yourself off at least three hours I think it's very personal though just experiment with it you will know the situation um as for macros and specific food components the data is a little bit mixed certainly what we know is that if you're eating a diet that is high in sugar and low in protein your sleep is worse why would that be the case well one of the reasons that we think is that if you onboard sugar it can be somewhat metabolically active and when it becomes metabolically active it can increase your body temperature your core body temperature even just for very subtly but that's enough to disrupt your sleep as we spoke about with temperature but I think in terms of really the you know what would be the ideal macron nutrient and even micronutrient um dietry recommendation that I would have for you I don't think we have enough data yet above and beyond that that statement um yeah yeah I I've experienced um when I eat a very low carbohydrate diet which I've experimented with in the past maybe even even full ketogenic diet for for brief periods of time although I'm an omnivore so I eat meat and eggs and I also eat starches pastas rice Etc um but we know based on beautiful work from for example Chris Palmer from from Harvard Medical School uh who is a guest on this podcast I listen to that it was great podcast yeah Chris is is spectacular and and U has advocated the exploration of ketogenic diets for the treatment of various psychiatric conditions not all but psychiatric conditions and and it seems and he agreed with me on this that when people go on very low starch very low carbohydrate diets that sometimes they can experience a bit of hypomania some people can and challenge this with sleep and um sometimes there are psychiatric reasons why um people stay on those diets anyway and then they have to do other things to encourage their sleep by their pharmacology or supplementation or some combination but I I can say anecdotally for myself if I if I don't eat starches for a extended amount of time a couple of days I find it very hard to get quality sleep as indicated by Sleep trackers um and uh and just uh sleep late latency to fall asleep is longer than it is ETC um so i' I've opted to eat most of my carbohydrates Ates later in the evening um which and violates you know every rule of you know eat your carbs early in the day and and and I think there are some data to support that eating carbohydrates early in the day may actually um have certain benefits for weight maintenance or weight loss so I realized that but those aren't my my goals at the moment weight maintenance yes weight loss no so I think um I certainly feel after eating a dinner that has a bit more starch pasta rice these things of that sort and a little bit lower protein as opposed to the inverse like eating a couple couple of riy steaks and a salad but no starch that um my sleep is substantially better um and I always uh attributed that to the relationship between some of the starches and the tryptophan serotonin pathway yeah there is some data on that with the carbohydrate intake in the evening and of course that that tryptophan and that carbohydrate intake um will contain the precursor ingredients to something else that we've spoken about which is melatonin and so that may actually help healthily boost that melatonin signal and there's a little bit of data on that to supported to we also did a study where we um we were looking at night to night to night sleep and carbohydrate intake the next day and it did seem to support what you're describing in terms of some of the carbohydrate benefits we also found a strange result that was almost the opposite prediction that we made carbohydrate intake in the morning to equally help people wake up and we were a little bit uncertain as to why but we're going to go into more detail the reason that you mentioned the the suggestion of not take on carbs in the evening is in part based on the evidence that your body's ability to dispose of sugar and obviously when you're eating carbohydrate you can have a higher um Spike of sugar now that in part depends on what you're eating with that carbohydrate and also of course the nature of that carbohydrate whether it's simple or whether it's complex whether it's simple sugars versus you know complex more um starchy uh carbohydrate but the idea is that your body even if you were to eat the same amount of carbohydrate in the morning in the afternoon or in the evening same carbohydrate dose and type but your body's ability to dispose of that without having excessive spikes of glucose is worse in the evening better in the morning I.E if you're concerned about your blood sugar um and your metabolic Health maybe that's what you should do I think that that data is unclear on the basis of if you are um glycemic normal meaning that you currently do not have signs of type two two diabetes or you're not pre-diabetic then that may not necessarily be the case and so I think that's why it could be you know beneficial for you and I know that you've um you think deeply about that and and um I've even been tracking blood sugar as well I don't have any signs of that but I'm just fascinated by some of that data and how it interacts with my sleep because I'm a a sleep nerd so I think right now we just don't have plentiful data to recommend a particular sleep quote unquote diet for improved optimization I would say though that we can be a little bit more relaxed about the timing of our food earlier you mentioned C caffeine and caffeine is a topic that we get into"}

who's you know been in photobiology um albe a slightly different realm you know the effects of light um and the incredible changes that it can have in biology most of what we understand for lasers in medicine came out of Dermatology studies you know a lot of the understanding of laser biology came out of the Wellman Institute over at Harvard where many of my colleagues are and we now know that certain laser devices certain resurfacing devices not only app improve the appearance of your skin clinically they reduce your risk of skin cancer by 20% maybe greater and even more amazingly is when you do microarray Gene studies they actually activate the genes of more youthful healthy skin cells that were quiescent as we age so there's genetic verification clinical verif verification and aesthetic verification these things are awesome now laser is a big umbrella term some of the devices we use are not lasers they're actually light Broadband light or uh intense pulse light some of them are laser some of them are uh ablade some of them are nonablative and we get into the nuances of these things but there are a few lasers that have been shown to make these dramatic differences so if you're interested I mean see a see an expert so this would be go to your dermatologist ask for some is it laser resurfacing yeah yeah so laser resurfacing it tends to be and what's really popular there's two forms of laser resurfacing there's what we call nonablative meaning it doesn't burn or vaporize the top layer of skin and then there's ablative resurfacing which vaporizes the top layer of skin obviously ablative ones are much more aggressive much more effective a lot more downtime and a lot of riskier because you're literally peeling the face off or any part of the body and it regrows without any scarring that's also the another beauty of the skin is you can literally peel it off entirely and have it regrow as if nothing ever happened so people have this done once a year or so yeah for for not for a blade of resurfacing it's like once every five years or so on it's it's pretty dramatic and how long is the downtime for a blade of resurfacing uh two weeks usually two weeks you're pretty raw and sore it's fallen out of favor in most big cities because of the downtime and the inherent risks but it's still used in the right patient nonablative resurfacing meaning it doesn't vaporize the top layer but drills holes into the dermis and targets certain parts of the epidermis without causing burn injury that's become much more popular because the downtime is markedly less people can go back to work and enjoy their activities while having pretty much the same benefits albeit a little bit less than a blade of lasers these we generally recommend annually or biannually depending on what you're trying to Target a large Harvard study just came out that showed that non-ablative fractionated laser resurfacing particularly with a device called fraxel actually Cuts your skin cancer risk by 20% because it eliminates those mutations and gets rid of those cells that had been collecting the stuff it's amazing how is this different than exfoliating skin like if one were to just try and um you know scrape away some of the dead skin through some you know semi vigorous buffing of the skin with a like a sponge I've never done I've never done either of these procedures like I said my skincare routine is very basic it's the unscented Dove soap the shower once or twice a day and your skin looks great so keep doing what you're doing I mean I feel pretty good I mean I I think um you know sleep seems to play a significant role uh for me um I do get probably a bit more sun exposure than most people I'm conscious of checking for skin Cancers and we'll talk about that um because those do run in my family um but and I try and eat right and exercise right haven't consumed much alcohol in my lifetime so look your skin will tell you if something's wrong so that's the first line now you talk about you know dermabrasion or microdermabrasion the good old St Ives apricot scrub that every dermatologist you know frowns upon but ironically I use myself after a heavy workout at the beach and I'm all greasy but don't you know don't get mad at me for using that stuff the depth is key so when we do microdermabrasion or some sort of dermabrasion the only thing we're really scraping off is really the stratum corneum which is the highest layer of skin cells that don't even have a nucleus they're dead skin cells that's all you're scraping off whereas lasers Target through the epidermis and into the dermis and you control for that depth and what you control for is the amount of heat energy delivered to that depth to Target a certain thing so in theory what you describe in terms of dermabrasion is the same premise the old school ablade of lasers do they just fry everything off and you grow new skin and in frying everything off it fries off sun damage wrinkles precancers and skin cancers but in doing that you're a bloody mess for a few weeks not popular for many reasons but very effective we did a ton of this at Stanford and we did a ton of the other one at Stanford in my practice I do a lot of laser work as well the nonablative stuff picks and chooses that was the beauty of ident learning about laser and photobiology is how we target a certain structure and avoid damaging all the other ones that the theory of selective photothermolysis that came out of rock Anderson's lab at Harvard that was the game changer we can now pick any appendage in the skin and find a way to Target it and leave the rest undisturbed so if you have broken blood vessels you decide to use bpc 157 and it work great and the blood vessels started to grow and you're like I don't like the look of them there is a laser that targets solely blood vessels is that the IPL laser IPL is okay IPL stands for intense pulse light it's somewhat effective but not very effective the the gold standard is what we call the pulse die laser or the vbeam laser and that is a 595 nanometer laser that targets oxyhemoglobin I've had that actually because I had an an angioma yeah had it three times and the third time they hit this thing it went away but not without a very significant bruise lasting almost a month a like you know I mean it was pretty dramatic done it right but it did eliminate the the vessel that was very by any means necessary right it's just new"}
{"question": "Do humans have a similar mechanism as ground squirrels and marmots to generate heat during hibernation, using specialized brown fat?", "doc_id": "77CdVSpnUX4_27", "video_id": "77CdVSpnUX4", "video_title": "Dr. Craig Heller: Using Temperature for Performance, Brain & Body Health", "video_header": "Studies of Bears & Hibernation, Brown Fat", "segment_idx": "27", "time_start": "1:26:56", "time_end": "1:31:08", "context": "- The true hibernation? - Well, it depends on how you define true. A bear, actually, we've done a lot of work on bears. - Do you also put the nose thermal couple down in the esophagus? - We implant them surgically. - They're anesthetized when you implant them? - Yes. - Khat kind of bears are these? - Black bears. - Okay. - And did this with colleagues at University of Alaska. And we're analyzing the data now, but what we've done is we've had now a total of 18 bears and we implant them with EEG, EKG, temperature sensors, and sometimes we actually measure their oxygen consumption. - These are bears in the wild? - These are bears in the wild, but they're brought in to University of Alaska where we keep them in an outdoor enclosure. So they're hibernating in a nest box in an enclosure, and we're recording this electrophysiological data continuously for six months. - Amazing. How do I get on this protocol? [Andrew chuckling] Craig and I are doing some work together going forward. And maybe you can slide me onto this protocol too, it sounds amazing. - Right now, it's a matter of just analyzing the gigabytes, terabytes of data that have been collected. But anyway, you asked about hibernation. So bears only go down to about 33, 34 degrees centigrade in core temperature. And that's been argued that, well, they can't go lower because they have so much insulation. They're so big, their surface volume ratio, and so forth, and that's not true. They shiver, so if we have a day like a minus 40, which you get up in Alaska, they will go through periods of shivering. And maintain a core temperature on 33-34. Now the ground squirrels and the marmots, which are smaller animals, they will drop down to a body temperature maybe within a degree of the environment. So they can go down to one or two degrees centigrade just above freezing during bouts of hibernation. So they'll stay in hibernation for seven or eight days and they'll come back up to normal body temperature for a day, then they'll go back down, and do another about- - What do they do during that day when they're warming up again? Do go around- - They rearrange their nests, eat, if they've stored food. Some species store lots of food. Others just depend on their fat. - A former mentor of mine, my master's degree mentor, and a colleague and friend of yours, Irving Zucker at UC Berkeley told me a story once, told me a lot of stories, he tells great stories, as you know. He told me that when an animal comes out of hibernation periodically, that it's a very dramatic thing to observe. That it's not like they wake up and yawn and look around, but it's like a complete epileptic seizure. - Right. - What what's going on? - Shiver. - It's just a very traumatic shiver. - So at the low temperatures, they cannot shiver because the effect of temperature on the conduction of the nerves and the muscle fiber. - So they're shut down basically? - They're shut down. So there they use brown fat. So they activate brown fat and then when they get up to a temperature of maybe 15, 16 degrees centigrade, then the shivering starts and it gets very, very violent, but they're still asleep. - Do we shiver in our sleep? - I would imagine we do, but it probably wakes us up. - Interesting, So the brown fat is kind of like kindling? - The brown fat is a tissue which has lots of stored energy, 'cause it's fat, but unlike our white fat, our regular fat, it also has lots of these little powerhouses, mitochondria, and lots of blood supply. So essentially it is a tissue just to produce heat. That's what it's there for. Now in these hibernators, there are big patches of brown fat at certain locations that are critical, like around the heart, for example. For us, the brown fat is sort of distributed. So for many, many years, it was thought humans don't have brown fat, but indeed we do. It's just not localized into discrete fat pads, like it is in ground squirrels, marmots. - I don't know why the phrase fat pads is so satisfying to say, but it is fat pads. Speaking of fat pads, I was taught that we have,"}

He's a world expert in thermal regulation. It's very clear that that's the wrong response to try and cool off the body. If you put a cold towel or you put an ice pack on the back of the neck, what you effectively do is cool the blood that's going to the brain. And if you do that, then your brain will react by turning up the crank in so to speak on the neurons in the pre optic area, and will heat you up further and can cook your brain and organs further. So what you want to do is, as I've talked about before, you want to cool the bottoms of the feet, the palms of the hands and the upper part of the face. And I'm not going to go into all the details as to why you want to do that right now, but those are the locations you want to cool. Now you can also cool the rest of the body, but it's not okay to just stay under the covers and just cool, you know, the neck or something like that. You really want to try and create a systemic or whole body cooling, if the goal is to bring fever down, but in many cases, fever is adaptive. And so taking a non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs like Advil and Tylenol sometimes can be good, if that's recommended, but other times, because it reduces your fever, it's allowing that pathogen, that pyrogen, it's sometimes called, a pyrogen is a substance that causes fever, think pyro, think fire, think pyromaniacs, think pyro, those pyrogens can survive at moderate to low temperatures, and they can't survive at high temperatures. So the fever is an adaptive mechanism and the OVLT, and the sensing of your chemistry is how the OVLT, organum vasculosum of the lateral terminalis does that. So we've talked about sensing lung volume,"}
{"question": "What is the optimal time frame for eating, considering the body's natural fasting periods during sleep, and how long should I wait after waking up to start eating again?", "doc_id": "9tRohh0gErM_11", "video_id": "9tRohh0gErM", "video_title": "Effects of Fasting & Time Restricted Eating on Fat Loss & Health | Huberman Lab Podcast #41", "video_header": "When to Start & Stop Eating", "segment_idx": "11", "time_start": "41:38", "time_end": "45:31", "context": "Is it early in the day, the middle of the day or later in the day? And how long should that eating window be? Should it be eight hours? We already heard why the eight hour window was first established. It was because of these lab conditions and the conditions of the particular relationship of the graduate student involved, or should it be seven hours or six hours or 12 hours. It turns out that there's some general frameworks that we can follow in order to answer these questions. As we move into this portion of the discussion, I want to highlight a very important reference that just came out, literally came out last week in the journal endocrinology reviews. And the title of this review is time-restricted eating for the prevention and management of metabolic diseases. Although the data in this paper go well beyond metabolic diseases, this is a paper from Satchin Panda's lab. It's a very lengthy review with an enormous table that's beautifully organized that scripts out all the studies done in humans. Well over a hundred studies looking at time, restricted feeding in athletes, men, women, children, diabetes, no diabetes, et cetera, with detailed references and description of the outcomes. I've spent a lot of time with this review, even though it just came out recently and is a absolute goldmine resource. It is also the major resource for everything I'm about to tell you if you would like to delve deeper into the material. So let's deal with this first question of when is the ideal feeding window, and here again, we're thinking about a schedule of eating that involves eating at least once every 24 hours, not two day or three day or every other day fast. So it turns out that the answer to the question, when is it best to eat is actually best answered by thinking about the other side of the coin, which is when is it best to fast? So, because we are fasting during sleep, it's very clear that it's best to extend the sleep-related fast either into the morning or to start it in the evening. Now this might seem kind of obvious, but it's actually not so obvious. You could place that feeding window early in the day, middle of the day or late in the day. Let's think about what happens when we sleep, when we sleep, our body undergoes a number of different processes in the brain and body in order to recover the cells and tissues. Many of you have probably heard of autophagic, which is essentially a cleaning up a gobbling up of dead cells and cells that are injured or sick. And this is a natural process that occurs, and it occurs mainly during sleep. Although not only during sleep, fasting of any kind does tend to enhance autophagy. It is not the only way to create autophagic conditions. Autophagic conditions can be created simply by following a sub caloric diet. And there are other things that one can do in order to trigger autophagy, but fasting does trigger autophagy. So when we're asleep, the bad cells are getting gobbled up and eaten. And the good cells also are undergoing certain repair mechanisms mainly related to, or at least governed by those circadian genes that we talked about earlier, those clock genes. So you're already fasting when you're asleep and how deep you are into that fast depends on how long it was since your last meal. So if you fast early in the day, and you've been asleep for 5, 6, 7, 8 hours, I would hope somewhere between six and eight hours for most people is going to be beneficial. When you wake up, I mentioned earlier that you don't want to eat for at least the first 60 minutes after waking, but were you to extend that fasting to say, 9:00 AM 10:00 AM, 11:00 AM or even 12 noon or later you are taking advantage of the deep, fast that you were in during sleep. And certainly toward the end of sleep, now, why do I say deep, fast? Well, because when we eat the clearance of that food from our gut"}
{"question": "What is the specific technique of using deep breathing, specifically physiological sighs, to calm the nervous system and conserve energy between sets of resistance training, and how does it differ from other methods of recovery and focus during workouts?", "doc_id": "q1Ss8sTbFBY_14", "video_id": "q1Ss8sTbFBY", "video_title": "Fitness Toolkit: Protocol & Tools to Optimize Physical Health | Huberman Lab Podcast #94", "video_header": "Tool: Mind-Muscle Contraction, Physiological Sighs", "segment_idx": "14", "time_start": "1:31:51", "time_end": "1:35:56", "context": "be hyper focused on things like strength and hypertrophy and the aesthetics that come with it. A key point about strength hypertrophy and weight training, and this is something that has been covered on multiple podcasts, certainly the one with Jeff Cavaliere and with Dr. Andy Galpin and the one that I did on building muscle strength and hypertrophy, the solo episode. And that is the following, it is the rare individual who has perfectly balanced musculature, right? Most people can be a bit quad dominant or hamstring dominant, or they have trouble activating their glutes or somebody has a terrible time trying to activate their chest muscles, but they're very strong in the back, et cetera. It's very clear that we can know that not just based on aesthetics, right, but based on deliberate contractibility of those muscles. So I don't want to get into this in too much detail for sake of time, but this is something that has peer reviewed research to support it and was also discussed extensively with Jeff Cavaliere when he was a guest. And that actually he's really popularized this notion and it's absolutely true, which is that if you can contract a muscle very hard to the point where it almost feels like it's cramping, if you can do that even when there's no weight in your hand or there's no resistance against it, so you're just using your mind muscle connection to contract that muscle hard and isolate it, chances are you'll be able to generate hypertrophy and strength gains pretty easily in that muscle compared to muscles that you have a harder time activating. So during all resistance training, that mind muscle link is really important, so much so that some people will even try and emphasize contraction of the muscles in between sets, et cetera. I personally, because I'm not somebody who likes a mirror when I work out, and I'm not somebody who wants to spend time in between sets flexing muscles and et cetera for whatever reason, I want to actually rest between sets, and I'm more concerned with performance during those sets and really putting my mind into the muscle during the set, I really try and emphasize deep relaxation between sets. And so here's a tool that again is built out of science and I should say peer reviewed studies, some of which are being done in my lab, but other labs as well, which is that in between sets what I really strive to do is to bring my heart rate down as much as possible, calm myself down as much as possible, and I'll do the so-called physiological sigh in order to do that. That's two inhales through the nose, back to back, and then long full exhale through the mouth. I just did it partially there for the sake of time, again. So a big deep inhale through the nose and then sneak in a little bit more on a second inhale to maximally inflate the lungs and the alveoli in the lungs, and then a full exhale of all your air via the mouth to empty your lungs. That's the fastest way that we are aware of to calm your nervous system down. And really, in between sets you can use that to calm yourself down and conserve energy. But then as you move into the weight training set, you really want to ratchet up your focus and attention to the muscles that you're going to be using. Now, I'd like to acknowledge that there's a huge range of parameters in terms of how to actually perform during the set. You can focus on a particular muscle and try and really isolate from the beginning of the movement. Some people will really try and isolate it only during the peak contraction. Some people accentuate the negative. There's speed and cadence. There are, again, remember, concepts are few, methods are many. And if you're interested in the various methods of eccentrics and concentrics and all the different ways of changing up cadence and so forth during sets, there's an enormous amount of quality information out there, far too much for us to get into detail now. But what I describe the general principles of how to set your mind, if you will, during the set, you should be focused on the muscles that you're using and or moving the weight. If movement of the weight is more important, you can either focus on moving the weight or challenging muscles, right? You can either try and isolate muscles and make specific muscles do the work or simply moving the weight. Moving the weight is going to be more geared towards strength improvements, but focusing on the muscle, so called mind muscle link is going to shift that very same set more toward hypertrophy. I realize I'm painting with a broad brush here, but nonetheless this is grounded in the way that the nervous system governs muscular contraction. And while I think most people are familiar with the number of different variables associated with the resistance training, sets, reps, rest intervals,"}

{"question": "What are the key ways that temperature, specifically cold, can be used to improve physical performance, recovery, and overall well-being?", "doc_id": "xaE9XyMMAHY_4", "video_id": "xaE9XyMMAHY", "video_title": "Supercharge Exercise Performance & Recovery with Cooling", "video_header": "Temperature Is the Dominant Variable", "segment_idx": "4", "time_start": "10:02", "time_end": "12:02", "context": "Now many of you might think, oh, well that's kind of boring, I want to know about the magic pill that I can take that's going to allow me to dunk a basketball if I currently can't or I want to know about the thing that's going to let me run further and faster is going to shed fat. Believe it or not, temperature is the most powerful variable for improving physical performance and for recovery. I would argue it's even more important than sleep because temperature itself is going to dictate how well and when you sleep and the depth of your total recovery. There are two aspects to temperature of course, there's heat and there's cold. We are mainly going to focus on cold as a way to buffer heat. In a previous podcast episode, I talked all about growth hormone. You can find that episode about fibroid and growth hormone and how heat can be a powerful stimulus for increasing growth hormone which is involved in tissue repair and et cetera and burn fat and improve metabolism in various ways. However, cold I would argue is even more powerful than heat as a tool and I'm not just talking about putting ice packs on sore muscles or slightly sprained limbs and ankles and things of that sort. We're going to talk about cold from the standpoint of thermal physiology. This is a literature that's rich in scientific information that goes back very deep into the last century where physiologists and neuroscientists figured out that there are different compartments in your body that heat and cool you differently and that you can leverage those in order to double and as I mentioned before even triple or quadruple your work output both strength, repetitions, and endurance. So this is not weak sauces that they say, this is the stuff that can really shift the needle quite a bit and it's not just about well once, it's about being able to perform well and recover from that performance so that you do even better when you're not incorporating these tools on days where for instance, you can't access cold or an ice pack or an ice bath or things of that sort, okay?"}
{"question": "Can pheromones play a role in regulating menstrual cycles and influencing human behavior, particularly in terms of mate recognition and attraction?", "doc_id": "qJXKhu5UZwk_13", "video_id": "qJXKhu5UZwk", "video_title": "The Science of How to Optimize Testosterone & Estrogen", "video_header": "Pheromones: Miscarriage, Menstrual Cycles, Puberty Onset, & Mate Recognition", "segment_idx": "13", "time_start": "34:24", "time_end": "43:32", "context": "but of the same species, or even of other species. Now, pheromone effects are absolutely well-established in lots of animal species, but they are very controversial in humans. Today, I'm going to talk about some of the well-established ones in animals, I've mentioned one or two of these before on previous podcasts, but I haven't mentioned several of them, and I'm going to talk about the evidence for pheromones in humans that are well-established. So the main ones in animals that are discussed are called the Lee-Boot effect, the Whitten effect, the Bruce effect, and the Vandenbergh effect, named after the people that discovered them. The Lee-Boot effect is when you house females of a given species together with no males, they start displaying longer, what are called estrus cycles, in many species, they don't have menstrual cycles, which are 28 days, they have estrus cycles which tend to be four days or some variant thereof. It's an interesting phenomenon because what it means is that the presence of the male itself is changing the ovulation cycle. Now, many people out there, I imagine mostly the people that are ovulating out there will say, \"Of course, I notice I ovulate differently, \"or my cycle changes when I'm in the presence of my partner \"or I'm not,\" but the pheromone effect that mirrors this Lee-Boot effect in humans has still not really been identified, nobody knows what the exact chemical is, but nonetheless, this is a strong effect in some animals. The other one is the Bruce effect, and this is a very dramatic effect whereby a pregnant animal will abort or reabsorb her fetus if the dad of those animals, the father that sired the litter, because these are animals, they're litters, is removed and a novel male is placed in her vicinity for about 48 hours, and what's interesting is the way that this happens is a pheromone that comes from male urine activates the gonadotropin-releasing hormone system and causes a reintroduction of the estrus cycle and a spontaneous abortion of the fetus. Now, a lot of people have taken the Bruce effect kind of to its extreme and asked whether or not in humans, miscarriages are caused by detecting the pheromones or odors of novel males, meaning the non-dad male, and that's still an open question, nobody knows if that's true or not, so I want to emphasize that. The other one is the Vandenbergh effect, and this is one I alluded to in a previous episode of the podcast, which is that puberty in females can be accelerated by placing a novel sexually competent male in with a young female who has not undergone puberty. There's also a version of this, which I haven't described, which is delay of puberty where you take juvenile female animals that have not undergone puberty and you put them with more mature females of the same species, and that introduction of more females will cause a delay, a significant delay in the onset of puberty. So these are all pheromone effects, and we know they're pheromone effects because they're not conscious, they also don't require actual contact with the other members of a given species, these are all effects that can be mediated by the urine from a given species or by the sweat of a given species, and speaking of sweat, the one pheromone effect that I'm very aware of from the published literature is a paper that was published in 1998 by Stern and McClintock which was getting at this question of synchronization of menstrual cycles. Now, the whole idea of synchronization of menstrual cycles is pretty controversial, for a long time, people said, \"Oh, this is absolutely a well-characterized phenomenon,\" people in dormitories, their menstrual cycles would synchronize, people living in environments together, their menstrual cycles would synchronize, and then some studies came out that kind of undercut those data and said no, this actually doesn't happen, and it was kind of controversial, but there is a very clear effect that was described by Stern and McClintock, what they did actually was they took females, they charted their cycles, and then they had other females wear pads in their armpits and they collected sweat from those females, and then they took the sweat from those pads in those female's armpits, and they introduced them to women who had never had contact with the people who had sweated, they only had contact with their sweat, in fact, they swabbed it underneath their nose, and if that sounds gross, they dilute it in alcohol, so much so that they can't actually detect the odor of the sweat, that's actually very important because it's not the smell, it's the pheromone chemical itself, and it turns out the pheromone chemical itself can modulate the menstrual cycle, although it doesn't necessarily synchronize it with the sweater, what it does is it changes the duration and the pattern of ovulation relative to the so-called follicular phase, long and short of this is that the sweat and pheromones of females can modulate the menstrual cycle patterns of other adult females, it's just a question of whether or not they synchronize, and if you're kind of rolling your eyes now and saying, \"Well, of course they do, \"and this is really detailed,\" this is how the science is done, and the reason why people are so skeptical about the presence of pheromone effects in humans is that there's no well-identified pheromone organ, you know, we have an area of our nose that's responsible for smelling, that's well-established, it's been observed in MRIs many, many times, in cadavers many, many times, in pretty much all individuals, but the vomeronasal organ, which is the pheromone-detecting organ, hasn't really been found in humans, there's something called Jacobson's organ, which is thought to be the organ in the nose, it's actually on the top of the roof of the mouth and in the kind of back of the nose, this is for you wine tasters, I never can pronounce this, what are they called, sommelier, whatevers, the people that are excellent at drinking and detecting the essences of wine that you have to go through all these tests in order to get certified as one of them, somebody tell me, they are using probably a similar mechanism of mixing taste and smell, and Jacobson's organ, if it exists, the vomeronasal equivalent in humans, is thought to be a combination of smell and taste. Now, it gets even weirder and cooler when you think about a given study that was done in humans where if you take hundreds of t-shirts from boyfriends, keep them separate, you take those t-shirts, you wash them many times separately, and then you offer them to the girlfriends, the long-time partners of those guys, and what you'll find is that the girlfriend can pick out her boyfriend's t-shirt among hundreds of other t-shirts, not because it smells different, but because something about it seems different, it might smell different to her in some way that's kind of imperceptible even to her, and the level of accuracy in detecting that t-shirt, her partner's t-shirt, is way above statistical significant thresholds, so much so that you almost have to say there's something about these effects that are real pheromone effects, although people still argue that there are no pheromone effects in humans, that it's all through olfaction, I think these are interesting and important to understand because it means that a lot of things coming through our nose, whether or not it's pheromones or smells, are impacting hormones and our ability to attach memories and kind of recognition of mates and other people, including our children, not just our mates, and of course, perfume manufacturers have really picked up on the idea of pheromones and have entire laboratories set up to build chemical compounds into perfumes that are designed to attract other mates, this is a well-established and well-documented phenomenon. And the last point I'll make about pheromones is that this combination of taste and smell is such a real thing in the animal world that there's something called the flehmen response, during the mating seasons for different animals, you can actually even see this in horses, but for animals that are seasonal maters, they'll do something called the flehmen response where they actually open their lips and their mouth and they expose their gums so that they can capture pheromones that are floating in the wind in the environment, they actually are looking for mates using their mouth and kind of sniffing around. If you own a dog and you watch the way that the dog will sniff around selecting where they want to urinate, males and females, they're bringing molecules into their nose, I know it sounds kind of gross, sniffing urine, but there are a lot of pheromones in urine of animals, a lot of pheromones that are traveling in the wind, again, whether or not this is happening in humans, I don't know, but then you think about the perfume thing, and here people are putting these scents on themselves that contain putative pheromones, human pheromones, and walking around hoping that their scents are going to evoke mate-seeking behavior from other individuals of the same human species, so we are among the animals in this behavior, independent of whether or not you believe pheromone effects exist. So let's get back to behaviors that can help optimize hormone levels. One of the main behaviors that's been shown"}
{"question": "Is it normal for people to experience a strong emotional attachment to someone who has passed away, and how can one effectively remap their emotional closeness to the person without undermining the attachment?", "doc_id": "dzOvi0Aa2EA_8", "video_id": "dzOvi0Aa2EA", "video_title": "The Science & Process of Healing from Grief | Huberman Lab Podcast #74", "video_header": "Memories of Loved Ones & Remapping Attachments", "segment_idx": "8", "time_start": "44:44", "time_end": "48:00", "context": "and entirely normal to us, in the best and most healthy sense of the word normal. For instance, if you've lost somebody, or an animal, or even a thing that was vitally important to you, it should make perfect sense to you as to why you keep looking for that person. I recall this in my own life. I had the unfortunate circumstance of my graduate advisor, who I was very close with, died quite young of breast cancer. And her daughter, she actually has two daughters, kept her cellphone and would occasionally call me. I had a quite close relationship to their family. And when it would come in, the number would pop up on my phone of not the daughter, but the name that showed up was of my graduate advisor. So for years after she died, my initial impulse, when the phone would ring was, \"Oh my goodness, she's calling.\" It was a reflexive excitement because I truly always enjoyed hearing from her. She was a wonderful, incredibly wonderful person, I should say. Similarly, when somebody passes away, we will find ourselves looking into a room expecting to see them there, or expecting them to knock on the door any moment, or to call on Sunday morning, as it were. Those expectations, those predictions that the brain is making, are entirely normal, because they are based on that deep catalog of episodic memory that you maintain about that person. Again, the depth and richness of that catalog scaling, of course, in direct relation to how close you were with that person, right? Closer to somebody means more information about them. More information about them means your brain has a lot of implicit, unconscious notions of when and where and how they show up. So the fact that your brain, and indeed, sometimes your body reacts to the expectation that they'll be there is entirely normal. It's simply an activation of this map that involves closeness, space, and time. Not surprisingly, then, the reordering of that map that's required in order to move through the grieving process, is going to involve some remapping. And you, as the person grieving, have the opportunity to ask which node as it's called, which element or dimension within that map, are you going to focus on? Some people really try hard to disengage with and remap their sense of emotional closeness to the person. That is, it's so unbelievably overwhelming to them, that the person is no longer accessible, that they try and change their ideas about how close they really were. They try and change their emotional attachment to the person after they've died. Clearly in the example that I gave in the Feynman letter, that's not the case. The attachment seems indeed quite fixed and not going anywhere. Psychologists and neuroscientists generally agree that the best way to approach moving through grief is actually to remap these dimensions while maintaining the close sense of attachment to the person, by not in any way trying to undermine the intensity of the attachment or how important it was to you. So we'll now talk about how that process works,"}

{"question": "Are there distinct forms of microbiota along the entire length of the digestive tract, and how do these microbiota communities differ from one another in terms of their structure and function?", "doc_id": "ouCWNRvPk20_4", "video_id": "ouCWNRvPk20", "video_title": "Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: How to Build, Maintain & Repair Gut Health | Huberman Lab Podcast #62", "video_header": "Gastrointestinal (GI) Tract & Microbiota Variability", "segment_idx": "4", "time_start": "12:53", "time_end": "15:55", "context": "varies as you descend, as you go from mouth to throat and stomach. And you said that most of the microbiota are in the distal colon. Are there distinct forms of microbiota all along the length of the digestive tract, and within these other interfaces with the outside world? - Totally. Yeah. So it starts with our teeth and in our mouth, and saliva, there's a oral microbiota. These microbial species are very different than the ones that you find in the digestive tract. They're usually built to deal with oxygen very well. They're in an area that is exposed to a lot of oxygen, they of course see different nutrients than, for instance, the colonic bacteria would see. And they grow quite often in mats that live on teeth. So they're very structured in terms of... And not moving around a lot. So they're very, fairly stationary. As you move down the digestive tract, there are microbes in esophagus in our stomach, but those communities are not very dense, and actually not very well studied. We know of a very... There's a very famous stomach bacteria known as Helicobacter pylori, which can cause stomach ulcers and cause gastric cancer in some less frequent situations. But this is a very different set of microbes, they have to be adapted to a different environment, in the stomach especially, incredibly acidic environment. But also very different in terms of their ability to interact with other microbes, just because the communities are less dense, they're less dynamic, there's less nutrients that stay there and passage through the community. So a lot of times those communities are reliant upon nutrients derived from the host, as opposed to nutrients derived from our diet. As you move down out of the stomach, into the small intestine, you start to see these communities, which are the ones that are becoming more well-studied. Small intestine is still a bit of a black box, just because it's hard to access. And so there's some really cool technologies out there for using, for instance, capsules to do sampling as the capsule passes through the digestive tract, so that we have a better idea of what's going on in the small intestine. And then you get to the colon, and this is the community that's just so incredibly densely packed, doing a ton of... There's a ton of metabolic activity happening there, and a bunch of interaction with the host. And that's the community that's really the best studied. Part of the reason for that is because stool is so easy to obtain compared to, for instance, something in the stomach or small intestine. And that stool is fairly representative, we know, from studies that have been done using colonoscopies and so forth. Stool is fairly representative of what's happening in the colon. So dense, super exciting community, but also the best studied, just because it's the easiest to access in the lower digestive tract. - Very interesting. I imagine these microbiota have to get in there"}
{"question": "What is ibogaine, a substance extracted from the iboga tree root bark, and how does it work to facilitate life reviews and potentially treat PTSD, depression, and other mental health conditions?", "doc_id": "X4QE6t-MkYE_21", "video_id": "X4QE6t-MkYE", "video_title": "Dr. Nolan Williams: Psychedelics & Neurostimulation for Brain Rewiring | Huberman Lab Podcast #93", "video_header": "Ibogaine & “Life Review”; PTSD, Depression & Clinical Trials", "segment_idx": "21", "time_start": "1:45:36", "time_end": "1:57:11", "context": "I actually feel some relief just hearing this, because I am slightly... I wouldn't say ashamed as sort of embarrassed by it, but I offer it as a, you know, it is what it is, as they say. And it certainly doesn't seem to hinder my life much, knock on wood. - Nice. - So if we could talk a bit about ibogaine. I don't know much about ibogaine, although anytime I hear the, you know, A-I-N-E, you know, lidocaine, ibogaine, I think of an anesthetic. And going to the dentist, which is an unpleasant experience for me, generally. What is ibogaine? Does this have anything to do with the so-called toad? You know, people talk about smoking frog skin, toad skin. What is it used for clinically? Is it legal in the US as a clinical tool? Who's using it and for what purposes? If you could educate me on ibogaine, I truly know nothing about it, except I think I know how to spell it correctly. - Yeah, that's fair, yeah. So ibogaine is one of the alkaloids that you can extract from a iboga tree root bark that's typically growing in the country of Gabon, Africa. So Gabon is one of the West African countries, kind of middle of Africa and on the west coast. And Gabon has a group of folks, you know, called the Bwiti. It's a religious kind of sacramental group that sacramentally uses iboga root bark as part of the sacrament. And they've been using iboga root bark for a very long time. And it's, you know, part of the tradition. There's a whole set of kind of ceremony around it. If you're interested in this, there's a book called \"Breaking Open the Head\" by Daniel Pinchbeck that goes through and talks about this whole process. But essentially the Gabonese have been using this for a long time and it's a kind of an atypical psychedelic. It's not a psychedelic that we normally think about with psilocybin and LSD where there are visual perceptual changes, right? So if you take psilocybin or LSD, what you experience is you experience these kind of visual perceptual differences in the external world, right? And on enough LSD or psilocybin, an individual can actually perceive something visually in the external world that isn't there, as we talked about earlier. Ibogaine doesn't do that. Ibogaine does something different. It's kind of like, have you ever seen \"Minority Report,\" you know, the movie with Tom Cruise, I think 15 or 20 years ago or something? So it dates us a little bit, but it was this movie where he would be able to go and see these kind of pre crimes. And he had this big screen where he could look at scenes from time and like kind of go through that scene and see it. And so what individuals taking ibogaine will say is that open eyes, they don't see anything, but closed eyes, they'll go back through and re-experience earlier life memories and they will be able to experience it from a place of empathy, not only for themselves, but from others, and kind of detached empathy and being able to see this as almost a third party, even though they were there. But they're able to see it, you know, as a third party. So Claudia Naranjo, a psychiatrist from Argentina, described this for a lot of books that he wrote, in I think the '80s and '90s around this. And so, you know, ibogaine's been around for a long time. Howard Lotsof, American guy that brought it over from Africa. He was a polysubstance user, used every drug that he could get his hands on, took ibogaine, and including a lot of other psychedelics, by the way, took ibogaine and then never did another drug again, supposedly because he had such a profound ibogaine experience. Ibogaine is in no way a recreational substance. It's not a recreational substance if you want it to be a recreational substance, because you're essentially having this, what they call life review. They also call it 10 years of psychotherapy in a night. So these are the terminology that people talk about the issue. - How long does it last? Is it truly one night? - It's usually, you know, it can go, depending upon if you get re-dosed or anything, go sometimes, depending upon how fast you metabolize it, sometimes 24, sometimes 36 hours. Sometimes it can be shorter, but it is a long time. It's a very long time. So it's definitely the longest acting psychedelic substance I know of. And so people, you will take this, and they'll have this reevaluation of a given memory. And then as we were talking about earlier, reconsolidate that memory again, and then it seems to have, you know, an effect of that reconsolidation process. And so, you know, about five, four, five years ago, I was tapped by Robert Malenka, one of the senior neuroscientists we both know in the university. And he says, \"Well, there's an unnamed donor that's very interested in funding a scientific, kind of open label study of these Navy SEALs that have been going down to Mexico and taking ibogaine and also 5-MeO-DMT,\" which I'll talk about in a second, to treat PTSD. You know, they claim to have traumatic brain injury, depression, you know, that whole constellation of symptoms. You know, and as it was described to me by various people that had done this, by their spouses and and whatnot, you know, John, we'll just say John, John couldn't screw a light bulb into a light fixture, right? They were just so debilitated they couldn't do simple tasks, what we call activities of daily living. And they were coming back and having these really dramatic improvements in all aspects of life. And so, you know, we have over the last couple of years been able to do this first in human, kind of full neurobiological clinical neurocognitive evaluation of what ibogaine is doing. In this case, in special operations, special forces individuals, former Navy SEALs, former Army Rangers, that kind of crew of folks, and look at the pre-post changes that their experience to be able to totally quantitate all of that. And so we've been able to capture all the clinical scales, you know, depression scales, PTSD scales, all that standard stuff, neurocognitive batteries. So how does your executive function work specifically? How does your verbal memory, all of that? And then neuroimaging and EEG. So this will be the first human study of ibogaine for those. And the reason why is because ibogaine is kind of the... Both seemingly the most potent and most seemingly, to me at least, most powerful psychedelic, but the one that has the most risk too, because it has a cardiac effect. It seems to be that you can screen people out that have risk off of their electrocardiogram and reduce the risk quite a bit. And that's what we all did. But that's why people haven't really studied it as much. And it isn't as, in addition, nobody goes to a rave on ibogaine. There's no recreation at all with this. - It's not fun. - It's, people say that it's relieving, but it's hard work, right? Because yeah, you're reexamining things. And you know, and so then we see these folks after, and I'll tell you, you know, we haven't fully analyzed the data yet, but I'll tell you that, you know, from what my folks are telling me, it's pretty dramatic. You know, people come back and they're doing a lot better. They're doing a lot better. And nobody, I'll knock on wood, nobody's had any sort of cardiac issue at all in the cohort that we've studied and they look a lot better and they feel a lot better too. And they describe these experiences of being able to go back through and, you know, soldiers experienced something called moral injury, right? Where maybe they accidentally blew something up and had a kid in it or something like that. You know, if they're in Afghanistan, Iraq, maybe, you know, a child died on accident or maybe a civilian died or whatever it was, right? And they suffer these moral injuries as part of the job. And it's almost one of the kind of vocational risks. They come back and say that they've forgiven themselves, you know, which is huge, right? And part of that is being able to see themselves in a different light and having empathy finally for themselves and being able to kind of have that experience of forgiving. And so, very cool. The study, you know, what was happening was they were taking ibogaine and then taking something called 5-MeO-DMT. People call it the Toad, it's the Sonoran River Toad. I think it's like you can find these in Mexico, find 'em in Arizona. In the back of the toad produces something called 5-MeO-DMT, which is a flavor of DMT that produces a particular psychedelic effect also used as a sacrament. - Is it dimethyltryptamine? - It is a 5-MeO dimethyltryptamine. So it's a kind of a dimethyltryptamine with a kind of addition to it. The deal there is that it lasts longer than traditional DMT. You know, it's like 20 minutes to five, three, or whatever kind of thing. And so these guys were taking ibogaine and then they would take the 5-MeO-DMT after. We had to kind of divorce those two things to be able to do the study and just understand what the ibogaine was doing. And they'd go back down a month later and they'll do the 5-MeO-DMT. - So two completely separate sessions. - Two completely separate sessions. - And then one quick question about ibogaine before a bit more on 5-MeO-DMT. Is the ibogaine journey guided, or the person just closes their eyes and they just start falling into the back catalog of memories? - They have a bunch of preparatory sessions, and then they have a bunch of sessions after that they're able to kind of rehash things. During, there's a sitter that sits there and kind of sits with them and helps them out, but it's not, it's pretty, the phenomenon of the drug seems to drive a lot of this, right? And so a lot of it ends up being what we call supportive psychotherapy. You're just kind of being there and, you know, maybe you're holding the person's hand, maybe you're just saying \"I'm here,\" or maybe whatever it is, but you're making sure they know you're around. But there's not really an interaction per se. And then the whole kind of goal there is just to get folks to kind go back through and reexamine these memories and ultimately look like they reconsolidate them. And you know, it's very interesting."}

It numbs the environment of the injury, which is not surprising, and will eliminate the pain for a short while, but it has some negative effects that perhaps offset its use. One, it sludges, it creates sludging within the blood and other lymphatic tissue, so it actually can create some clotting and sludging of the tissue and fluids, the fascial interface with muscle, and a number of the stuff that's supposed to be flowing through there can slow up and increase inflammation in the wrong way, can actually restrict movement out of the injury site, which is bad because you want the macrophages and the other cell types phagocytosing, eating up, the debris in an injury and moving it out of there so that it can repair. That was surprising to me which made me ask, \"Well, then what about heat?\" Well, it turns out heat is actually quite beneficial. A lot of people talk about heat shock proteins and all these genetic pathways and protein pathways that can be activated by heat. Very little data to support the idea that heat shock proteins are part of the wound healing process, at least in terms of the sorts of conventional heat that one could use like a hot water bottle or a hot bath or a hot compress. The major effects seem to be explained by heat improving the viscosity of the tissues and the clearance and the perfusion of fluid, blood, lymph and other fluids, out of the injury area. That's really interesting. I didn't know this. I thought, well, you're supposed to ice something. I said, well, whenever I would see a kid get injured in soccer, never me, of course, no, of course I got injured in soccer from time to time, they give you an ice pack and the ice pack removes some of the pain. I think the consensus now, which was surprising to me, is that the ice pack is actually more of the top-down modulation. You think you're doing something for the pain and there's some interesting studies that actually showed the placebo effect of the ice pack, so ice packs are placebo, perhaps. That's interesting. I'll underline perhaps because who knows? Maybe there's some people out there that are going to say this is totally crazy and the ice is actually very beneficial, but it seems like heat, mobility, sleep, keeping movement, and it turns out that the movement itself can act as a bit of an analgesic, it can actually reduce the pain, whereas the ice reduces the pain but sludges the tissue and keeps the cells that need to be removed from leaving the area. What's also interesting is in neuroscience we know that if we want to kill neurons or silence neurons, we cool them. This is a well-known tool in the laboratory. Some of the early and most important studies in neuroscience that formed the basis for the textbooks were lowering a cooling probe into a particular area of the brain or a peripheral nerve in order to shut down that nerve, so the cooling will shut down the nerve, but another very well-known fact in neuroscience text books is that when the activity of the nerve pathway or neurons comes back, there's what's called homeostatic plasticity, that it rebounds with greater pain, with a higher level of intensity, which in the pain system would equate to greater pain. Regardless of where these neurons are in the body, if you stimulate a neuron, it's active. If you cool it, it becomes inactive and when the neuron heats back up after being cooled, it becomes hyperactive, and so this makes really good sense as to why heat, provided it's not damaging levels of heat, would be more beneficial for wound healing and for reducing pain in the short and long run than would be cold or ice, which I find very interesting. In terms of chronic pain, the manuscripts on this, my discussion with Kelly and with others, point to the fact that chronic pain is basically plasticity gone wrong. It's sort of like PTSD for the emotional system and the stress system, and chronic pain is going to involve a number of different protocols to rewire both the brain centers"}

that I as a non-clinician view the the landscape of a lot of social media as as borderline and I have no credential to be able to diagnose an individual let alone the internet but so I'll be clear about my limitations um whenever possible but there are real pathologies of the of the psyche of the mind yes um I'd be curious about your view of the ones that tend to capture people's um attention the most you know I mean uh I think we Now understand some of the neurochemical basis of certain CH psychiatric challenges schizophrenia bipolar in particular OCD particular sometimes by way of which medications they respond to or don't um but that alone doesn't allow us to understand their underlying mechanisms I think a lot of that is still mysterious but I'd love um to get a different perspective on these things which is the psychological perspective which um of course Embraces biology but um looks at it a little bit differently so um yeah what what are your thoughts about the way that these days um these words are slung and um and what's your view about our actual treatment for these uh for these conditions both for the people suffering from them and the people that suffer because others suffer from them yeah well you're asking me to speak both as a therapist and as a citizen I think and I'll address the first one first um part of the therapist's role is to differential diagnosis in other words if a person comes in with a depression we have to try to Define what kind of depression are we talking about there different kinds of depression is this a reactive depression it's only pathological if it lasts too long or lasts interferes with their normal functioning too much and that's a judgment call if a person's grieving the loss of something important in their life the loss of a marriage would say it's appropriate to feel uh depressed for a certain length of time until life's ches move one forward and so forth there is um um biologically driven depression which can be approached with medication although many of the anti-depressants are very limited in their success long-term therapy tends to be more effective as various Studies have recognized albeit there's a you know an economic cause to that and then thirdly there's what you can call an intas psychic depression which is what I experienced was that you know there were certain parts of my life that had been walled off and and you know that was crying out pathology comes from the Greek word pathos which means suffering and logos which means expression of so pathology means the expression of the suffering Psychopathology is expression of the suffering of the Soul so what is it in terms of this person's natural desire to live in a meaningful way that's interfering with her life is it biologically driven is it as function of the social context in which they live or is it some personal task that they have to address and that kind of differential diagnosis is is essential and as you said there are certain conditions that are predominantly biologically driven such as schizophrenia bipolar Etc so secondly then speaking as as a citizen you know the internet and I don't want to get lost in the internet again but it's like it's a vast Open Stage in which whatever is unaddressed in people can can be put out there without censorship without reflection without the other being represented and you know it it allows people to to reveal whatever is going on within them uh with without genuine dialogue and of course you can have opposition but what has to happen typically is again associating with like-minded people I must be right because these other people agree with me you see so you know any of these terms can be misappropriated and and will be sooner or later so what one has to say is we can only make diagnosis with you know observation over time it's very hard initially to to know what's really going on as I mentioned what we do or what someone does is logical what we don't know is what it's in service to inside of them and you will not get much sense of that by the internet because it's too superficial that's why it takes repeated observation and conversation for that to emerge the reason I keep coming back to"}
{"question": "Do you think that people can embody different animal archetypes, similar to how dogs or owners can resemble each other in certain ways, and if so, do you have any personal experiences with this phenomenon?", "doc_id": "__RAXBLt1iM_28", "video_id": "__RAXBLt1iM", "video_title": "Jocko Willink: How to Become Resilient, Forge Your Identity & Lead Others | Huberman Lab Podcast 104", "video_header": "People & Animals, Personalities", "segment_idx": "28", "time_start": "3:42:21", "time_end": "3:51:22", "context": "I have to ask about something. This is going to seem like a total divergence but it's not, which is animals. Because first of all, they're a love of mine in terms of understanding the animal kingdom and placing humans into the animal kingdom. Second of all, I know you're a hunter. And also I know you own dogs. And the question I have is, do you ever look at people, or did you ever work in Teams of guys when you were on active duty-- see that the difference is you mentioned before, this person is really good at problem solving, this person's a little bit more creative. Do you ever wonder whether or not people embody different animal archetypes? Because I do. JOCKO WILLINK: Well, that thing where people say that dogs or owners look like their dogs, dogs look like their owners, I think that's-- I've seen all kinds of examples. You can go on the internet and find a bunch of examples of dogs that look like their owners and owners that look like their dogs. So I think that's true. And I think my dog is awesome. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Tell me about your dog. What kind of dog is it? JOCKO WILLINK: My dog is a German Shepherd. His name is Odin, and he's an awesome dog. And he's got a personality. He's got an interesting personality. So like he doesn't like to cuddle. My kids will be like oh, he doesn't like to cuddle. No. Even when we go to bed at night, he goes to 4 feet away from the foot of my bed. Even if I was like, hey, jump up. I've told him, jump up in here. We want to pet you. He'll jump up in there, and he just like goes in that low crouch position. And then waits until I say, free dog, and then he goes back down, and he goes 4 feet away from the foot of the bed and sits there. Because that's his personality is to protect, and set security, and do his job. And that's what he's like. And so you've got other dogs that are-- they're in a totally different mindset. So yeah, dogs have definite personalities. And look, I also have-- it's not all genetic. So two of my friends got dogs that were brothers. What are they called? Dogo Argentinos. You know those? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, the Dogoes? Yeah, those are hard to get in the US. They're not-- They might not even be legal in the United States, so don't tell me who these people are. Not that I care, but I'm not going to report them. JOCKO WILLINK: I won't tell you who they are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. JOCKO WILLINK: But these two guys-- and those two guys had different personalities. One guy is a very happy-go-lucky, likes to smoke pot, likes to hang out, very just a chill, playful guy. The other guy is not. He's the opposite in every category. And they both got these dogs. And you fast forward like a year, the dog that was owned by the playful guy, his dog was just a big puppy licking at-- just wagging the tail. The other dog, you had to keep it in a cage or it would murder everything in sight. And these dogs were brothers from the same litter, and they were completely opposite. And so I think it has a lot more to do with nurture than it does to do with nature. But that being said, when you look at Malinois I mean, Malinois have a personality that is very distinct compared to a German Shepherd. Now, look there's outlying Malinois, there's outlying German Shepherds, there's outlying you name whatever kind of Golden Retriever or whatever dog is known for being more playful. You get around the Malinois, Malinois are Malinois. And they're that way. Have you been around Malinois before? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mm-hmm. Oh, uh-- JOCKO WILLINK: The Belgian Malinois? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, a few of them. My neighbor has one, and that thing is not terribly friendly. But it's a security dog, so I don't expect it to be. JOCKO WILLINK: Exactly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's yeah, I know they use them for work in the Teams. And I've heard that you have to keep a close eye on your relationship with them because if you get lax about it, they'll bite you. JOCKO WILLINK: That's for true. The first time I saw one we were doing a drill using dogs for the first time. And then one of the Team guide dog handlers came out. And so we hit this target building, and they prebriefed us like, hey, you hit this target building, and this guy is going to be a runner, a squirter. And so we pull up in the Humvees, assault team jumps out, I'm staying external, I want to see what's going to happen. So the squirter goes running off. And the dog handler-- whatever-- tracks his dog on this guy, and then releases it, gives him whatever commands-- --or whatever the commands are. That thing is totally primed. Unlike anything you've ever seen in your life. It is just primed. It's tracking that guy. He hits that release on that leash, and that thing takes off at 1,000 miles an hour. It jumps like, I'm not kidding, 15 feet, maybe 10 feet in the air away and just chomps onto this dude. The dude goes down. It was freaking awesome. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I've seen some videos of those Malinois. I guess, I didn't-- forgive me because before I didn't know what you were referring to Belgian Malinois. Those dogs like running up trees, jumping over little rivers. Yeah, it's crazy. Incredibly powerful animals. Yeah. Well, the idea that they mimic their owners has me a little concerned because my last dog, I had to put him down. It was my bulldog Costello. He's a Bulldog Mastiff. I got him because I went to pick out a puppy, basically. And there were eight of these bulldogs. And all of them were running around, and then there's one in the background just eating out of all of their bowls. And I was like, I want that one. Big bulldog, biggest one in the litter. Laziest creature. Not just dog but laziest creature that ever existed. But if you need to activate, he would. He was just very efficient with his energy. And I don't think I have a bulldog personality, and that's why I got him to balance me out. Never retrieved, never did anything. Stole and destroyed every toy, every dog park in San Diego. He was famous there. I had to bring $5 bills to pay people for all the balls and things he would destroy. So anyway, my apologies to all the dog owners. Not really. I miss him. Did you train your dog, or did someone else in the house? JOCKO WILLINK: I did. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And was he trained to be a security dog, or family dog, or a mixture? JOCKO WILLINK: Yeah, I mean, they're true working dogs. Unless you have the time and effort to put into him, or you buy them that way, you don't want one of those dogs that I was just describing in your house. They're not for a house unless there's that level. My dog is not that level. He's awesome. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Did you apply some of the same principles that you use in leadership of humans with your dog? JOCKO WILLINK: Yeah, there are a lot of similar principles, but there's some differences. They're pack animals, and they respond to the pack leader. it's funny. My dog obeys me as if it's the command of God. And my wife, he's like maybe I'll do what you say. So they pick up on that stuff. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Dogs are very intuitive. I love this idea that I was told early on that they can feel your emotions. I think they actually can sense how we feel not just by the intonation of our voice. But I hope someday someone will figure out in a noninvasive way because I don't like the idea of people doing experiments on dogs in an invasive way. Like what they're picking up on? Like for instance, we know that sharks are paying attention to the amount of activity in the lateral line of fish. Fish have these stretches of neurons that they call the lateral line that allows them to school, and know the distance to different things, and be able to steer around coral. They feel proximity. It would be like if you're turning a corner, you go-- vrrt. --and they can even recognize specific lateral line signatures. So it'd be like you and Marc Lee walking together through the dark. But maybe people sift around. But you're like, you don't have to look at them, that's Marc. You learn him intuitively. A fish can do that. Sharks can sense whether or not the lateral line is-- let's say vibrating but firing at a particular frequency to know oh, that fish is a little bit slower than the rest. I mean, hunting animals just they develop these incredible senses. And I think humans have some of these senses in more rudimentary way. We're just not forced to use them unless, of course, you become a hunter of animals, or a hunter of humans, and you tap into these neural circuits that are very primitive and hardwired in everybody. But of course, they're honed in warriors. Well, I could spiral off into animal biology in ways that truly would take us 26 hours. I don't want to do that. I'm almost hesitant to ask this question, but I'm going to do it anyway."}
{"question": "Does Cannabis Really Increase Creativity?", "doc_id": "gXvuJu1kt48_17", "video_id": "gXvuJu1kt48", "video_title": "The Effects of Cannabis (Marijuana) on the Brain & Body | Huberman Lab Podcast #92", "video_header": "Does Cannabis Increase Creativity?", "segment_idx": "17", "time_start": "1:26:43", "time_end": "1:35:05", "context": "and its different components increase creativity. And when you look at the literature on this, you find studies that very clearly point to a yes, it increases creativity, and it's not surprising, therefore, that cannabis can increase dopamine transmission, that is dopamine levels, in certain brain areas, in particular brain areas involved in thinking and planning. So cannabis increases dopamine in these areas. Elevated dopamine increases divergent thinking, and divergent thinking is associated with creativity, and there are studies that support the idea that cannabis can increase creativity. However, there are at least as many studies that say that cannabis does not increase creativity, that cannabis increases consideration of multiple ideas, perhaps through elevation of dopamine and related systems, but that ultimately the ideas that converge from that are not truly creative ideas, at least they don't meet the criteria for creative brainstorming and extraction of ideas that are truly novel, so it doesn't increase creativity, so which one is it? Well, fortunately, there's an entirely distinct set of literature that has taken all the other literature into consideration, and here's where we arrive. So there's a really nice study that explored creativity in cannabis users, and we will provide a link to this study. First author is Emily LaFrance, and the title of the paper, somewhat amusing in its own right, which is, it starts with a question, inspired by Mary Jane, of course, Mary Jane being one of the old school versions or ways of talking about cannabis or marijuana. Nowadays, people refer to it mainly as pot, as other names too, of course, and the title of the paper is, \"Inspired by Mary Jane Mechanisms Underlying \"Enhanced Creativity in Cannabis Users.\" And I really like this study for a couple of reasons. First of all, they looked at people who did not use cannabis as well as people who used cannabis, so they had two different groups, but they did not evaluate creativity of the cannabis users while they were under the influence of cannabis. They looked at the level of creativity in these cannabis users when they were not under the influence of cannabis and asked whether or not their ability to be creative was enhanced by cannabis. Now we're going to compare this to studies in which people come into the laboratory and actually use cannabis, and then they evaluate creativity under that context. But this study has some unique takeaways that I think are really interesting. First of all, they did, yes, see evidence for enhanced creativity, and when I say enhanced creativity, I mean within the context of this divergent thinking thing that I talked about a moment ago. And when I say enhanced, I mean significantly greater than in non-users, so people that don't use cannabis. So right now I can imagine that all the cannabis users are cheering, \"Yes, cannabis increases creativity, \"makes people more creative than they would be otherwise.\" Well, this is interesting. We have to ask ourselves how that was accomplished. And it turns out that one of the major ways in which it was accomplished is that cannabis users, even if they're not under the influence of cannabis, are far more open to novel ideas, and they have a more explorative and reduced anxiety, or I should say lower anxiety mode of thinking when they explore novel ideas, which is essential for divergent thinking. So they observed both enhanced divergent and convergent creative type thinking in cannabis users. And the source of that, they conclude is, and here, I'll just quote, \"Cannabis users' higher levels \"of openness to experience are responsible \"for their enhanced self-reported creativity \"and convergent thinking test performance.\" So it's not necessarily that cannabis is increasing the capacity of the brain areas that are associated with creativity, but rather, cannabis appears to be increasing an openness and probably doing that in part through lowering anxiety in particular people, and that openness is leading to inclusion of more ideas during the divergent thinking process. They're willing to consider throwing up more things on the wall to see if they stick, so to speak. So in their conclusions, they have a really nice statement. Again, I'll just read from the paper, because they said it better than I ever could, quote, \"While mainstream media has propagated the idea \"that cannabis expands the mind and enhances creativity, \"our results show the link between cannabis and creativity \"is largely a spurious correlation,\" meaning that it's not the case that cannabis increases creativity, but, and I inserted the 'but' in this quote, but \"driven by differences in personality \"that are related to cannabis use. \"For example, openness to experience that are related \"to both cannabis use and augmented creativity.\" This is a real chicken/egg argument. What do I mean by that? What I mean is, this paper finds that people who are more open to experience are more likely to use cannabis, and people who use cannabis are going to be more open to new experiences, and that combination of features, openness to experience, and what that openness to new experiences brings, enhances the convergent and divergent thinking that is characteristic of the creative process. So in short, cannabis increases creativity, but through changes in personality that tap into the creative process, rather than directly impacting the neural circuits that, for instance, turn on creativity. And I have to say, this study is really important, because by exploring cannabis users, not while under the influence of cannabis, they were able to tap into this very important, what I believe to be fact. Because if you think about a study in which you would have one group using cannabis and another group not using cannabis, and then you give them some task that taps into creativity, you will see effects and very likely, you'll see effects where cannabis might even increase divergent and convergent thinking and creativity. Those results have actually been published many times before. But given the varied effects of cannabis and THC that we talked about earlier, through all of that complex signaling stuff, you can imagine that there will also be other studies, and in fact, there are, where divergent and convergent thinking and creativity is not assisted by cannabis and might even be reduced by ingesting cannabis. However, if one considers that divergent thinking is absolutely crucial to the creativity process and the range of things that one will explore will be enhanced by openness and by reduced levels of anxiety, so a willingness to explore different options, some of which might seem completely crazy, and cannabis increases the personality types and reduces the anxiety that create that sense of openness, well then it makes perfect sense why cannabis would increase creativity in certain individuals, but not directly. And this study, the one I just referred to, which I should say was published in the journal, \"Consciousness and Cognition,\" and again, we'll provide a link to it, did a wonderful job of teasing out this impact of cannabis on personality, which then impacts creativity. So if somebody asks you, or if you're wondering, or if you feel like cannabis increases creativity, in some sense the answer is 'yes,' but the answer is 'yes' because of the ways that it shapes openness to new ideas and can, I should say 'can,' because not in everybody, but can, in some individuals, reduce anxiety. What this means is that if you are somebody who experiences anxiety or increased levels of focus from cannabis, regardless of the strain, and here I have to imagine people are exploring different strains, if they're exploring them at all, exploring different modes of delivery, smoking or ingestible, et cetera. If you're somebody who experiences anxiety, it's very likely that you won't have the increased openness to experience and divergent ideas that will facilitate creativity. However, if you are somebody who achieves heightened levels of relaxation and reduced levels of anxiety from cannabis, regardless of which strain we happen to be talking about, well then, yes, it will position you to be in a heightened state of creativity, at least as defined by convergent and divergent thinking. One of the more characteristic, or I should say stereotype qualities of people"}
{"question": "Can taking high doses of arginine orally, potentially causing gastrointestinal side effects, still lead to significant increases in growth hormone levels when taken in combination with ornithine?", "doc_id": "x7qbJeRxWGw_28", "video_id": "x7qbJeRxWGw", "video_title": "How to Control Your Metabolism by Thyroid & Growth Hormone", "video_header": "Supplements That Increase Growth Hormone 100-400% (or more): Arginine, Ornithine", "segment_idx": "28", "time_start": "1:14:16", "time_end": "1:18:19", "context": "There are the just tell me what to take people, the people that are really eager to try supplements and maybe in prescription compounds. And then there are people who are a little bit more shy about supplementation. They are more focused on what they can do with diet and behaviors and things of that sort. I don't have a bias either way. I try and offer tools that are supported by the scientific literature. And I always point to safety margins. There are supplements that can increase growth hormone to a considerable degree and no, these aren't growth hormone itself. Although, that of course will increase growth hormone to a considerable degree. We will talk about prescription drugs at the end, not just growth hormone, but some other things that are quite prominently in use right now, in particular in the entertainment industry. There are pretty interesting compounds. But first let's talk about supplements. So this has been known about for some time but arginine, the amino acid arginine, as well as the amino acid ornithine can increase growth hormone levels substantially. Now, arginine has a number of effects. You can get it from food, you can get it from supplements. Some people take it in pill form or capsule form. Some people will actually take it by IV, intravenously. The levels and the amounts of arginine required to get big growth hormone release increases is pretty substantial. So some people will take arginine before bedtime, some people will take it before exercise. The prerequisite again is low blood glucose. Blood glucose is high, it's going to quash the effect. The amounts of arginine that people take are anywhere from three grams to 10 grams, or sometimes even more. Although, this is definitely a case of more is not better. There's a threshold at which growth hormone release is actually blunted by taking more than nine grams of arginine. Now, nine grams of arginine orally is a lot of pills. It's at minimum nine pills. And it can cause some GI disturbance, right? People can feel nauseous. Some people will throw it up. Some people get some constipation or diarrhea, et cetera, or just stomachaches. I'm certainly not suggesting people do this that they take arginine but that's the reason why most of the studies that looked at the role of arginine on growth hormone levels did it by IV, intravenous infusion. So what's interesting, however, is that whether or not it's by mouth or by vein, taking arginine can dramatically increase growth hormone release and the levels or the amount of increase was anywhere from 100 on the low-end but anywhere basically from 400 to 600% above baseline. So these are huge increases in growth hormone. Now, I've never tried arginine. Arginine is out there for a number of different purposes. One of them is to increase growth hormone. Some of the supplements out there to increase growth hormone include arginine and ornithine. Arginine does have the effect of dilating arterials. And it basically increases blood supply. The arginine pathway is involved in vasodilation. It's actually the pathway that's downstream of a lot of drugs that are used to treat things like erectile dysfunction. And anytime people have problems with peripheral blood flow of any kind, they focus on compounds that will either disrupt the enzymes or will adjust the levels of amino acids to get more vasodilation. So taking arginine for the purpose of increasing growth hormone will also have the effect of dilating blood vessels and for people with blood, excuse me, with heart conditions, that actually can be a serious issue. Now, here is something really important and interesting to note, which is that increasing arginine levels"}

I mean, you mentioned this woman who would take these long drives to berate herself. I'm not familiar with that, but I'll, I'll give a little bit of personal disclosure here. I've felt several times in my life that I will start to create a narrative about something that truly hasn't happened about something terrible that somebody is going to do. - Yes. - That's going to upset me. - Yes. - And for the longest time, I wonder why am I doing this? And I have a couple ideas about why, one, is that I was attempting to just avoid thinking about other things. It's just, you know, anger is such an attractive emotional force in this. It's an attracting, it's not attractive. We don't like it. And yet, oftentimes anger is a great way to replace feeling something else. - Yes. - Feeling sad or having to come up or to do work or to do something useful. So it has this kind of a like gravitational force to it. That was one idea. The other idea was in imagining kind of worst outcomes, then actually that relationship were, could actually seem a lot better in reality. - Hm hm. - It's almost like creating this negative contrast. - Yes. It's like, oh, well then it's not that bad. And then the third possibility is I have no idea why, but it seemed like a reflex. And I spent some time thinking about it. I can't say I've resolved it completely, but why would somebody have a narrative or a default narrative when driving or when walking of I'm just going to spend some time and think about how terrible this thing is going to turn out or how someone's going to upset me or harm me or how terrible I am. It seems, again, like maladaptive thinking, maladaptive wiring. And yet I have to assume that it serves some purpose. - Yeah, yeah. I mean, I think there are three factors there and they're all bad. And I think you spoke to at least two of them, right? They I think speak so powerfully to how insidious trauma is and how these are real brain changes inside of us. So I would say that the three factors, punishment, avoidance and control, right? So the trauma inside of us, that makes guilt and shame. So often, so often leads to a desire to punish oneself, right? And the idea that, oh, that was my fault. Or I deserve that. Well, what do we do if something is someone's fault and someone now deserves punishment, right? I mean, we we punish them, right? We send 'em to jail, we give them a fine, right? We punish them. And so what, what we do is punish ourselves, right? And if we tell ourselves we're a loser or this awful thing is going to happen, right? Then part of what we're doing is saying to ourselves, see, right, you deserve that. You're not going to have anything better, right? It's a negative. It's a very negative way that the brain tries to make us in a sense, to do better by hurting us more for the things that we couldn't and shouldn't have been able to, weren't expected to control in the first place, right? The second is distraction. As you said, anger, that kind of fantasy can distract us from affect feeling and emotion. That can be much more negative. Anger, it can be more gratifying than certainly than guilt or shame, although guilt or shame can serve a punishment purpose. But if anger is directed also towards ourselves, right, then it can serve punishment too. So punishment, avoidance, and the sense of control that if you think ahead to something awful, that you're imagining is going to happen, well, maybe that will let you avoid it, right? I mean, you can see the brain here in a sense, really confused. I mean, part of the brain wants to punish. part of the brain doesn't want to think about it at all and part of the brain wants to make it better. And then how all of that resolves, if we're not aware that, hey, this is in the context of our brains being deeply impacted by trauma. So what's going on here is all maladaptive, right? 'Cause these negative fantasies of the future, they may help us feel better about something in the present, but they don't help us make anything better, right? They don't help us make anything better. So this is kind of the sequela. This is where trauma and all this reflexive stuff that happens after trauma ultimately lead us. And you can see how we get lost, how I've seen over and over again in my own life, in the lives of other people, how man we get stuck in those situations and that's why I see people sometimes. This has been going on for 30 years, 40 years, right? And it's just been going on over and over and over again because there's no natural end to any of this, right? Unless we, we look at it in a different way, that we have knowledge and information like, whoa, this isn't the way it has to be. Let me bring a novel perspective to this. It doesn't change on its own. - I'm struck by your statement that these thoughts or behaviors can make us feel better, but they don't actually make anything better. In that way, this mode of imagining terrible outcomes starts to immediately seem like taking opioids. You feel better in the moment, but it doesn't actually make anything better. And it probably makes things worse. - Yes. - And just a question of how much worse and in what direction, yes. And so I just want to just pause on that concept, because I think that concept of makes us feel better, but doesn't make anything better. I think it answers an earlier question about what seems to be a totally maladaptive wiring diagram. We need to confront the thing,"}

because I'm a West Coast guy the Harvard campus and the and the the idea that science has done in a particular way um you know a very brief anecdote you know the folks that founded at The esselin Institute in Big Sur were at Stanford at one point they weren't professors but there's a story and I believe the story that they had proposed at that time um a class on mindfulness and breathing to bring Stan graph through and some other people and this was probably the the late 7s early 80s and whatever the cultural norms were at Stanford at that time they claimed they were basically runoff campus went and started esselin I don't know if it's a true story but I like the story anyway my lab at Stanford ran a study on particular patterns of breathing along with David Spiegel and how it can be used to you know self adjust stress levels and reduce stress levels okay so now and nowadays there's grants given for this kind of stuff and meditation so there's been a huge shift in the in the in the academic cultural millu but given that you've been running these sorts of you know seeing what may be types of studies for a number of years at a campus that I consider as more kind of like East Coast died in the wool Notions of how science is done I want to know a how was it received early on B did you care C is it in your nature and has it always been in your nature to kind of test the elements because I sense but I could be completely wrong because I'm not a psychologist that that you Delight in kind of um not poking the bear but playing with ideas that are um kind of heretical well I would use the methods of the field it was just the questions that were different so they weren't seen to to be quite as different as you're uh suggesting did any of your colleagues think like like great okay no I love hearing that because it shatters my Notions of of kind of um East Coast I League AC I mean perhaps behind my back but well clearly it's worked out and nowadays you know there are multiple Labs at Harvard working on happiness you know working on mindfulness and I mean you've pioneered an entire field and a way but I'm more interested in the way of thinking um that was the the so it's interesting 8-year-old Ellen Langer like well maybe cookies are the the nutritious stuff you I know I understand so I seem to be um you know come hella high water I'm going to do it I'm not like that at all more now that I'm older but I tell a story um I don't remember what the point of it the exact point was in the mindful body where I'm met the dentist I'm a little kid I don't remember how old and I remember my mother came in and the dentist told my mother what a patient I was and all I remember was my saying what were the other kids doing you know so it wasn't as if I made a choice I could do this or I could do you know it never occurred to me and so lots of these ideas you know are not um against or what you know I don't know where they come from I know Lee Ross when you know so Lee was a professor at Stanford and I remember having a conversation where he said Ellen you know you're from Mars and I said said I I'm Not So Different he says okay so you're a normal not an exceptional Martian but you're still a martian um and then a colleague um had a conversation with and and I was flattered by this but I think it it wasn't meant to be flattering because they were worried what my reaction was was that you know I'm from a different uh time um and you know so that plays differently if you're aware you know so like when I started painting um you know um I was breaking the rules to some people's minds but no I didn't know the rule and so I was just doing what felt natural I have to introduce you to my good friend Rick Rubin who's been on this podcast a few times because he he wrote the creative act he's he's basically his life has been spent you know trying to pull out the best creative works from musicians and and he's been involved in other things too and he's just has a you know a kind of Supernatural level of ability to do this he keeps coming back to this thing in our discussions but also in his book and and elsewhere about how the the the impediment the greatest impediment to the creative process is to think about the publicity or cultural milu that it's going to exist in that he really believes that that these things are offerings to to the to God to the universe to whatever um that come through us and that the the barrier is the the it's almost like the self-awareness is the barrier so uh one of the earlier titles of the mindful body was who says so love it and you know realizing that everything that is was at one point a decision made by people with different motives different histories different needs um and um when you put people as I say back in the equation everything becomes mutable everything you know so and so there are thing here's where I am different from uh from many other people better or worse my think in this case for better you know that I everything can be changed you know you tell me you meet this you know this woman and she's too heavy weight can be lost hair can be grown everything can be changed so I I'd give a talk when I was very young and I um I'm here on the stage and you know the audience is all the way back here and I knew that was going to make me nervous so what I did was move all the chairs to be closer to me now if you said to anybody can you move the chairs everybody would say of course but mindlessly it doesn't occur to you it doesn't occur to you that what is doesn't have to be as it is and it you know uh the older I get the uh the more malleable everything seems to be even a thing you know to go back I don't know why this comes to mind but it does um if um an insurance company is making a decision about what drugs to insure now who said that this disorder is better or more worthy than that dis I say so these are people making this decision so imagine that you have a group of nuns they're the committee making the decision versus a group of Lusty 50-year-old men and they're deciding whether people should be reimbursed for um Viagra for example you and that's what it's all about you know that when you recognize that whatever is could be different is meetings and I I deal with this uh when I give lectures you know at some point I might say uh look in the audience and see if there's usually a man is there a man here it's about 65 somebody always there I don't know why six5 men find me attractive I don't know what anyway invite him to the stage and then we look ridiculous I'm 53 he's 65 and um I ask him to put his hand he puts his hand up his hand is three inches larger than mine and then I just raised the question should we do anything physical the same and it's ridiculous you know but one of us is teaching how to do it you know so the more different you are from the person who wrote the rule the more important it is for you not to mindlessly follow the rule so you don't hold the tennis racket like this if your hand is half the size of the person who or twice the size or you or anything else and people don't realize it that everything that is was a decision for something to be a decision means there was uncertainty as soon as the decision is made we forget all that uncertainty and act as if this is the way it's supposed to be an example I often use you know tennis so you have and everybody when you think about this and nobody's going to argue that of course the rules to tennis weren't handed down from the heavens somebody decided it should be two serves and that's fine but for me three serves would be better the first time I kill it doesn't go in now I'm afraid to try to kill it again and learn from that because I don't want to double fold so I have a little wuss second surf if I had three surfs I kill it it doesn't go and now I learn from that I kill it again but I'm getting a little better and I still have my backup third Serve All right so what is the point of that that if I wrote the rules to the game I would be a better tennis player you would be better at whatever you you're writing the rules to so you think differently about yourself you don't feel bad about it in fact you know when people play tennis with me we often play three servs why not you know everything about it is up for grabs and um you know so what happens is the lower down you are on the totem pole the fewer of these things games ways of being that you yourself have created the more you're trying to fit yourself into some form that um isn't so comfortable so we need to appreciate that rules laws everything was just somebody's decision about how things should be and you know don't violate them purposely but if they don't fit um you know legality is not the same thing as morality you know by law one was not allowed interracial marriage by law one was not allowed to be gay by law law you know so on and so forth one wasn't allowed to drink at one point and so on these are not moral issues these are a group of people who are making a decision for the rest of us if it doesn't hurt fine but um you know if it does fight it deviate at least live the life you want to live I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors function"}

enhance training by taking certain things before we train and I also have the question of how long before training should we start thinking about supplying nutrients and supplements for the training session I'm not sure I actually finished my five or maybe I wasn't clear enough about the last one so I just want to tie that that bow and then we'll go next one yeah no it was probably my fault so that uh in addition to the Galpin equation in terms of amount I Amic recommended a you know roughly 3 to one sodium to potassium recommendation and I gave you some rough numbers for things to like that I actually in all honesty use probably six to 10 different electrolyte companies depending on the situation some of them are really good in the case again like element that's nice about that is there's no carbohydrate however the downside is there's no carbohydrate so some sometimes I want carbohydrates in the training because as you mentioned there's significant evidence going back actually several decades on the benefit of carbohydrate during exercise so if you're in a situation uh where you're trying to again maximize actual exercise performance you especially if it is either long duration so more than two hours or extremely high intensity and this has to be well north of 100% of your V2 Max in that situation as we talked about in the endurance episode you can actually start having a decrement in performance because of a drop of muscle glycogen uh G glycogen can start coming down if that's the case augmenting with the carbohydrates during the training that is going to enhance performance it's going to do what we call spare the liver and it's going to keep my second rule of my four which is maintain glucose ingestion it's going to keep that going in general what you're going to find is the number is like a 5 to 9% glucose concentration in your fluid which turns out to be like exactly the number that most sports drinks have as well as I think that's pretty much exactly what coconut water is the downside of sports drinks since we're here is they actually tend to be undersalted and so that they don't provide enough of them if you look at the numbers they're going to say something like 60 to 100 gram of carbohydrate per hour is the Target and now if you're using the sort of gallin equation and you're splitting that up into 15 uh minute intervals it's something again like 20 or so grams of carbs per 15 to 20 minutes if you're doing again an hourong plus training valow so admittedly 100 grams uh is a bit much for some folks depending on your size so I would recommend starting in that uh 60 gram or so range again per hour total is what you want to get to and only in the situation in which muscle glycogen depletion is becoming a limiting factor to Performance so the other benefit of that is as you mentioned that actually drives water into the cell and so you're going to be in that nice sweet lot of you're actually keeping glucose going which is going to enhance performance and you're helping hydration at the same time so the other little part that's important to pay attention to here is the type of carbohydrate matters um so you can use actually a whole combination of things called resistant starches which I will use for a long bouts of exercise but in the middle of the workout you're going to want to focus on glucose and fructose mostly glucose typically at least a two or 3 to1 ratio of glucose to fructose and the reason is those actually get into tissue through separate Transporters and so what happens is once the glucose Transporters get full you can't bring anything else in however since fructose comes in a separate route you can maximize total carbohydrate intake by using two different unique forms there there's a lot of ways you can do this um but this is where the momentus fuel product is is like specifically has that exactly in it so it's fantastic um you can use food no problem you can use a combination of things like honey and and different easily uh absorbable and usable and things you can actually like maybe put in a drink um to get away with so there's lots of routes for it but you want to look in that that sort of combination uh of 5 to 9% roughly glucose for there so you do need to train your gut so do not do anything and there's a generally A good rule do not do anything in your competition that you've never done in practice so try these food items try these amounts the carbohydrate numbers try the sodium numbers try the total amount of water start low you can always increase what you don't want to do is have to run out during the middle of your spin class and Sprint to the bathroom and hope nobody's in your way uh which uh in the lab we've seen we'll just say

{"question": "What is the concept of dermatomes and how does it relate to the way our body surface is divided into different territories that can be affected by various stimuli, such as pain, temperature, or chemical stimuli?", "doc_id": "xmhsWAqP_0Y_5", "video_id": "xmhsWAqP_0Y", "video_title": "How to Control Your Sense of Pain & Pleasure", "video_header": "Two-Point Discrimination, Dermatomes", "segment_idx": "5", "time_start": "22:16", "time_end": "28:07", "context": "by doing a simple experiment that we call two-point discrimination. Two-points discrimination is your ability to know whether or not two points of pressure are far apart, near each other, or you actually could perceive incorrectly as one point of pressure. You might want a second person to do this experiment. Here's how you would do it. You will close your eyes, that person would take two fine points. Don't make them too sharp, please. So it could be two pencils or pens or the backs of pens. Two pens I'm holding in my hands. If you're just listening to this, I'm just holding two pens. My favorite pens, these pilot, V5 or V7, which I love. If you were to close your eyes and I were to take these two pens and put their points close together about a centimeter apart and present them to the top of your hand, I'm going to just going to do that now to myself. You, even though your eyes were closed, you would be able to perceive that that was two points of pressure presented simultaneously to the top of your hand. However, if I were to do this to the middle of your back, you would not experience them as two points of pressure. You would experience them as one single point of pressure. In other words, your two point discrimination is better, is higher on areas of your body which have many, many more sensory receptors. You are more sensitive at those locations. Now this makes perfect sense once you experience it or you hear about it. However, most of us don't really appreciate how important and what a profound influence this change in density of receptors across our body surface has. And we can go a step further and describe another feature of the way that you're built and the way that you experience pleasure and pain, which is called the dermatome. The dermatome is literally the way in which your body surface is carved up into different territories. Much like a map of the United States is carved up into different territories of states and counties, et cetera. The dermatome is the way in which neurons connect to different parts of your body. Now, you've actually experienced the dermatome before. The dermatome is when you have a neuron that connects to a particular area of the body and that neuron doesn't just send one little wire out like one little line and go up into the skin to detect mechanical, or thermal, or chemical stimuli. It actually sends many branches out like a tree. But remember those branches of the tree come from one single neuron. Now, occasionally what will happen is you will experience something like cold, or heat, or pain, or tingling on a patch of your body. And occasionally that patch of body will actually have a very cleanly demarcated boundary, a very stark boundary with the areas around it. A good example of this would be the herpes simplex 1 virus, which if one has this virus, and I should mention that somewhere between 80 and 90% of people have this virus, this is not a sexually transmitted virus. This is a virus is transmitted very easily between people through various forms of contact non-sexual contact, it's present in children, it's present in adults and most people get it, some get symptoms and some don't some get recurring symptoms, some don't. We can talk about that at the end, if you like, but this virus lives on what's called the fifth cranial nerve also called the trigeminal nerve. The trigeminal nerve sends branches out to the lips, to the eyes, and to certain portions of the face. So for those of you listening, I've just kind of put my right hand across my face and to sort of simulate the three branches, the trigeminal aspect of this nerve. So tri three. Now, when the herpes virus flares up, as they say, in response to stress or other factors, the virus inflames that nerve and people experience tingling and pain on the nerve. Sometimes they'll get a cold sore or a blister on their lip or near their mouth, sometimes they'll get a collection of those. And that's because that dermatome is actually inflamed. Now other people will experience something like shingles. It's a fairly common viral infection. And what they'll notice is they'll get a rash that has a boundary. It's like, they'll get a bunch of bumps, sometimes blisters, and it'll have a sharp boundary. That boundary exists because the virus exists on the nerve. And so it actually is boundaried with the neighboring area of the body that's receiving input from another nerve and that one doesn't have the virus living on it. So anytime you see a rash or a pattern on the body surface on the skin that has a pretty stark boundary, chances are that's an event that's impacting the dermatome. I've experienced this before then not through herpes simplex, but through the experience of having a lot of blood sort of aggregating in a kind of a segment across the front of my face, it was really bizarre. I looked in the mirror and I thought, what is going on here? I was having an allergic reaction to something I'd eaten. And that allergic reaction clearly was affecting one of the nerves and therefore the dermatome and what it showed up was, it was almost like someone had drawn lines on my face that said, okay, this rash or this reaction rather can happen here, but not in a region right next to it. Whenever you see that chances are it's a reaction of the nerves of the dermatome. So you'll start to see these things more and more when you start to look for them. You don't always have to have a viral infection to experience this. Sometimes you'll just experience tingling or even a pleasant sensation, and it will be restricted in kind of a strict boundary on one location or your body surface and not another. Not corresponding to an organ like, okay, this arm or just your feet or something like that. But just a segment. It's almost like someone outlined a particular area of her body surface. That's the dermatome. So you've got sensors in the skin and you've got a brain that's going to interpret what's going on with those sensors."}
{"question": "What are the three neural circuits within the brain that work together to facilitate the creative process, and how do each of these circuits contribute to the creation of novel and useful ideas?", "doc_id": "KPlJcD-o-4Q_4", "video_id": "KPlJcD-o-4Q", "video_title": "The Science of Creativity & How to Enhance Creative Innovation | Huberman Lab Podcast 103", "video_header": "Neural Circuits of Creativity", "segment_idx": "4", "time_start": "23:41", "time_end": "31:50", "context": "of some elements could be notes of music, could be numbers, could be visual elements like lines or colors, could be physical movements, et cetera. But novel combinations of some things that reveal to us something fundamental about the way that our brain and/or the world work. And of course, as I mentioned before, that fundamental thing may or may not be consciously accessible to us. We may not know what exactly it is that's novel to us. But it feels novel and it feels true. Well, with that understanding in mind, we therefore can ask, what are the underlying principles and neural circuits that underlie the creative process. And the word process here is especially important. In fact, if there's one thing I'd really like to impress on everybody is that when thinking about biology, it's almost always better to think about verbs as opposed to nouns. So rather than think of creativity as a noun or somebody being creative as an adjective, think about the verb creativity. That is what are the steps required and therefore what are the cells and circuits and thoughts, et cetera required in order to be creative. This element of thinking about verbs then allows us to say, OK, what are the various steps in coming up with a creative idea, in testing a creative idea, and then implementing that creative idea. And in doing so, we find based on the scientific literature that there are basically three major networks within the brain, each of which is responsible for each of the three steps to arrive at something truly creative. The first neural circuit involved in creativity is the so-called executive network. This is a goofy name because the neural circuits that I'm about to describe do a bunch of other things as well, but they certainly control what are called executive functions. Executive functions are functions that you and I both have, which is our ability to govern our thinking and our behavior in very deliberate ways. And that is largely accomplished through the use of the neural circuitry that sits right behind the forebrain, the so-called prefrontal cortex. Now, the prefrontal cortex involves many different subregions. It has a bunch of different parts just like any country has different states, et cetera and provinces. Executive function involves the prefrontal cortex and some other neural structures. But for the sake of this discussion, executive function and the prefrontal cortex are mainly responsible for suppressing action. That is, for eliminating choices among the infinite number of choices that exist. For instance, of what colors to combine on a painting or what lines to draw or what notes to play or what movements to make in a sports endeavor, what numbers to include in a mathematics endeavor, or what words and letters and syllables and sentences to include in writing a creative passage. The second network is the so-called default mode network. There's a lot of discussion nowadays about the default mode network as it relates to consciousness and meditation, et cetera. The default mode network does many different things. But in the context of our discussion about creativity, the default mode network is really the network that starts being engaged when you close your eyes and start paying attention to what's going on in terms of your thinking as opposed to the sensory outside world. And the default mode network is especially important for what's called spontaneous imagination. Now, spontaneous imagination is something that you can try at any moment if you were to close your eyes and to try and not pay attention to the sounds around you. But even if you do, to just pay attention to whatever thoughts or feelings emerge when your eyes are closed. By closing your eyes and shutting yourself off to the outside sensory world, you start to engage much more of your brain machinery dedicated towards what's going on inside you, so-called interoception but also what you're thinking about your thinking whether or not your thoughts are complete or incomplete, whether or not they are fragmentary in a way that goes from one thought to another distantly in the past or present to future, et cetera. Depending on time of day, how well-rested you are, how stressed you are, how happy you are, the default mode network will take you through a journey of different types of thoughts, different types of feelings, et cetera. The specific types of thoughts and feelings are not as interesting as the fact that when you close your eyes you're essentially engaging this default mode network, which is essentially the network associated with imagination and imagination based on elements that exist only within your head, that is within your brain and therefore must rely on memory of previous experiences. As soon as you close your eyes, you are shutting yourself off from the sensory world. So by definition you can no longer be bringing in novel experiences in that moment. You're relying on your library of existing experiences and your memory of those in order to imagine new things. And you're doing this in a very free associative way. You're not trying to imagine new things. It's just whatever geysers to the surface. So we've got the executive network, which is involved in suppressing particular thoughts or actions. We have the default mode network, which is involved in imagination. And the default mode network I should mention also involves a subregion of the prefrontal cortex. It's called the medial prefrontal cortex but other brain regions as well. And then the final element within the circuits underlying creativity is the so-called salience network. The salience network is a network of brain regions that involves areas such as the Insula, which actually has a complete map of your body surface as well as some information mapped there about what's going on in the outside world and how those combined with what's going on in your internal landscape, that is within your body. Also a brain region called the ACC or intengu-- excuse me, anterior cingulate cortex and the amygdala. So a lot of information is mapped within the salience network about how we feel and how we feel in relation to things that are happening around us and within us. And the salience network has one main job, which is to pay attention to what's most interesting either in the world or inside us in terms of feelings or experiences. So we've got three networks-- executive network, which is there to suppress choices in terms of actions we could take but decide not to, or things we could think about but choose not to or try not to, the default mode network, which is basically the catalog or library of previous experiences that we have available to us that would act as the paints on a palette or the possible ingredients that could go into a recipe. All of that has to, again, arise from previous experience. We can't close our eyes and suddenly be able to access all the melodies that we've never heard before or all our ideas and concepts and knowledge about music if we don't have musical understanding or visual understanding. So we're really drawing up the library. And that library tends to be rather disorganized. It swirls around. It's not very structured unless we're actively trying to think about something. And then we have the salience network, which is the networks within the brain that decide or make choices about what's most interesting to pay attention to in a given moment. So those three networks work together to create things. And when I say create things, we again have to really definition of creativity. Creativity is a rearrangement of existing elements into novel combinations that reveal something fundamental about how we or the world works. And, this is very important. It tends to be things that are useful. Now, they can merely be useful because they're entertaining or thrilling, they can also have a particular utility or use in the world like a piece of technology that is actually useful like an app or a smartphone or a computer actually has utility or a vehicle. There are creative acts that led to the formation of vehicles and computers, et cetera. But the point is that just merely coming up with novel combinations of things like wings on a fish tank, that's not creative or it's not creative in any meaningful way because it's simply not useful. It doesn't reveal anything fundamental new or purposeful. It doesn't allow us to think about or interact with the world or ourselves in novel ways. Whereas things, people, actions, and ideas that are truly creative really change the way that we are able to access the world. They act as portals to the world and to ourselves."}
{"question": "Is the hippocampus involved in storing long-term memories, or does it primarily serve as an intermediate storage area?", "doc_id": "099hgtRoUZw_4", "video_id": "099hgtRoUZw", "video_title": "Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Boost Attention & Memory with Science-Based Tools | Huberman Lab Podcast #73", "video_header": "Encoding Long-Term Memory", "segment_idx": "4", "time_start": "16:24", "time_end": "18:45", "context": "A few years ago, the theme in various high-profile reviews seemed to be that the hippocampus was involved in encoding, in creating memories, but not in storing memories and that the memory storage was in the neocortex or the other overlying areas of the brain. Is that too general a statement? - That's a tricky statement because I think that ultimately, yes, that long-term memories are stored in the cortex, but those memories are stored in the hippocampus sometimes for a very, very long time. So how long is too long where you say, oh, it's not the hippocampus anymore? If it's four years, does that mean that it's not stored in the hippocampus? I think that's a tricky question. And yes, it was coming up a lot because people were debating it and some people did think that you shouldn't think about the hippocampus as a storage area, but I think it's a long, long, long-term kind of intermediate storage area, maybe not the long-term storage area. That's why it's hard to answer that question. - Great, as I recall, HM could remember facts from before his surgery. - Yes. - He couldn't form new memories. - Correct. - And given that he had no hippocampus, it would at least partially support the idea that some memories are retained outside the hippocampus. - However, he did have part of his posterior hippocampus intact. So that's the tricky thing. I think initially, in fact, Scoville, the neurosurgeon overestimated the number of millimeters he intended to remove of the hippocampus. And then when they did this, the very historic MRI of HM later in his life, they showed that, in fact, he did have that part of the posterior hippocampus intact. So now it makes it a little bit more complicated to interpret what's going on. Not that it was never uncomplicated, any interpretation of a lesion in a patient, as you know, is complicated, but HM had this mythical role in neuroscience and neurology and now it was complicated because he does have more of the hippocampus intact. - Got it, I did not know that.

{"question": "How can I incorporate play into my daily life to improve my cognitive abilities and overall brain health, and what are some specific examples of playful activities that can help me engage in neuroplasticity?", "doc_id": "BwyZIWeBpRw_12", "video_id": "BwyZIWeBpRw", "video_title": "Using Play to Rewire & Improve Your Brain", "video_header": "Play Is THE Portal to Neuroplasticity", "segment_idx": "12", "time_start": "1:00:04", "time_end": "1:04:41", "context": "another one of the top 10 questions I get is how can I keep my brain young? How can I continue to learn? How can I get better in school and sport in life and relationships, et cetera, emotionally, cognitively, and on and on and on. And yes, there are supplements that can support neuroplasticity. Yes, there are brain games and apps that can support neuroplasticity. But if you really want to engage neuroplasticity at any age, what you need to do is return to the same sorts of practices and tools that your nervous system naturally used throughout development. And it evolved over hundreds of thousands of years to trigger this thing that we call neuroplasticity. And the reason this is so important is because it starts to move us away from what some people call hacks. I define hacks as using one thing for a different purpose to kind of get a shortcut. I don't really like the term, frankly, and I don't like it because it's not grounded in any biological mechanism. But when we look at play, we can say, play is the portal to plastic. Play at every stage of life is the way in which we learned the rules for that stage of life. And play is the way in which we were able to test how we might function in the real world context. So play is powerful. And we could even say that play is the most powerful portal to plasticity. The reason for that is that yes, this high opioid, low epinephrine or adrenaline state is what opens up play. But then inside of the arena of play, when the prefrontal cortex is running all these different possibilities in this low stakes way. But with some degree of focus, there are a number of other chemicals that are deployed. Things like Brain-derived neurotrophic factor and other growth factors that actually trigger the rewiring of brain circuits that allow for it to expand. And indeed that's what is neuroplasticity. If you're interested in those chemicals and kind of arena of things that happen when one engages in neuroplasticity, there's a vast literature out there. But one of the more popular books that I think is quite good is from my friend and colleague, John Ratey, who's a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School. That's R A T E Y. He wrote the book \"Spark\" a few years back, and I think it's still very relevant. And John talks about the important role that play exerts in the neuroplasticity process and points to a number of different protocols that one can engage in. He also points to the importance of navigating new environments to not just go on the same hike every week, or take the same walk, but actually get into new novel environments. So you're starting to sense a theme here. There's novelty, exploring contingencies, keeping the stakes relatively low, et cetera, et cetera. But these really are the gates to this holy grail that we call neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity as I've talked about in the podcast before is a two step process. It involves focusing very intensely or at least focusing somewhat on whatever it is that one is trying to learn, and then engaging in deep rest, ideally deep sleep in the following nights. And I've also talked about the benefits of things like naps and Yoga Nidra so-called NSDR, Non Sleep Deep Rest for enhancing or accelerating plasticity. You can check out the episodes on Focus at hubermanlab.com or the episodes on How to Learn Faster. The detail all of those. We had a newsletter that lists out all the tools for neuroplasticity enhancing neuroplasticity, all that is available. Zero cost to you at hubermalab.com, et cetera. You can just download that information, but John's book that newsletter those episodes. They really point to this two step process where it's focus and then rest focus and then rest and play is its own unique form of focus and then rest, focus and rest. It's not the same as learning something for sake of school or critically trying to learn a motor behavior for sake of sport. It's really about expanding the number of things that you could learn down the line. Okay, so said once again. So I just want to make sure it's abundantly clear play is about establishing a broader framework within which you can learn new things. It's not about learning some specific thing. It's not about the game you happen to be playing. It's not about the dollhouse that the kids are playing with so that they can become amazing dollhouse players when they grow up. Right. The dirt Clod war that I referred to earlier for better or for worse was not about becoming the best dirt clod thrower or winning the trophy for dirt clods in the neighborhood. Although we actually had a trophy for the best dirt clod team. Alas, it was not my team that year. But the point is that you're learning rules and establishing a broader foundation of practices that then can learn more things within that context. Thus far I've tried to convince you"}
{"question": "Can psychedelics, such as MDMA and psilocybin, be a useful tool for personal growth and spiritual exploration, and how do they intersect with the concept of meditation?", "doc_id": "-wIt_WsJGfw_23", "video_id": "-wIt_WsJGfw", "video_title": "Dr. Sam Harris: Using Meditation to Focus, View Consciousness & Expand Your Mind | Huberman Lab 105", "video_header": "Psychedelics, MDMA & Experiences in Consciousness, Religion", "segment_idx": "23", "time_start": "3:05:59", "time_end": "3:21:07", "context": "that meditation is not about changing the content of conscious experience. And in a different podcast that you were on, I heard you say something to the effect of that normally we are in our daily experience and unless we are trained in meditation, unless we've dissolved this illusion of the gap between actor and self and observer, that we require certain sensory events to create collisions within us and with the natural world that sort of blast us into a different mode of being. I want to use that as a way to frame up this idea that some things such as psychedelics but also a very long hike, a very long fast, who knows? A banquet, different types of life experiences do exactly the opposite of what you're describing meditation does, which is that they actively change the content of our conscious experience so much so that we often remember those for the rest of our lives. Could you tell us why psychedelics can be useful? And here, I'll give the caveats that maybe you'll feel obligated to give as well, but we're talking about safely and responsibly, age-appropriate, context-appropriate, ideally with some clinical or other type of guidance, legality issues, obeyed, et cetera. All that stated, it was psychedelics to me are an experience of altered perception, internal and external perception, altered space time relationship, somewhat dreamlike. I think it was Alan Hobson at Harvard for a long time talked about the relationship between psychedelic-like states and dream-like states because of this distortion of space time dimensionality. And I haven't experimented with them much. I've been part of a clinical trial, three doses of MDMA, which certainly altered the quality of my conscious experience in ways that led to a lot of lasting and at least for me, valuable learning. So what are your what are your thoughts about psychedelics in terms of how they intersect with the discussion that we've been having? And what utility do they play in recognition of the self or in other sorts of brain changes? SAM HARRIS: Well so, let's just price in all those caveats that people can anticipate. These drugs are not without their risks. And one problem is that we have this single-term drugs or psychedelics, which names many different types of substances, and they're not all the same. So like, MDMA is not even technically a psychedelic. I think it has immense therapeutic value, and it actually was my gateway drug to this whole area of concern. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amphetamine pathogen, right? It's a sort of an amphetamine and a pathogen at the same time. SAM HARRIS: Yeah, I mean it's, often called-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: M pathogens. SAM HARRIS: Yeah, and a pathogen-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not a pathogen, M pathogen. SAM HARRIS: And a pathogen or an entactogen, it's been called. But it doesn't tend to change perception in the way that classic psychedelics do. And it's also serotonergic, but it has to be in some part differently. And even LSD and psilocybin, which are much more similar and classic psychedelics, both are also serotonergic but they're not merely, and they're also different. And the higher dose you take of these drugs, the more-- at lower doses everything, can kind of seem the same. At higher doses, they begin to diverge. And we can talk about the pharmacology if you wanted to. But I would just say that for many of us, and certainly for me, psychedelics were indispensable in the beginning in proving to me that this was-- the first person interrogation of the mind was worth doing. Because I was somebody who at age 17 or 18, before I had any real experience with MDMA or LSD or psilocybin, if you had taught me how to meditate at that point, I think I would have just bounced off the whole project. I think I was so cerebral in just my engagement with anything. I was so skeptical of any of the religious and spiritual traditions that have given us most of our meditation talk that I think I just would have-- And I know many of these people. I have tried to teach Richard Dawkins to meditate and Daniel Dennett to meditate. I've ambushed them with meditation both in a group setting and one-on-one. Not Dan but Richard, I ambushed on my own podcast with a guided meditation. And he closes his eyes, he looks inside, and there's nothing of interest to see. He doesn't have the conceptual interest in him that would cause him to persist long enough to find out that there's a there there. Now, this is not a problem with LSD or psilocybin or MDMA. I know that if I gave him 100 micrograms of LSD or 5 grams of mushrooms or 25 milligrams of psilocybin-- that's probably not the analogous dosage to the 5 grams of mushrooms. 5 grams of mushrooms would be more than that. I forget what it is of MDMA, maybe 120 milligrams. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I think the maps dose, which is the one that's under clinical trials is 125 milligrams with an option of a 75 milligram booster. Funny, I remember it. SAM HARRIS: Yeah, that's strange, the facts that come to hand. But there's just no possibility that nothing's going to happen right now. Something with a psychedelic, with MDMA, most people tend to have certainly under any kind of guidance, tend to have a very positive, pro-social experience. But with a psychedelic, you might have a somewhat terrifying experience if you have quote, a bad trip. And I've certainly had those experiences on LSD and to some degree, on psilocybin. But the prospect that nothing is going to happen is just in nearly a million cases out of a million just not in the cards. I mean, just neurophysiologically, something is going to happen with the requisite dose of one of these drugs. And if that thing that happens is psychologically at all normative and pleasant and interesting and valuable, which it is so much of the time and certainly under the appropriate set and setting and guidance, it can be a lot of the time for virtually everybody. Again, there are caveats. If you're prone, if you think you have a proclivity for schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, this is almost certainly not for you. And anyone doing the studies at Johns Hopkins for the therapeutic effects of any of these drugs, they're there ruling out people with-- first degree relatives with any of these clinical conditions. So for somebody like me at 18 who didn't know that this was an area of not only interest but would it be the center of gravity for the rest of his life, if only he could pay attention clearly enough to see that it could be, I was someone who very likely-- again, I don't have the counterfactual in hand. I don't know what would have happened if someone had forced me to meditate for an hour at that point. But I know I wasn't interested in it until I took MDMA. I know I wasn't having these kinds of experiences spontaneously that showed me that there was an inner landscape that was worth exploring. I was a very hard-headed skeptic who was very interested in lots of things, but there was no alternative to me just thinking more about those things. I mean, the idea that there's some other way of grasping cognitively at the interesting parts of the world beyond thinking about the world, that just wouldn't have computed for me at all. No one ever gave me a book to read or I never had-- The noun, meditation, very likely meant absolutely nothing to me before I took my first dose of, in this case it was MDMA. So what the drug experience did for me is it just proved-- So one of the limitations of drug is that, obviously, no matter how good the experience, the drug wears off and then you're back to in more or less your usual form, and now you have a memory of the experience. And it can be a fairly dim memory. I mean, some of these experiences are so discontinuous with normal waking consciousness that it can be like trying to remember a dream that just degrades over the course of seconds. And then it could have been the most intense dream you've ever had and for whatever reason, you can barely get a purchase on what it was about. And there are some psychedelic experiences that are analogous to that. But for most people most of the time, there's a residue of this experience. And with something like MDMA, they can be quite vivid. Where you recognize there was a way of being that is quite different than what I'm tending to access by default, and it is different in ways that are just obviously better and psychologically more healthy. I mean, it's possible to be healthy psychologically in a way that I never imagined. And then when you link it up to the traditional literature around any of this stuff, again, so much of it is shot through with superstition and other worldliness of religion. And as you know and I think you're listeners probably know, I've spent a lot of time criticizing all that. But there is a baby in the bathwater to all of that. It's not that somebody like Jesus or the Buddha or any of the matriarchs and patriarchs of the world's religions, it's not that they were all conscious frauds or temporal lobe epileptics, there's a pathological lens that you can put on top of all that. But once you have one of these experiences on psychedelics or on a drug like MDMA, you know that there's a there there. You know that unconditional love is a possibility. You know that feeling truly one with nature. I mean, just so one with nature that you could spend 10 hours in front of a tree and find that to be the most rewarding experience of your life. That's a possible state of consciousness. Now, it may not be the state of consciousness you want all the time. You don't want to be the crazy guy by the tree you know who can't have a conversation about anything else. But once you have one of these experiences, you recognize, OK, there's some reason why I'm not having the beatific vision right now. And I can't even figure out how to aim my attention so as to have anything like it. And that's a problem, because it's available, and it is among the best things that has ever happened to me. And now I can just only dimly remember what that was like. So how do I get back there on some level? So that invites, again, a logic of changes. A logic of seeking changes in the contents of consciousness, which sets someone up for this protracted or seemingly protracted and fairly frustrating search to game their nervous system so as to have those kinds of experiences more and more. And again, it's not that that's in principle fruitless but it is from the point of view of the core insight, the core wisdom of what I would take from a tradition like Buddhism, which is not the only tradition that has given voice to this, but I would argue it's given it voice to it in the most articulate way. Again, leaving aside any of the superstition and other worldliness and miracles that we don't have to talk about at the moment. And you certainly don't need to endorse in order to be interested in this stuff. And so that's the bifurcation between all of the utility of psychedelics and what I'm talking about under the rubric of meditation is at this point of OK, once you realize there's a there there, what do you do? And what's the logic by which you're led to do it? And it's possible if you're only framework is the good experiences, the good feels you had on whatever drug it was and a further discussion of what that path of changes can look like-- and that can become in a religious context, it can come in just a purely psychedelic context or some combination of the two. I think you can be misled to just seek lots of peak experiences. You're just trying to string together a lot of peak experiences hoping they're going to change you, every one of which, by definition is going to be impermanent. It's first it wasn't there, then it's there, and then it's no longer there. And then you've got a memory of it. What I think what everyone really"}
{"question": "What is the ideal duration for a learning session to achieve significant plasticity in the nervous system, especially for adults learning a new skill like an instrument?", "doc_id": "hx3U64IXFOY_16", "video_id": "hx3U64IXFOY", "video_title": "Using Failures, Movement & Balance to Learn Faster", "video_header": "Failure Specificity Triggers Specific Plastic Changes", "segment_idx": "16", "time_start": "38:54", "time_end": "40:19", "context": "And so this is really the key element of incremental learning, is that you're trying to signal to the nervous system at least one component that needs to change. The nervous system needs to know what the error is. Now, when I shoot free throws, Lord knows there are a lot of different kinds of errors that happen, probably the way I'm bending my knees, the arc of the ball, the way I'm organizing my shoulders, probably where my eyes are, lots of things. So which ones to focus on? And that's what I said before, the beauty of the motor system is I don't have to worry about all of that. I just need to get the reps in a number of times, and the nervous system will figure out how far off my motor commands are, at the level of these maps that I described earlier, how far those deviate from the desired behavior, getting the ball into the basket, and it will start making adjustments. But as I make adjustments, or as my nervous system makes adjustments for me, the key thing is to not start adding a variety of new errors because then it gets confused. And so this is why short learning bouts are absolutely essential. So let's say it's for learning an instrument as an adult. Probably anywhere from 7 minutes to 30 minutes, provided that you're fully attending, you're very focused, is going to be a pretty significant stimulus to inspire plasticity in the nervous system. Now, there is one way to get a lot of plasticity all at once as an adult. There is that kind of Holy Grail thing of getting massive plasticity"}
{"question": "How will virtual reality and augmented reality technologies merge to create a new, immersive experience that seamlessly blends the physical and digital worlds?", "doc_id": "1Wo6SqLNmLk_18", "video_id": "1Wo6SqLNmLk", "video_title": "Mark Zuckerberg & Dr. Priscilla Chan: Curing All Human Diseases & the Future of Health & Technology", "video_header": "Virtual Reality (VR), Mixed Reality Experiences & Smart Glasses", "segment_idx": "18", "time_start": "1:28:58", "time_end": "1:36:07", "context": "which I only had the chance to try for the first time today, is your new VR platform, the newest Oculus. And then we can talk about the glasses, the Ray-Bans. MARK ZUCKERBERG: Sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Those two experiences are still kind of blowing my mind, especially the Ray-Ban glasses. And I have so many questions about this. So I'll resist. But-- MARK ZUCKERBERG: We can get into that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. Well, yeah, I have some experience with VR. My Lab has used VR. Jeremy Bailenson's Lab at Stanford is one of the pioneering labs of VR and mixed reality. I guess they used to call it augmented reality, but now mixed reality. I think what's so striking about the VR that you guys had me try today is how well it interfaces with the real room, let's call it, the physical room. MARK ZUCKERBERG: Physical. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I could still see people. I could see where the furniture was. So I wasn't going to bump into anything. I could see people's smiles. I could see my water on the table while I was doing this what felt like a real martial arts experience, except I wasn't getting hit. Well, I was getting hit virtually. But it's extremely engaging. And yet, on the good side of things, it really bypasses a lot of the early concerns that Bailenson Lab-- again, Jeremy's Lab-- was early to say that, oh, there's a limit to how much VR one can or should use each day, even for the adult brain because it can really disrupt your vestibular system, your sense of balance. All of that seems to have been dealt with in this new iteration of VR. I didn't come out of it feeling dizzy at all. I didn't feel like I was reentering the room in a way that was really jarring. Going into it is obviously, Whoa, this is a different world. But you can look to your left and say, oh, someone just came in the door. Hey, how's it going? Hold on, I'm playing this game, just as it was when I was a kid playing in Nintendo and someone would walk in. It's fully engrossing. But you'd be like, hold on. And you see they're there. So first of all, bravo, incredible. And then the next question is, what do we even call this experience? Because it is truly really mixed. It's a truly mixed reality experience. MARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah. I mean, mixed reality is the umbrella term that refers to the combined experience of virtual and augmented reality. So augmented reality is what you're eventually going to get with some future version of the smart glasses, where you're primarily seeing the world, but you can put holograms in it. So we'll have a future where you're going to walk into a room. And there are going to be as many holograms as physical objects. If you just think about all the paper, the art, physical games, media, your workstation-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: If we refer to, let's say, an MMA fight, we could just draw it up on the table right here and just see it repeat as opposed to us turning and looking at a screen. MARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah. I mean, pretty much any screen that exists could be a hologram in the future with smart glasses. There's nothing that actually physically needs to be there for that when you have glasses that can put a hologram there. And it's an interesting thought experiment to just go around and think about, OK, what of the things that are physical in the world need to actually be physical. Your chair does, right? Because you're sitting on it. A hologram isn't going to support you. But like that art on the wall, I mean, that doesn't need to physically be there. So I think that that's the augmented reality experience that we're moving towards. And then we've had these headsets that historically we think about as VR. And that has been something that is like a fully immersive experience. But now, we're getting something that's a hybrid in between the two and capable of both, which is a headset that can do both virtual reality and some of these augmented reality experiences. And I think that that's really powerful, both because you're going to get new applications that allow people to collaborate together. And maybe the two of us are here physically, but someone joins us and it's their avatar there. Or maybe it's some version in the future. You're having a team meeting. And you have some people there physically. And you have some people dialing in. And they're basically like a hologram, there virtually. But then you also have some AI personas that are on your team that are helping you do different things. And they can be embodied as avatars and around the table meeting with you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Are people are going to be doing first dates that are physically separated? I could imagine that some people would-- is it even worth leaving the house type date? And then they find out. And then they meet for the first time. MARK ZUCKERBERG: I mean, maybe. I think dating has physical aspects to it, too. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. Some people might not be-- they want to know whether or not it's worth the effort to head out or not. They want to bridge the divide, right? MARK ZUCKERBERG: It is possible. I mean, I know some of my friends who are dating basically say that in order to make sure that they have a safe experience, if they're going on a first date, they'll schedule something that's shorter and maybe in the middle of the day. So maybe it's coffee. So that way, if they don't like the person, they can just get out before going and scheduling a dinner or a real, full date. So I don't know. Maybe in the future, people will have that experience where you can feel like you're kind of sitting there. And it's and it's even easier, and lighter weight and safer. And if you're not having a good experience, you can just teleport out of there and be gone. But yeah, I think that this will be an interesting question in the future. There are clearly a lot of things that are only possible physically that-- or are so much better physically. And then there are all these things that we're building up that can be digital experiences. But it's this weird artifact of how this stuff has been developed that the digital world and the physical world exist in these completely different planes. When you want to interact with the digital world-- we do it all the time. But we pull out a small screen. Or we have a big screen. And just basically, we're interacting with the digital world through these screens. But I think if we fast forward a decade or more, I think one of the really interesting questions about what is the world that we're going to live in, I think it's going to increasingly be this mesh of the physical and digital worlds that will allow us to feel, A, that the world that we're in is just a lot richer because there can be all these things that people create that are just so much easier to do digitally than physically. But B, you're going to have a real physical sense of presence with these things and not feel like interacting in the digital world is taking you away from the physical world, which today is just so much viscerally richer and more powerful. I think the digital world will be embedded in that and will feel just as vivid in a lot of ways. So that's why I always think-- when you were saying before, you felt like you could look around and see the real room. I actually think there's an interesting kind of philosophical distinction between the real room and the physical room, which historically I think people would have said those are the same thing. But I actually think, in the future, the real room is going to be the combination of the physical world with all the digital artifacts and objects that are in there that you can interact with them and feel present, whereas the physical world is just the part that's physically there. And I think it's possible to build a real world that's the sum of these two that will actually be more profound experience than what we have today. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I was struck by the smoothness of the interface between the VR"}

microbiome and this is a direct outgrowth of our discussion about nutrition here's the simple takeaway that I believe everyone should follow not just for sake of healthy appearing skin but also for sake of every organ and tissue system in your body which is the data clearly show that ingestion of sufficient amounts of fiber so Prebiotic and probiotic fiber so fruits vegetables sometimes this can also come from grains some people will supplement with additional fiber if they feel they need it as well as ingestion of low sugar fermented foods talked about this before so regular listeners of this podcast may have heard this things like kimchi sauerkraut the sort of sauerkraut that has to stay in the fridge so not the stuff that's stable on the Shelf at room temperature anything containing a brine that salty brine so pickles but not the pickles that are stable at room temperature the ones that have to be kept in the refrigerated section of the grocery store these low sugar fermented foods are powerful enhancers of the gut microbiome and when the gut microbiome is healthy you have reduced overall inflammation in the body this is often reflected at the level of the skin and basically skin health and the youthfulness appearance of skin is enhanced okay this can also help with conditions like acne or psoriasis especially in conditions where there's a direct immune system skin relationship that we'll talk about more in a little bit okay so I highly recommend people have anywhere from 1 to four servings of low sugar fermented foods per day or try and enhance the health of their gut microb biome generally maybe you take a pill probiotic although those can be very expensive there's a little bit of data suggesting that if you chronically take pill probiotics that yield very high levels of bacteria well then maybe there's some Associated brain fog that's a little unclear pun intended but you know they are very expensive they have to be kept refrigerated and let's face it low sugar fermented foods if you find the ones that you like are really great to ingest cuz they're tasty and they're good for you now why am I talking about this in part because we keep coming back to inflammation as a general issue for skin health and that points us also towards some specific dos and don'ts as it relates to Lifestyle let's face it pun intended if you sleep well so maybe you need six hours maybe you need seven maybe you need eight maybe you need nine but if you sleep well on a consistent basis your skin is going to look so much better so much healthier more vibrant than if you are not getting enough sleep if you drink alcohol and you wake up the next morning you know your Skin's going to look puffy it's not going to look good but many of you can ingest alcohol without issues I've an entire episode about alcohol yes it's a poison up to two drinks per week for adults who are non-alcoholics is probably safe zero is better than any but let's face it alcohol is going to exacerbate most skin issues this is just clear from the literature doesn't mean you never have a glass of wine doesn't mean you never have a beer or a cocktail if that's your thing but alcohol consumed in excess and it doesn't take much to get there is going to cause sleep issues microbiome issues so indirectly and negatively impact the skin appearance and health and indirectly and negatively impact the health of other tissues in your body but it's clear some of that is reduced to increase inflammation some is related to decreased Sleep Quality or duration so get great sleep avoid alcohol in excess maybe avoid it allog together drink plenty of water this sounds like such basic advice but proper hydration is key get enough water in electrolytes it absolutely will impact your inflammation Levels by reducing them it absolutely will impact your skin health and appearance in a positive way so these are just basic things that I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the other one is smoking and nicotine from non-smoked sources so it's very clear that smoking vaping dipping or snuffing is bad for skin appearance and health bad bad bad every dermatologist said this why well with smoking you can imagine why okay a lot of carcinog and toxic end products generated from smoking even from vaping yes even from vaping it will make your skin age faster that's clear but it's also the substance itself why all of those things in addition to increasing inflammation nicotine itself is a vasoconstrictor so you're doing the exact opposite of what you want when it comes to skin health and appearance and that's why people take things like bpc 157 that's why people take nicotinamide that's why people are trying to improve the hydration status of their skin so if you're somebody that's vaping nicotine or even taking nicotine in some other form pouch or smoking nicotine and you're interested in having youthful appearing skin you are really shooting yourself in the I know face and as we all know our emotions impact the appearance of our skin and yes it can exacerbate so-called breakouts and we'll get to that in a moment as to what the exact pathway is but I've done entire episodes about controlling your stress we have a master stress episode that talks about real time tools that you can use like the physiological sigh provide a link to a clip about the physiological sigh it's the fastest way that I'm aware of to reduce one's levels of stress this is something my laboratory has studied in detail at Stanford there are also things you can do and we're all aware of what they are proper sleep meditation non-sleep deep rest we'll provide a link for that all things that we can do that are zero cost very minimal time investment physiological side takes about 10 to 15 seconds uh non-sleep deep breast AK Yoga Nidra sometimes called takes anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes per day and that reduced stress can dramatically improve not just the health but the appearance of your skin and it makes perfect sense as to why that is the stress hormones such as cortisol but other hormones too such as adrenaline when they are chronically elevated because of the fact that adrenaline impacts Vaso constriction in the skin it's going to reduce blood flow to the periphery to the skin it can cause all sorts of issues at the level of nerve endings that can lead to believe it or not enhanced Flushing when we're under stress this is why we measure the galvanic skin response so not just sweating but also blood flow and other things to the skin when we are studying stress okay so direct relationship between stress and skin appearance learn to control your stress stress is part of life but learn to control your stress in real time and through tools like non-sleep deep rest that are zero cost that can help you reduce your overall levels of stress get great sleep don't use nicotine if you do use nicotine know what you're doing maybe use it sparingly and please don't smoke or vape it dip it or snuff it there are other form forms and I don't recommend those forms because they're very very addictive and keep in mind that things that improve blood flow reduce inflammation give you lower stress better sleep all of that is"}

they be enhancing work creativity focused work I mean I think you and I both um clearly agree that there's not just great value in terms of productivity yeah but a great degree of of Life Enrichment yeah like a deep level of enrichment in terms of Happiness feelings of well-being con time for connectivity with others lessons about deep work that can be exported to time with others where we are really present Etc just so much be gained from these from engaging in deep work and things like it that you've written about in your various books um and talk about on your podcast are you know is there a top three yeah yeah yeah so if I do three I would say Okay um first of all with your workload simulate something like a pull system instead of a push system and what I mean by that is when you keep track of what you're working on have the the top part of that list which is I'm actively working on these things and keep that top part of your list to like two or three things everything else is in the bottom part of the list it's to work on next and it's in an ordered queue and so when you finish something that you're working on you pull something new to take a slot from the list below right so what I'm trying to do with that advice is reduce all this administrative overhead because now even if like you can't get away you have to say yes to these things because it's the way like your your organization works the stuff that's in the waiting to work on Q you said I don't have meetings about that I don't do emails about that I wait till I'm actively working on it and I only actively work on three things at a time now I'm going to finish those things really quickly because I don't have 15 items worth of meetings I'm going to every day so things are going to pull up there pretty quickly and so the rate at which I'm accomplishing things will probably be higher than it was before but I only work on three things actively you could even make this visible it's in a shared document if you want to when someone asks you to do something new tell them to put it on the end of your Cube they like oh okay so like Andrew is not working on this right now he's working on these three things and there's seven things here and I'm adding something number eight so I know not to expect something for a while um in fact I can keep checking this list until I see Andrew is working on it so I can see it's making progress and then once I know he's working on it I can start email him about it and we can do just a normal type of overhead you would have with with projects right uh that alone is going to have a huge difference like now the amount of distraction your day is going to uh plumm it because that's generated from overhead of things you've agreed to do and that's going to that's going to plummet that down all right so that'd be number one could I just thank you could I just ask a few questions about that just to clarify so for I use myself as an example selfishly but then of course I don't know what everyone else out there is pursuing but so substitute the specifics I'm about to insert here for whatever it is that you care about in your life so um researching podcasts yeah SOLO podcasts in particular for me is my major task in life these days yeah uh with respect to work so that would be top of the list yeah um and then um there could be two other items on this you know top of queue um would daily activities like like exercise Social time with loved ones Etc would that be included there or we're talking specifically about work yeah let's just keep just work okay so it would be you know podcast prep you might podcast prepcast you might have the particular topic though right right okay so right I'm working on an episode right now about about skin Health yeah um you could you could have two different episode topics you're prepping those could both be up there yep so skin Health allergies episode These are that I'm spending a lot of time on um months in fact yeah right and then your third might be something that that involves the uh the media company something around the business side like okay we're trying to figure out um a plan for whatever right content for forand Association or something okay got it great so that those three would be top of the list and every day until those are done they could sit top of the list and then there are a number of items underneath those that fall under whatever yeah and and critically when these other items come up right like oh this is like a topic for example I want to do a show on you have a place to put it where it's not being forgotten or here's a here's a business idea like we need to figure out like whatever we want to add do something with our camera configure okay put on the list so it's not being forgotten like it it's on there and you can see where it is not only is it on there but like this could be shared among your team so as people had extra information or things to add to one of these projects they can add it to it on the list right so the information is aggregating so if you use a tool like Trello for this Trello spelled t r l l o okay is it an app it's a webbased service that the metaphor is just index cards in piles it right but they're virtual um but you can flip over the index card digitally attach files write notes and and so I use Trello for my own organization what I'm working on so now you have a place where you can gather like oh we just I just heard about something that's relevant to this thing I need to work on you have a place to put it like it goes onto the Trello card or you could do this with shared documents doesn't matter you're just like literally typing things into a Google doc you know or a whiteboard or a whiteboard yeah yeah you could be we're keeping track of these things right I'm going to do this by the way yeah well I mean I'm a big believer in this and then everyone can see what you're working on um and then uh but the key thing is if it's not in your active list you don't have meetings about it and you don't have emails about it right like if people have ideas or things they just add it to the card so when that gets up to the active list we can work on all the information there we haven't forgotten anything and what two-word uh language do you use to describe this first point this method I love this I called it a pull based pull based right what pulled up you pull into the so you're fixing in advance here's how much concentration I have to give on work and you pull stuff into that the alternative is push based which is how most organizations run which is when I want you to do something I just push it onto you and now you have to deal with it got it um I once heard email described as a public post to-do list yeah that made me scared of email in a way that nothing else had um it's newport's pull-based system I called it that by the way um this is what in the a lot of the advice in the first uh one of the chapters of the new book is basically how do you get away with implementing this and when you have a boss and there's like all sorts of different so you're Your Own Boss you can just say this is what we're doing here's the board but there's a lot of like subtle ways you can do yeah um right so that's number one that's number one the um Cal newport's pull-based system I'm going to do this and I'm actually going to report back on this at some point um you won't see the post on social media because you're not there but others will all right so that's one all right number two would be

that are possible and yet they're on the verge of impossible so uh a former rendition of it was uh when I memorized the entire audience I know everybody by name and it's just a skill I memorized 120 people every night so do you use a pneumonic approach where you you know like Andrew sounds like or reminds you of some other things so are you doing a pair pair Association sure so I tell you a story about it there's a there was he just died at 907 something like that old man but he he was sharp to to his last day Harry Lorraine was a memory guy he performed as a magician but also uh taught people how to remember things wrote a lot of books um so I and he was known for that he was on the Carson Show he memorized the entire audience and it was really cool it was a thing signature piece of his and I wanted to do it in my show so we called him and said can we get permission to use that piece and he says sure so can we meet with you and you teach me you know those little details the minutia and and I I came with a notebook and a pen I'm ready to take notes how do you remember 120 people every night 120 people's names so I'm say okay so what's the work on it and he goes you just remember them you're saying first and last names or first names first and last first and last names you can do first he did first and last yeah goodness gracious so he says just remember them yeah but tell me the techniques and I thought it was a joke I wrote nothing that day nothing and I was so scared of it and and I I tried to remember people and I couldn't and it was so daunting and I realized that in order to remember a lot of people's names the first thing you need to conquer is fear it's feir I was afraid I that I won't be able to do it and and one night I did a small venue with like 30 people showed up I said okay that's manageable I can memorize 30 people so I did it and you you don't know that you know their names until you do it because all I do is I say shake their hands oh thank you so much please take your seat I was the Asher sit down thank you now the show starts and this is a test for me do I remember their names I don't know and I go Susan B blah blah blah BL and I and I was able to do all their names do you still remember any of their names I tell you a story about that to remind me though I will I'll come back to that um so it felt like I had superpowers it was amazing to me I think as it was maybe to them and then some some then I started doing it in that venue with about 60 people so I remember I I have everybody sit down and there's a point in the show where I take two coins large coins and I glue them with tape on my head so I I'm blindfolded and I sold two Rubik's Cubes at the same time blindfold it and I forgot talking about memory I forgot to have somebody uh you just have a stopwatch just to to time me how long it takes me to do it I just forgot and I go guys I'm so sorry I forgot is does anybody here has a watch or or an app that he can measure take time and one guy goes yeah I can do it and I recognize his voice and I and I did not know I could do it I go Robert and he goes yes so I did not just remember how they look I remember how they sound and you didn't know that you remembered how they sound it was just part of your it was a surprise to meh and then to make and it's crazy you s you're sitting next to Susan right and Stephanie and I describe how they look like almost to a tea and it amazes me how much we do remember and that's crazy because the voice like your voice my voice people's voice are very distinct we and I now I know it that I can hear somebody peripheral you know and I I know um so that's that's about memory how do we we get how do we get to this memory so um to to your question you ask me if if if use the pneumonics or stuff the truth is we need to care if you care about someone's name like let's assume you see somebody in a coffee shop and do the one thing you really wanted is to talk to this person because I don't know you're attracted to them I don't know and you say hi nice to meet you I'm aie what's your name the moment they say they're name you will never forget it because you care you want a lot of times we say hey what's your name we don't mean it we don't care about the answer and that's a big part of why we don't remember it but if I say you you know you need to meet this guy this guy you should know him uh you will make an effort so the one thing I did the most was repeat their their name what's her name Andrew oh Andrew nice to meet you I repeat it a few times as I talk to them or we have a little conversation and I also realize that the more you interact with them the more you remember it so in the show I always I faked it I struggled on the last two people I said I I don't know your name remain standing I'll get back to you and it was geniv I remember the story geniv say you know I don't know her name yet so I said I don't remember your name but you told me you just came from Africa you were on vacation for two weeks and I start recalling so much information about her and it Genevie I'll never forget your name and she sits down and it's amazing but the more they tell you about themselves the more you retain and the more you remember because as you said it's a story and now there geniv is just not it's not just a random person with a name geniv it's somebody who's been to that place and this place and she's you know you can connect it to a story or to something you can visualize right every now and then you know stove is Stave and you know I would make those pneumonics uh um or try to find a feature almost like the way a caricaturist does you know exaggerate a feature and attach it to the name somehow like antthony maybe has lots of ants all over him you know stuff like that but the truth is I only did it with those I struggled it was a backup plan I but most of the people I hear the name I cared I wanted and I had confidence that I could do it and I did it the brain definitely remembers information that has an emotional sance to it it so caring about something some set of information name or otherwise definitely will um help encode to memory the other is to put things into motifs of song it is no coincidence that children learn songs to learn the alphabet A B C D the inflections the motifs within that song of the alphabet is what allows us to remember that our entire lives as opposed to a b CDE e f g think about the number Pi out past 3 14 out to some number of of um you know you know some people can remember it out very far if you set it to a song with some repeating motifs like the alphabet song or Happy Birthday song you can that's how people remember very very far because the brain creates these modules it doesn't um take bits of information and just throw it in there it it creates libraries of information where just as in the library certain books are grouped with other books and more disparate tops ICS are positioned further away in the library uh from one another um for those of you that are younger than than me you can look up what a library is just kidding um but this is how the brain works right and so it's amazing that you did that and and it also just um really highlights um that when we do this we are remembering far more than we think we remember um some people are more visual some people more auditory but it's all coming in there provided that people have access to those senses um it's just spectacular I have to return to something because I took us away from it which was you said is there something about walking that allows for Creative um thought um I'm of the mind now based on my observation of extremely creative individuals and um talking to them as well as some understanding of the Neuroscience of creativity which by the way there isn't a lot but it's sort of happening more and more um that there are sort of two polarized States um one is being very very still with the Mind active this is true of rapid eye movement sleep we're paralyzed the mind is very very active it's a state in which memories are encoded especially me uh emotional memories um many people his name seems to keep coming up but Rick Rubin Carl daero Einstein and others reported having practices where they would deliberately sit or lie down and to be very still and deliberately make their mind very active even thinking in complete sentences as a way to come up with ideas a deliberate practice the other is to be in movement but to not really try and force your thinking down a particular trajectory some people seem to favor one or the other I come up with a lot of my ideas while jogging or running or walking as as you do so there's something about either stealing the body or making the body just active enough that the mind is allowed to take off down novel trajectories um and that's very difficult I think for a lot of people just sit down with pen and paper and write things out so anyway um your practice of walking in the morning is one that perhaps people should uh want to explore I think that um when people hear about having a super memory for"}
{"question": "Can you think of any simple and easy-to-implement techniques that can be used to enhance memory formation, particularly for information that you're not particularly excited about or find repetitive, and how do you think incorporating these techniques into your daily routine can have a positive impact on your brain performance?", "doc_id": "099hgtRoUZw_6", "video_id": "099hgtRoUZw", "video_title": "Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Boost Attention & Memory with Science-Based Tools | Huberman Lab Podcast #73", "video_header": "Tool: Foundational Habits to Enhance Brain Performance", "segment_idx": "6", "time_start": "21:56", "time_end": "30:36", "context": "- It seems like a location. We talk about conditioned place aversion, which is just a geek speak for wanting to avoid the place where something bad happened, or conditioned place preference, wanting to go back to a place where something positive happened. Or even looking at a photograph of where you had a wonderful time with somebody and that can evoke all sorts of positive sensations. It seems like at some level, as complex as the brain is, the basic elements of feeling good or feeling lousy are states within the brain and body and linking those to places seems like it's a pretty straightforward formula, you know, link place to state, link state to place, etc., as your description just provided. When we learn more complex information, a poem, a concept, or we have to ratchet through a set of ideas, that also involves memory. I'm sure that we'll talk more about this, but is there any way that you are aware of that state, bodily state can be leveraged to enhance the speed or the quality of memories and memory formation? So to be clear about it, it seems there's something very important about this fourth, this emotional resonance component. Novelty, the crowbar into the doors, thank goodness sounds like it was novel, it wasn't repeated thing, thank goodness. So repetition is out and the association is very, very strong. But for people trying to learn information that they're not that excited about, or that repetition is hard, or the novelty is simply that it's painful. - Yes, I've been there, absolutely. - Yeah, as have I. Is there something that we can do to leverage knowledge of how the memory system works naturally to make that a more straightforward process? - So, I immediately turn to the things that I've studied that you talk about so beautifully on your podcast, which are strategies generally to make your brain work better. I was just reminding myself of your podcast about cold because I use that every morning. - Oh, you do cold? - I do, I do. - Just take a moment and, and just tell us, what is your cold exposure protocol, then I'll take you back to what you're saying. - So my cold exposure protocol is at the end of every morning shower that I take, the shower is warm, but I give myself a big blast of cold at the end of that and it makes me feel so good. And because I've been doing it for several years, it's so much less painful. Okay, I admit, it was really painful at the beginning, but it's much less painful. I could handle the cold water and my pipes give nice, really cold water. And it just, I could feel the awakedness kind of come up in me after that. And I miss it, if I forget to do it, sometimes I run back in and give myself that cold blast because it is upping, I think you talked about this on your podcast, what's happening in the brain? - Basically the cold stimulus, that shock, that catching your breath, etc., is adrenaline from the adrenals. But also from what we understand now, some new neuroimaging, there's epinephrine and norepinephrine released from locus ceruleus, which again is a brain structure in the back of the brain, kind of sprinklers the rest of the brain with a kind of a wake-up chemical. And there's a long arc on dopamine release. This paper back in 2000 showed that it's a steady increase up to about 2.5x of circulating dopamine. So they weren't looking directly in the brain admittedly, but it goes on for four or five hours. - Wow, yeah. - So the improved mood and the feeling of alertness is a real thing. - Yeah, yeah, so I use that. I mean, so basically I use my morning routine. What is my morning routine? I get up, I do a 45-minute tea meditation. So meditating over the brewing and drinking of tea that I learned from a monk who has an institute in Taiwan where he teaches tea meditation, love it. I've learned all about tea, different kinds of tea. And then I do a 30-minute cardio weights workout. Then I take my shower with the hot-cold contrast. And, oh, and before that, key thing, if I want to learn something and I want to be able to get over the difficulty of repeating things, or just push myself to do stuff, sleep, so good, good sleep. I've learned that over the pandemic, I did sleep experiments on myself and I learned that I was sleeping an hour less than I really needed. So I really need seven-and-a-half to eight hours of sleep. And I was getting six and a half. And so now, I get that seven-and-a-half to eight hours every single night, and guess what? I come to different difficult tasks and I am more willing to give it a try, to try longer, to try harder, and my brain works better. And so I think probably if you go back to all of your podcasts, you'll learn exactly why each one of those things that I do, which I would bet that you probably do, too, is helping my brain. - I guarantee they are. And I'm impressed that you do all these things, although not surprised. And I should say that the extra hour of sleep is really impressive and extremely beneficial. I'm curious, do you get that in the early part of the night by going to bed earlier? - Yeah. - Terrific, and I should just mention, 'cause you're too humble to do it, but I'll say it again that not only are you a full professor, tenured full professor and running a laboratory, you teach undergraduates, you have an important role in public education, multiple books, and you're now dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at NYU. So the extra hour of sleep is benefiting you and as a consequence benefiting everybody else as well. Thanks for sharing with us your protocol. I took you off the trajectory of what one can do, but I think that people and I appreciate knowing kind of what the practical steps are. Because knowing the science is important, mechanism I do believe is important for embedding protocols in people's minds and why they might want to do them, but really hearing the mechanics of it is useful. It sounds like everything together takes about an hour, it's not an excessive amount of time, but it probably gives you an outsized positive effect on your day. - Absolutely, I definitely notice it if I'm not able to do it. And when I don't, so I do this seven days a week, it's also not just five days, seven days a week. And when I can't do it, it's usually early-morning flights or things like that. And I get over it, but it's critical for the working of my brain. - I love it and I'll just highlight one thing that you said before we move on, which is that you said when sometimes if you get out of the shower before the cold, you'll get back in. That's, to me, a really beautiful example of conditioned place preference. Now the cold shower has become something that you sort of look forward to. I should say that nobody is immune from the adrenaline increase of cold, no matter how cold, this is what's interesting about cold. It's one of the reasons why it's such an important part of the screening for special operations, so our SEAL teams, but other branches in military too, which is that there are very few stimuli that you can give anyone and consistently get an adrenaline - Oh, interesting. - Release from that without harming them. With heat, eventually you need to use so much heat that you damage tissue. Or with exercise, you have to use so much exercise that you can damage joints. And it's this very kind of brilliant, I don't know if it was intentional or not, it's sort of unintentional genius that special operations has figured out that by sending people back into the cold over and over, it never really gets easier, but over time people actually start to crave it and it provides this reduction in inflammation, etc. So anyway, beautiful practice, thank you. I want to learn more about your tea meditation later in the episode. But in any event returning to ways that we can improve memory formation. Maybe if you would tell us your story around this."}

And we will arrive at the psychology soon, but I really want you to understand the difference between the three kinds of stress on three different timescales, short-term, medium-term, and long-term, and what it's good for and what it's bad for. I think we've all heard that stress is bad for us. We've seen these pictures intended to frighten us. And indeed they are frightening. You see the nice really plump brain on the left. It says healthy or control. And then you see the brain that says stressed above it on the right and it's like withered, where we see that the hippocampus and area involved in memory is smaller. People that are stressed. We see that the Alzheimer's brain is made worse by stress. That people who have a predisposition to schizophrenia, when they get stressed, higher incidence of schizophrenia episodes. You hear that addicts will relapse when they're stressed. I mean, okay, we get it. And it's very important, but I think we've all heard now so many times that stress is bad. But in that conversation, unfortunately, it's eclipsed some of the really positive things that stress does for us in the short-term. So, stress can be short-term, medium-term, or long-term."}

your parents which I I never understood why they don't put call your parents on the green but anyway right so you know you start on the green and then you get you get down to the yellow and they get around to red and you know there's Ted's little friend is always getting on the red by 9 A.M it's like can we just get it over with you know and and he tried to talk with his teacher about why this behavior chart made him so uncomfortable because and she couldn't she could not understand his perspective because she kept saying but you're always on green you're always doing what you're supposed to be doing and you're respectful and you're well behaved so why is it a problem and what he was trying to say was that somehow it just made him uncomfortable to have that there so he was constantly bothering me with this I finally told him I was trying to work one day and he was home from school because I would let him work from home some days because we needed to to kind of buffer a little bit and uh you know he'd bring all his work home and he'd do it himself I'd be working he'd be working right it's fine he had all kinds of projects going on you know and this is a kid who does a little Side Story there's a kid who went to first grade and about two weeks into first grade good first grade class he he was crying on a Sunday night to me like I can't go to school I don't want to go to school I'm like well what's you know what's wrong I'm thinking he's getting bullets and he's talking he's like I don't know he finally looks at me and he goes I have so much work to do how do you expect me to get my work done if I'm sitting in school all day I can relate right I can relate can you relate because you're actually a motivated right we take kids motivations and the things they're interested in and we sideline them and try to structure them into something so back there are Legos yeah oh he was he was way into building armor at that time he would yeah I know we're probably terrible parents but we gave him some safety glasses and we taught him how to use it and we explained how Metals sharp and we gave him some shoes that is super cool and some tin snips and he made a whole set of armor in the backyard at you know in second grade anyway it took him months and months I mean it chained mail the whole bit he was super into amazing you know anyway and he made airplane he did all kinds of things um but so here's this kid and he's bugging me about his teacher in this paper Trend I said Ted go write a letter to your teacher if it bothers you that much you go write a letter about why it bothers you right because in doing so he's first of all helping to solve the problem secondly he was he was formulating his understanding of what this behavior chart is and why specifically it bothers him and in so doing it helps him not be so bothered by it right so that's an example of something you could do right so he wrote this letter to his teacher which ended up being published in the National Academy of Science engineering and Matt's book how people learn volume two because I was on the committee of people that wrote it and we needed an example of kids making sense out of motivational things and actually took his name and the teacher's name off and put the letter in the book it basically is a little kid saying listen teacher when you put up this behavior chart he called it a bad behavior chart which it wasn't it was just a behavior chart but he interprets it as bad behavior when you put that up it's as if your you're daring me to do something bad you're you're basically he doesn't say it like this he says you're basically making me uncomfortable because you are laying out a perspective on me a possibility space for me that you're now bringing into the conversation that I could be like that and let's see if you're going to be oh not today oh we're still on green right and so where does this go it goes back to the idea that kids are and all of us are interpreting the interactions and the structures around us not only for what they are but for what they represent as somebody else's interpretation of what we are or are not capable of and he saw that behavior chart as a marker that his teacher assumed that all kids in that class are capable of being badly behaved and that their main aim of being in school is to be well behaved right and so he writes all about saying saying dear teacher every day I come to school every single day and every single day is new that's what he says and I could learn something new except then I see dot dot dot the bad behavior chart right he's saying school is supposed to be about learning and and US engaging and you're making it about something so low level and basic as are you going to behave yourself today we're we are insulting him by the way we frame the context so take it back to the bigger issues of Civic discourse and all these things I think so much of the way that we're organizing our lives our social relationships our community our Civic structures right now is mirroring that teacher's behavior chart right she take the chart down I don't no I don't think so and and what and I asked because I'm not sure that it matters I think what probably matters is that he had the chance to voice he voices his understanding yeah his understanding of the chart yeah that's right and now you know anybody can read his understanding of the story because in like uh you know the most you widely read textbook on learning right um and motivation I mean first is that we're structuring the way we structure our environment can unwittingly impose our mental models of other people's possibility spaces onto them and people find that inherently abhorrent right so think about how we're doing that in many contexts not simply in schools um and then the second thing is from the kids perspective deconstructing exactly why and something bothers you by understanding how it is that you are interpreting that thing then opens you up to be able to manage those spaces in a new way and to engage in them in a new way so if we take the conversation back to the idea of Civic discourse of Civic reasoning of engaging with with any idea right there are ideas that are deeply problematic there are ideas that are deeply hurtful that have long histories of trauma associated with them of long histories of power dynamics uh and oppression associated with them the way in which I think we deconstruct those ideas is going to be critical to how those ideas live on implicitly in our social relationships and our society if we cancel them if we negate them and pretend they don't exist all we're doing is burying them in a place where they can't be deconstructed and only by actually taking them apart and appreciating the pain the the relationship structures the limitation the resource allocations the inequities that are implicit in those Concepts only by deconstructing and deeply understanding those can we rebuild them in a different way so it's very difficult because on the one hand we have a space created for ourselves right now in society that is deeply unsafe for many people and when you're in an unsafe space you are not in a space that is conducive to constructing and deconstructing meaning using those default mode systems and other systems just to be crass about the brain right and kind of oversimplify it that are the substrate of autobiographical self of possibility spaces of ethics of deep uh moral and ethical emotions so on the one hand we have a space that is deeply unsafe for individuals to think together and genuinely so there are real implications for people to reveal certain kinds of identities to engage with certain kinds of ideas in culturally uh culturally um formulated spaces right that we've constructed together and the irony is that we can only fix that and create a different way of interacting with one another by actually boldly going in there together so it's a very nuanced line where we need to develop skills and this is where I think and many people think now that schools should be focused across disciplinary domains whether it's Math Science Social Studies history art the Arts right Sports should be focused on helping young people and teachers develop capacities and dispositions for deconstructing and constructing again safe uh safe cultural spaces to think together about you know interpretations about narratives about stories about assumptions about ideas because as we engage in those thoughts together we call that Civic discourse right we learn kind of rules for not triggering and sensibilities for not endangering another person's ability to engage on equal footing with us because if we trigger those unsafe right dangerous places for people they can't neurobiologically then engage with us deeply around sharing their perspective and deconstructing hours together to build something where we have a shared understanding in the middle we have to trust one another and Trust trusting one another really means we have to have a space established in which we can feel safe to deconstruct our own beliefs and to allow others to do the same and to assure them that we can engage with those beliefs no matter what they are and then actually exteriorize them and evaluate them together and think about them around core values we probably both hold like well-being like sustainability of society and of cultures and of groups right these things are core everyone wants to be well everyone wants to have a sustainable life and a Life future and a cultural set of values and so when we all appreciate that we're bringing those things to the table but then are systematic about constructing a space for civic discourse in which we are supporting one another and deconstructing our own beliefs rather than each other's bullies right then we are at a space where we can start to construct some kind of understanding some kind of nuanced more um uh adaptive more pro-social and the true sense way of engaging with one another with not necessarily a way of agreeing with one another but way of engaging and constructing and deconstructing meaning together so that we can be adaptive so that we can build a society where everyone can flourish so that we can build a society where everyone can belong and can uh can actually have the resources they need I would argue as long as free speech is not possible for everybody yeah that nobody yes that's right then nobody is safe nobody's safe and that there's an illusion of safety around the idea that um people who um who have voice uh are going to get what they want simply because they are the ones who are allowed to talk and other people aren't yeah I mean I think he said it perfectly when he said that anytime ideas get buried there's no way they can be solved yeah we know this from the scientific literature for instance the results within social science and biological science that are deeply troubling yeah um you know I can think of experiments that were done uh in the realm of neurosurgery on humans in the 1960s people stimulating different brain areas and seeing Rage or seeing very politically controversial ideas emerge from the person's mouth in real time as a function of stimulating that brain area and then you say well did they really believe that and they just never were saying it and the person doesn't even recall that happening during the surgery or I mean this idea that Jung had that we have all things inside of us yeah I think can be seen as a very dangerous notion and territory that we have all these Shadows but the the I'm also an optimist and I feel that the the optimistic view of it is that by knowing that we have all things inside of us potentially and by embracing that fact that we can manage that to steal what you just said we can manage that and that we can function so much better when we see something in the world that we think that's not me I'm not that and I hate that when if we understand that that also lives inside of us but that we just don't realize it uh and I realize some people hear this and they'll go that's not true you know I have my stances and I disagree with other things I would say absolutely yes but the difference between one person's stance and another person's stance is could be purely developmental wiring it could be um it could be a difference of having read different childhood books and oriented towards one book versus another I mean I don't I think that we are very similar at the level of core wiring and core algorithms that we run but somehow these days we have the perception that we've diverged so much I think the only thing that's really missing is what you're describing is is a place where any and all ideas can be explored freely not to establish consensus or validity of certain kinds of ideas but to actually exteriorize them and and deconstruct them for what they actually are absolutely um thank you for working through that that space because it's a tricky one it's very it's very fresh yeah it's very fraught um but so so

But most people do not get enough of so-called EPA form of omega 3s. And for that reason, I and many other people choose to supplement with a minimum of 1 gram per day and in some cases as high as 2 grams per day of omega 3s in supplement form. So typically one would get to 1 to 2 grams of EPA by supplementing their nutrition, their diet, that is, with fish oil capsules or liquid fish oil. There are many different sources of these. That was discussed in an episode that I did with Dr. Rhonda Patrick. I find that it's most cost efficient to get that 1 to 2 grams of EPAs from liquid fish oil despite what you might see on the internet. I don't have any relationship whatsoever to a liquid fish oil company. You just want to make sure that you go with a reputable brand. I like the ones that are flavored with lemon so that it offsets the taste of fish oil, and I'll take a tablespoon or two of that per day. And if I'm traveling and even if I'm not I will often use fish oil capsules, and there are a variety of different sources of those as well. Getting sufficient amounts of omega 3 has been shown to be important for mood. So as a way to offset depression but also for enhancing overall mood that probably relates to the omega 3s effect on neurotransmission, not just for neuromodulators like serotonin and dopamine but for all neurotransmission. And neurotransmission, of course, is essential for neuromuscular performance. And the omega 3s have been implicated in reducing the inflammation response, cardiovascular health, et cetera. I realized that there is some debate about omega 3s, but when I look at the bulk of literature about the omega 3s, it's very clear to me that getting 1 to 2 grams of EPA form of omega 3 per day is the right thing for me to do. And many others find that as well. The second tool to enhance your fitness"}
{"question": "Can viewing bright light in the evening or at other non-circadian times affect my mood and learning abilities, even if I'm getting enough sleep and maintaining a regular sleep-wake cycle?", "doc_id": "oUu3f0ETMJQ_13", "video_id": "oUu3f0ETMJQ", "video_title": "Dr. Samer Hattar: Timing Light, Food, & Exercise for Better Sleep, Energy & Mood", "video_header": "Dangers of Bright Light Between 10 pm and 4 am: Mood & Learning", "segment_idx": "13", "time_start": "56:07", "time_end": "1:01:02", "context": "Let's talk about the relationship between light and some of these other non-circadian or pseudo-circadian effects. And we will try and link those. But you had a what I consider absolutely landmark beautiful paper published in \"Nature\" a few years ago, showing that if you disrupt the exposure to light or the timing of the exposure to light that there are dramatic effects on the stress system and on the learning and memory system. Maybe we could talk about each of those separately or together. What are the effects on stress and the effects on learning when light viewing behavior and sleep-wake cycles are disrupted? - Yeah, so just to remind you, you know that, but to remind your listeners that I was trained as a circadian biologist. So I really was indoctrinated into thinking that light has to affect the clock, which then caused all these different effects. So, that's what I believe. That's my dogma. That's what have made me really happy. And then Tara LeGates and Cara Altimus joined the lab and we started discussing a lot of data. And we said, what if there is a direct effect of light that we're missing, independent of the circadian clock? So this is not an easy question to us to answer, because as we've been talking all along, light affects the circadian clock. So how could you give light at different times of the day and not mess up the circadian clock? Luckily, we came up with such a way, and that's why it was important to do these experiments the way we did them. And we proved that this light-dark cycle does not disrupt the clock, there is still a circadian rhythm, and does not cause sleep deprivation. And yet, surprisingly, if you give light at the wrong time of the day, even without disrupting the circadian clock or without causing sleep deprivation, as you mentioned you get the huge mood changes in the organisms and you get learning deficit. So, this really, and at the time people have really hit us hard. I mean, it was really hard to publish this work and you could, yeah. - Well, it came out in \"Nature.\" - Yeah. - So in the end you prevailed, but I want to make sure that I understand. So, you're saying that yes, there are effects of light on the circadian rhythm. - Absolutely. - Sleep meaning sleep and wakefulness. - Yes. - And their timing. However, there are direct effects of light on mood that can be dissociated from the effects on sleep and waking. - Absolutely. - So if I interpret that correctly, that could mean that when we view light and how much light, could make us feel happier or less happy or even depressed, stressed, learning, et cetera. - Bingo. - Even if we're sleeping and waking up at the appropriate time? - Bingo. I mean, eventually because we're talking about the whole system, eventually when you start having the other problems, you also develop sleep problems, but you're absolutely right. And in fact, now, research from Diego Fernandez in the lab have found that now we know that they actually require different brain regions. So we don't only have a theory, we don't only have a light environment that showed they can be dissociated, we know that they use completely different brain regions. So, the SCN that I told you about earlier, the place where the central pacemaker is, the one that receives direct input from the retina through the ipRCGs to adjust your circadian clock is not the area that receives the light input for mood regulation. It's a completely different brain region. - What's the brain region called? - So the brain region, we called it the perihabenular nucleus. I'm not so sure how good or bad the name, but it doesn't matter, it's that PHb. And what's really amazing, this region also receives direct input from the ipRCGs, but projects to areas in the brain that are known to regulate mood, including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which has been studied for many years to be impacted in the human depression. So just by this amazing serendipity to find that a region that is so deep in the advanced brain, like the prefrontal cortex is your executive brain, one of the most elaborated in humans, to see that they receive inputs from these ancient photoreceptor was stunning to us, and told us how much we didn't understand the importance of light on a human behavior. - So, how does that finding inform daily protocols for you or for other people? I realize you can't leap always from one paper- - Absolutely, yes. - To daily protocol. But if light indeed does control prefrontal cortex, executive function, learning, stress and mood, and let's say I'm waking up each morning and I'm sleeping. What should I do different? - That's why we came up with the tripartite model"}

The thing to know, and what I always tell myself is when I'm very alert, I am very prone to go, to action, but I'm also prone to, not no-go, right? I'm not gonna be very good at suppressing action. So those are two different things. Being biased toward action and being biased, toward suppressing action are two different things, okay? So those are push pull. Toward action, suppress action. So, when you're very alert, the tendency is for everything to be a stimulus. This is why when people say, well, should I just take a drug that will increase my level of epinephrine and alertness? Will that help me learn better? No, because it will make you do things, but it will also make you less good at suppressing actions that you need to suppress. So if I'm very alert, particularly alert for me and I recognize what that state is, of course 'cause everyone will be different. I know what it is for me. Then I want silence for learning. I want it shut down my internet, which I do. I sometimes use a program, that I believe is a free program called Freedom, where it actually locks you out of the internet for a particular time. They're not a sponsor of the podcast. I just happen to use it. There's another version of Freedom where you go to the wireless thing and you turn it off. You disconnect from the wireless. That's the other one. Although, many people have a hard time not reactivating it. So I'm trying to shut down the go pathway towards distraction. And the other thing that I'll do, is I'll generally turn off my phone, put the phone outside in the car or in really extreme cases I'll throw it up on the roof which is hard for me to retrieve, so that I can't get to it. So if I'm very alert, I'm aware that I will have a bias toward action. It will be hard for me to suppress non-action, but that it's very nonspecific.

Unrestorative Sleep?", "segment_idx": "17", "time_start": "1:32:35", "time_end": "1:44:04", "context": "about lucid dreaming which is a kind of mixed level of Consciousness dreaming of course but also Lucidity that is an awareness that one is dreaming now in just about every one of the five episodes leading up to this sixth episode in this series you emphasize the key importance of deep sleep and rapid eye movement sleep and in many ways some of the problems that arise from waking up in the middle of the night too many times or being in Shallow sleep as opposed to Deep Sleep lucid dreaming it seems is a kind of a case of light sleep because of one's awareness or is it so that's one the first question and then just very quickly an anecdote when I was a kid I used to read these like boy life magazines and those kind of things I for what they called but in the back they would have these um these ads for for products like x-ray glasses or you know or um or sea monkeys which turned out to be Brian shrimp what a disappointment that was um and um I thought they were monkeys on the on the package they were little monkeys but they were Brian shrimp um there was a product advertised that I in fact purchased which was an ey mask that had a little blinking red light in one corner and it said learn to lucid dream and the idea was that you would put this thing on and look at the red light just prior to going to sleep and then you go to sleep with this thing on and then at some point in your sleep you would see or think that you saw the red light flashing and the idea was that because you were in the ey mask you're in enough of a dream that you would be able to link the waking State recognition of the light Etc okay people get it I purchased that product I used it I thought perhaps there was an effect quote unquote where I could lucid dream but I wouldn't consider myself an avid Lucid dreamer although sometimes I am aware that I'm dreaming and usually it's in um pleasant dreams in which case I'm usually like yeah let's keep this going things like flying and and being you know particularly talented in a sport that in my Waking Life I had minimal Talent things like that okay so is lucid dreaming a case of shallow sleep and therefore something to avoid or is lucid dreaming something quite different and is there any advantage to learning to lucid dream or enhancing one's amount of lucid dreaming and if so how should one go about that so I'll take the question should you be lucid dreaming and I think I can argue it both sides right now and we don't have a very clear answer yet the first side is if you take a step back and ask from an evolutionary perspective let's assume for for want of a better worth that lucid streaming is helpful it's meaningful and that we should engage in it if that's the case that it confers some type of evolutionary benefit then you would expect that a lot of people would be doing it but if you look at the statistics somewhere between maybe just 10 to 20% of the population are natural lucid dreamers and so from an evolutionary perspective I could say well if it was so powerful it was so meaningful because we know everyone sleeps and for the most part we can say that almost everyone dreams if that's the case then those must clearly serve a purpose but the fact that very few people are lucid dreamers doesn't that tell us that it isn't necessarily beneficial so from that perspective I can play those numbers there is an inherent flaw in my argument there however because that assumes based on the argument I've just given you that we have stopped evolving and of course we have not and so perhaps that 10 to 10 to 20% of the population who are natural lucid dreamers are at the Forefront of homonid evolution and they're the next Super rate we shouldn't be worried about AI we should be worried about the lucid dreams because they're going to come and take over the world so I can argue it from that perspective which is just a philosophical argument it doesn't have weighted data to it but there is some data some individuals have asked the question is there any changes to your sleep or even the benefits of sleep when you are a lucid dreamer versus not and what's interesting is that for some papers that have been published after nights when people report lucid dreaming they wake up and they don't feel as restored they don't feel as refreshed by their sleep in the morning suggest just as you sort of hinted at the that the lucid dreaming state is associated with perhaps a less deep or more shallow form of REM sleep or a more active state of REM sleep perhaps too active so that it's fatiguing and depleting and upon Awakening you don't get that memory and that body that brain and body reset there are however a few papers that have not found that result so I think right now we don't truly know if the Lucid state is associated with unrefreshing sleep and unrest of sleep but if that proves true then I think that that's one argument the other argument I would put forward against it from that perspective would be think about what we've said regarding the functions of dreaming memory processing but particularly emotional therapy to gift us mental health if we then come along and say presumably you know nature through millions of years of evolution has come up with this this blueprint Manifesto of exactly what should be served up on the dream menu this evening that's there's a reason for that and that reason has been sculpted over millions of years to become wonderfully optimal for us and our emotional mental health and then we come along in the space of a lifetime and perhaps you could argue a little bit humoristic we think h i perhaps know a little bit better than a couple of million years of evolution I'm going to push those things off the rank ordering chart of what gets served up into my dreams and I'm going to supersede that and decide what I would prefer to be dreaming about and again I think that there's no good evidence that you could argue that that isn't true but equally that it is true we just don't know yet it if that is the case that lucid dreaming does produce unrest of sleep in some ways it also begs the question well what is happening in your brain during lucid dreaming is there anything in your brain that would explain why you don't feel refreshed and early studies looking at lucid dreamers when we put them inside of a brain scanner I told you at the start of this episode dream sleep has a unique brain signature memory regions emotion regions motor regions and visual Regions they're all lighting up but then there's this one part of your brain that does the opposite which is the lateral uh left and right sides of your prefrontal cortex The Logical rational thinking controlling regions of your brain those go offline but early studies demonstrated that the activity including the electrical activity over those frontal regions would be down as you were in non lucid dreaming but then when people rise back up and said now I'm lucid dreaming with those leftward flicks that activity was brought back online which makes a lot of mechanistic sense which is all of a sudden the part of your brain that prevented you from having rational logical control has been re-engaged and as a consequence you yourself can re-engage in volitional dictation of the outcome of what you're dreaming some studies however have not replicated that finding because when they looked at it and they took out some uh sort of what we call these um covariates or these confounding factors and I can bore you with what that principle is it removed that result and all of a sudden the prefrontal cortex went back to seemingly being nonactive they did find an alternate result what they found is that the electrical activity of the brain when you go into a lucid dreaming State seems to be a bit more frenetic a bit more active versus non-lucid dreaming states of electrical brain activity and if that's the case if the cortex which is already active is forced to become even more frenetically active when you are in this lucid dream state is that part of the reason that when you wake up from the lucid dreaming and you go about your day your brain just doesn't seem to be at the same operating ability because it's being fatigued above and beyond it's like saying I do a standard workout and I always go to you know one or two reps before failure but now as I'm lucid dreaming I am constantly going to complete muscle failure and then the next few days if you go and do a workout and I've been listening you and I have been trading workouts I don't want to do an Andrew hubman workout trust me you are this man is mine are short short and sweet this I I'm well let we'll work out at some point together but it's it's almost as though then no big surprise that after you do a legs day if I were to wake you up the next day and say you're back doing legs she said I can't do that I'm toast I'm host my legs are done and that's what we think could perhaps explain why you get that fatigue does that make some sense makes very good sense and you know in the absence of of better language to put to it I've long thought that one of the best things about sleep is that we are not engaging our frontal cortex that much in sleep um and as we talked about in an earlier episode The frontal cortex during waking is responsible for things such as the suppression of reflexes I mean it has to do that according to context of a situation it's a lot of work um and the frontal cortex does a great number of other things as well but I think one of the most wonderful things about sleep is that we get re release and um a break from all of that analysis of duration path and outcome you know what's how long is something going to take what path is it do I need to take in order together what's the outcome going to be all that analysis of things past present and future it's work it's it's mental it's mental work and I think that if if you tell me and I think you just did that lucid dreaming involves any kind of um encroachment of duration path outcome type of

And the parafacial nucleus is involved in any time you double up the inhales or double up the exhales. It was designed so that you could breathe while you're speaking because you can't always go inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale when you're speaking. So, I tell you this, not to overwhelm you with knowledge, but just know that when you double up your inhales or you double up your exhales, you are activating this parafacial nucleus. And it has other cool effects. Because it's located near the neurons that control the face, it also has a tendency to relax the jaw. There's some interplay between the neurons that control the speaking stuff and the stuff for your tongue. So, all of a sudden, when we do this physiological sigh, we tap into neural circuitry that allows us to speak more clearly, to control the muscles of the face and jaw. Maybe that means not saying certain things when we're stressed,"}

in the fasted State this is something that we talked about in an earlier episode but I think it's worth highlighting now um Sometimes the best way to supplement if you will a workout or pre-workout is ingesting nothing I I'm one of these people I actually prefer to do my weight training somewhere between 7 and 8: a.m. each morning sometimes a little earlier sometimes a little bit later I drink fluid water and I do ingest caffeine prior to those uh training days um on days when I don't train I do as I often recommend uh people do delay my caffeine intake 90 to 120 minutes after waking but in any event it's water and caffeine yate or coffee or some sort of stimulant for weight training workouts and generally not for cardiovascular training workouts although sometimes yes so I'm training fasted that said I'm ingesting carbohydrate the night before to make sure that my I have glycogen stores that are topped off and uh so it's fasted but with that caveat what are your thoughts on training fasted and what I just described is fasted overnight but some people are training in the afternoon and they may opt to not eat anything in the you know two to four hours prior to training or maybe even longer I personally find that caffeine hits my system a lot better when I'm fasted better meaning it just seems to have more of a potent effect there are some reasons for that um and of course we dissuade people from ingesting Caff too late in the day cuz you'll disrupt sleep so I'm not saying fast for 3 hours then drink caffeine but who knows maybe that's in your protocol the simple version of this question is what are your thoughts on training fasted and if people are going to train fasted how should they modulate their fluid intake if at all what happens with exercise in the endurance and Metabolism episode we walk through in the fact that no matter what you're using for fuel carbohydrates or fat or even um other potential sources the end product of all of those is ATP CO2 and water right so you're trying to make ATP that is the fuel for exercise now ATP is a Denine triphosphate so one two three phosphates on top of an adenosine well what you may have not put together is if you hydrolyze ATP and you break off one of those phosphates you now have ADP if you do it again you have a a Denine monophosphite if you do it one more time now you just have adenosine and if you have then therefore run through a lot of exercise burned a lot of energy you have increase the amount of adenosine that's floating around now if you have a high concentration of adenosine what's that going to make you want to do that's going to bind to certain receptors and we know when those receptors get bound to you fall asleep Bingo caffeine will competitively bind to those receptors therefore that's why caffeine stops you from feeling like you want to go to sleep right so we have a very clear relationship between exercise fuel in fact if you look at the literature there's a pretty clear relationship between the more caloric expenditure in different sports and the higher amount of hours needed for sleep so there is a nice tie between how hard you're exercising how much energy you're burning how much you need to sleep stimulant which brings us all the way back to your question of fueling so do I need a fuel prior to my exercise bout if you're going to be limited in your exercise bout by Fuel then fueling is necessary one way or the other if it is a type of training that is not then it's not going to matter and so the examples we gave uh if you're doing if you're going to go do a 30- second bout of maximal exertion and you're going to do it one time you don't need to worry about fueling at all or eating within your workout CU it's only 30 seconds yeah you get 30 seconds you don't need to worry about hydration post exercise you don't need to worry about recovery total energy expenditure was nothing uh if you're going to go um you know you're going to go practice you're going to go to the driving range and practice your golf swing you don't need to worry about it the total amount of energy expenditure is just not high in fact in that case you might want to keep it somewhat low because you want to keep blood glucose fairly even and you don't want to bring it in the system you certainly wouldn't want to use stimulants right because you may get over exerted inside in all of these things we probably should have started off our conversation with this in terms of macronutrients the total amount throughout the day is more important generally than the timing of them which is why you can do things like have a bunch of carbohydrate at night not eat the next morning and lift and be just fine it doesn't matter that you didn't have them in a few hours before your muscle glycogen is topped off your liver is glycogen is topped off you're absolutely fine you have plenty of fuel even if you to wait a few more hours in fact even if you were to do conditioning you're probably fine I have plenty of athletes that prefer to do many of their training sessions faster the morning for personal reasons not because it enhances performance but if it doesn't enhance or uh harm it then and it's a personal preference thing fine if you're going to go do a session though where you're going to be really concerned with muscle glycogen depletion and again you can go back that episode to learn of different types uh when those thresholds hits and what you worry about it then feeling would be important you would either need to have something before the session or consume it during the session so one of the other things we' like to say here is recovery starts during the previous workout right so if you're working out right now and you optimize nutrition right now even if you don't necessarily need it for the current workout if you can get ahead on recovery then you're going to be fine the next day and the differentiation here between carbohydrate and protein is important so the total amount of protein you ingest throughout the day is probably a bigger determinant for things like muscle growth than the timing so the post exorcize anabolic window it doesn't necessarily matter carbohydrate is different the timing of that does matter it needs to be around and available so you can maximize both hydration and muscle glycogen resynthesis which is restoring the muscle glycogen you burn during exercise um I also work with athletes that train multiple times a day so in those particular cases recovery window is half what you normally have so if you're in a situation where you have two or three days before you work out again you don't need to worry about getting carbohydrate in before during or after Because by the time you go to train again you will have restored your muscle glycogen levels easily however if you're training every day or twice in a day then the timing of carbohydrate really starts to matter and in that case I see no reason to not ingest those nutrients either before during or after you don't need need to necessarily do it but you can the general rule of thumb I give is something like this um if you're doing something where you're trying to really work hard whether this is hypertrophy training or a lot of endurance energy expenditure is going to be high potential muscle damage is high and or energy utilization is high what you want to look for is a number something in the area of like half a gram of carbohydrate per pound of body weight so you weigh 200 pound you want to make sure that either premid or post or total you bring in 100 grams of carbohydrate it's just a very rough number to start protein is about half of that so it's about a quarter of your body weight right so those numbers would be if you're 200 pounds make sure you have 100 grams of carbs and 50 grams of protein and again it doesn't necessarily have to be before or during or after and you'll be in a good spot all you need to do then is Alter well what I do I should say is Alter the amount of carbohydrate based on energy expenditure so a lower energy an easier workout instead of having 100 grams of carbs I might tack that down to 75 or even 50 and be one to one carb protein ratio if it was even harder more sun hotter outside more fluid loss I might go from 100 grams of carbs up to 150 or 200 and get closer to like a 3 to1 or 4 to1 carbohydrate to protein ratio so those are the numbers that I generally go by well as I take a sip of My Double"}
{"question": "How can incorporating cognitive empathy and empathic concern into our daily lives help protect us from burnout, and what are some practical ways to cultivate these types of empathy?", "doc_id": "X8Hw8zeCDTA_21", "video_id": "X8Hw8zeCDTA", "video_title": "Dr. Maya Shankar: How to Shape Your Identity & Goals", "video_header": "Building Self Narratives: Empathy, Burnout", "segment_idx": "21", "time_start": "2:08:17", "time_end": "2:13:53", "context": "But also returning to a topic that we opened today's discussion with. We build these narratives about ourselves starting in adolescence, maybe even earlier and through our teen years, and we have various experiences. But I'm curious how we can continue to build narratives about ourselves and the role of narrative, the I statements, the I am statements, and whether or not you and we should all spend some time doing this. I mean, these days people exercise because we know it's good for us. I hope people get sunlight because they know it's great for them that people perhaps have a meditation practice or a therapy practice or a journaling practice. But how is it that we can continue to evolve our narratives about self in a way that promotes some or all of the things that we've been talking about today? Maya Shankar: Yeah. So empathy is really interesting because I think we have a lot of misconceptions about it, and we have misconceptions about how empathetic we actually are. I would argue people are more empathetic than they think, and let me tell you why. So, this comes from research by my friend Jamil Zaki at Stanford. There're three distinct types of empathy a lot of people don't know about. So the first kind is emotional empathy, and this is the one that feels very intuitive to most of us. So it's this visceral reaction I have. You tell me that you've had a really hard time. My eyes start to well up. I can truly feel your pain, and I just feel what you feel, okay? And that typically, is what people think of when they think of empathy, period. They overlook two other types of empathy. The second type is called cognitive empathy. This is the ability to accurately diagnose what it is that's causing you distress in this moment, and what it is that I could offer up to you to try to help ameliorate some of your suffering. The third kind is called empathic concern, or it's known as compassion as well, which is the actual desire to help, you desire to help another person. And what's so interesting about these three types of empathy is that they don't correlate within people. You can be really high on the emotional empathy scale, right? You can have tears streaming down your face as you hear about your friend's divorce, but you might be really bad at diagnosing what it is that's causing them distress. You might be really bad at actually offering up a solution to their problem. Or you might lack the will. Like, if you're sociopathic, you might just not have the will to help someone. And what's so interesting is that, I think in our society, this relates back to identity and the labels we give ourselves. I think our society puts a huge premium on emotional empathy, and we discount people who don't have that visceral response, and we just immediately say, oh, they're not empathetic. And this happens from the time that we're really little, by the way, like the kid who's crying on the playground, comforting their friend, right? They're like, wow, that kid's got a ton of empathy. My older kid doesn't seem to really care about people, but they might excel in cognitive empathy. They might excel when it comes to empathic concern. So one of the things I was talking about with Jamil on A Slight Change of Plans , you know, maybe we ought to think about empathy languages in the same way we think about love languages. People have different ways of expressing their empathy, and we ought to value them equally. And that's been wonderful, because I think even in the past, I would have had a really hard situation, and I go to one of my friends, and they just seem like, a little bit more stoic. And I'm like, do you even give a shit? Why do you not care as much as I want you to care? It turns out they're fantastic at wanting to help me and understanding what's wrong with me. And I love the idea of giving a little more love to those second two buckets, because I think it'll allow us to better recruit more empathy from others and also to see ourselves differently, maybe for those people out there who are like, I'm not a very empathetic person. You might actually be more empathetic than you think. The second thing I wanted to share is about burnout. So you talked a little bit about burnout. People who rate really high on the emotional empathy scale tend to experience burnout at higher rates. So you can imagine healthcare workers, first responders, essentially what you're doing when you feel emotional empathy is you're carrying the burden of the other person's pain. So you can easily imagine how that can deplete you. And I think the instinct that we have when we're empathetic is to say, you know what? I'm just going to shut myself off. I had that experience in 2020. I was like, there's too much bad stuff happening around me. Like, I prefer to just not feel things. Thank you very much. And so I tried to close myself off from natural emotional reactions I would have to things. But what Jamil's research shows is that you don't actually have to. If you cultivate cognitive empathy and empathic concern, those can actually be protective against burnout. So you don't have to do away with empathy altogether. You just have to shift gears and be more selective about the kind of empathy that you're investing in. So I love this research because, again, it just opens your mind up to this whole world of empathy that you might have thought of as more as, like, the singular concept and allows there to be a little bit more grace space. Andrew Huberman: I love the idea that there are different categories of empathy. It will also arm me with a response, if ever, hypothetically, someone says, I don't feel like you're really feeling what I'm feeling, and therefore you're not empathic. To my experience, where I rate on these scales isn't important. But this notion of cognitive empathy, I think, is really important and probably one that most people haven't heard of. I certainly haven't heard of it, but I like to think that it really does exist and that it's at least-- Maya Shankar: --And you might have it in spades. Andrew Huberman: I don't know. You'd have to ask the people close to me. But that it is at least as important as the emotional empathy before we conclude there is something that I unfortunately pushed us past too quickly that I want to"}

If things go well, they're able to do that to a really deep degree. Maybe it's the relived trauma? Maybe it's the beauty of their ability to connect to things in the world? And I want to talk about the transition out of that state, and then the export into life, because this is really where the power of psychedelic seems to be in the therapeutic sense, is the ability to learn, truly learn, from that experience, so that the learning becomes the default. That one doesn't have to remind themselves, oh, I am... You know, they don't have to do an affirmation, I am a happy person, I am a... You know, I always think of Bart Simpson - Right - writing on the chalkboard. - Yeah. - It didn't work for him It doesn't work for this other stuff too. So as they transition out of this state, I know that there's a kind of a heightened, there's a so-called peak, - Yeah. - where everything seems to be kind of cascading in at such a level that the person just, they can't really turn it off at that point. - Right. - It would be challenging. And then they start to exit the effects of the drug. Are those transition zones, are those valuable, much like is the transition between a dream and the waking state valuable? Because you're in a sort of mishmash of altered reality and new reality. - Right. - What do you do to guide people through the, out the tunnel, as they exit the tunnel? - Yeah. And I have to say, this is where we need more experimentation. Really, the clinical model goes back to literally the late 1950s, and there's been virtually no experimentation on, let's say, randomized people to... We're going to talk more during the latter half of the session, versus not. Versus we have them write an essay after their session, versus not. Versus we have this amount of integration. [interposing voices] - In your studies, are they writing or talking as they're doing it? - So- And it's called a very loosey goosey term, integration, but for us means, as they're coming back from the experience, so sort of five, six hours in, so this is the afternoon, they've been dosed around nine o'clock, so this is like four o'clock or so, just some initial, tell us about the experience. Do you want to... Not unpacking it totally, but just kind of initially just have a little bit of discussion before they go home. So there's a little bit of that. But then, that night, their homework is to write something. So it could be a few bullet points. It could be 20 pages. And we get everything in that range. But try not to be self-critical. It's not graded. This is just to process, and for a point of discussion the next day. So they write something, they come in the next day for one to two hour, depending on the study, \"integration session\", basically, let's discuss your experience. And depending on what study it's in, like what that mean for... You're dealing with cancer, what might that mean for your smoking, or becoming a non smoker? So you encourage them to simply take it seriously. And I think this is, again, a sort of, one of the points that could be the antithesis of what some just kind of social users use. I mean, this was written about by Huston Smith, the scholar of religion, in terms of these mystical experiences that can happen from psychedelics, and how a lot of times, the attribution to a drug effect is dismissed. Even if one has this sense of being one with the universe, and it totally shakes their soul, so to speak, but the next day, their friends are like, ah, dude, you were screwed up! Too much acid for you! Whoo! You know? Like, man, next time, you needed to have a few more beers to bring that down. You know, like this sort of social reinforcement for dismissing the experience. Oh, god, you were talking out of your head, man. Even if it's good natured, but it's this dismissal. It's not like... What you want to do is like, tell me more about that. You know, you were crying at one point in talking about your mom. Let's talk about that. What was that like? Do you remember that? [interposing voices] - Are you doing that follow-up, or they're encouraged to do that in their own life with the various people in their life? - Both. So we do that explicitly in the follow-up, where we have these discussions. Depending on what the situation is, you might encourage the person to kind of follow-up. It's really, the basics of it is, is supportive therapy. It's non-structured. It's use all the reflective listening, and the sort of the humanistic psychology thing, unconditional positive regard for the person. But I think, if someone feels inclined to apologize to their sibling about some things, like, yeah, go ahead and call 'em up. With something big, like a relationship change, I'd be like, sit on that two weeks. Don't make any big... Don't end any relationship. Don't quit your job. Don't make any big- - Do you also tell them not to start any relationships? - I don't remember that ever coming up. - Interesting. - But if it- - I'm not joking. I was just wondering, you know? - Yeah. - But it makes sense why you would want- - Like if they're dating, and they're thinking like, ah, it might be time to take it to the next level. Should I ask this girl to marry me? If it did come up, I would say there too, why don't you sit on that a week or two? - Yeah, don't get a puppy. - And let your sober mind- - Don't get a puppy. Certainly, don't get four puppies until your... I have a question about flashbacks."}
{"question": "What are the best habits to adopt in the first 8 hours after waking up to help overcome limbic friction and establish new habits?", "doc_id": "Wcs2PFz5q6g_12", "video_id": "Wcs2PFz5q6g", "video_title": "The Science of Making & Breaking Habits", "video_header": "Tool 3: Phase-Based Habit Plan: Phase 1", "segment_idx": "12", "time_start": "38:18", "time_end": "46:27", "context": "It's actually an entire program by which you can insert particular habits and activities at particular phases of the day, not times of day, but phases of the day, because it turns out that particular phases of the day are associated with particular biological underpinnings, chemicals and neural circuits and so forth, and in doing so it will make it far more likely that you will be able to regularly engage in these habits and activities over a long period of time. And whether or not that will move you from somebody who ordinarily would take 200 days to form a habit to one of those 18 days to habit people in that earlier study I mentioned, I don't know. But I am certain that will have a significant shift on allowing you to engage in particular habits more easily and to consolidate those habits more quickly. So the program I am about to describe, I formulated for you based on the neuroscience literature, and the psychology literature of learning, and this concepts of task-bracketing. It involves the 24 hour days into what I call three phases. The first is phase one, which is 0 to 8 hours after waking up, approximately. Okay, you can put a plus or minus 30 minutes on this for yourself. The second phase is the 9 to 14, maybe 15 hours after you wake up. And the third phase is 16 to 24 hours after waking up. So we've taken the 24 hour cycle, we've carved it up into three phases, phase one, phase two, and phase three. Now, everything I'm describing, or at least the way I'm going to describe it, is based on what I would call a typical schedule, diurnal schedule. You've heard of nocturnal? Well, we are diurnal. Most of us are asleep at night and awake during the day. I do realize that a number of people have shift work or they have newborns or other reasons why they have to be up in the middle of the night and sleeping during the day. If that's the case, please listen to the episode we did on jet-lag and shift work because that has a lot of tools specifically for that population. But most people go to sleep somewhere around 10:00 PM, plus or minus two hours, and wake up some time around 7:00 AM, plus or minus two hours. So today, I'm going to use the to bed at 10:00 PM and a wake up time of 7:00 AM as the framework for this, but you could adopt it easily to your particular schedule. Phase one, which again, is 0 to 8 hours after waking, has a particular neurochemical signature. Regardless of what you do, the neuromodulators norepinephrine as well as epinephrine, so that's noradrenaline and adrenaline, as well as the neuromodulator dopamine tend to be elevated during that first 0 to 8 hours after waking. There are a number of reasons for this related to the fact that also cortisol is higher in our brain and bloodstream, it's a healthy level of cortisol upon waking, body temperature is increased, et cetera. And there's several things that perhaps we should all be doing, I've talked about many of these on the podcast before, that in addition to those chemicals, further support an alert and focused state. And I'll just list those off. I've done many podcasts on each of these if you'd like to access those podcasts you can find them in the menu of podcasts on YouTube, Apple, Spotify, et cetera. They involve, for instance, viewing sunlight or bright artificial light if you can't access sunlight, within the first 30 minutes of waking. Physical exercise of some kind in this phase of the day, 0 to 8 hours of the day, ideally pretty early in that phase, but, you know, if it has to be at the 7 to 8 hour transition point that's fine too. Cold exposure in the form of cold showers or ice baths or outside with minimal clothing, appropriate yet minimal clothing. Caffeine ingestion. Fasting, for instance, not ingesting calories, also will lend itself to increased norepinephrine and dopamine, et cetera. If you are going to consume foods, foods that are rich in things like tyrosine, which is a precursor for dopamine. You can look up foods that are high in tyrosine. And for those of you that are interested in supplementation and like to use those routes, things like alpha GPC or phenylethylamine, think, or L-tyrosine, if that's in keeping with what you're able to do. Of course, consult your doctor if you're going to rely on supplementation. What's this all about? Well, the already elevated norepinephrine and dopamine, the sunlight, exercise, cold exposure, caffeine, tyrosine, et cetera, all of those place the brain and body into a state in which you are better able, or I would say, more easily able, to engage in activities that have a high degree limbic friction and where you need to override that limbic friction. Right? We've heard that the morning is kind of sacred, conquer the hardest things first thing in the morning, and that's been discussed in the pop psychology literature and in the habit formation literature merely from the perspective of get it out of the way so you can feel good about having done it. But what I'm referring to is quite different. What I'm referring to is a particular phase of day that after rising, after waking up, that is, for 0 to 8 hours, right, in that first phase, your whole system is action and focus oriented. And we know that when you're action and focus oriented and because of the neurochemicals that are naturally released in your brain and body that you will be more likely to overcome any limbic friction that stands in the way of performing particular habits. So, as you list out or think about the various habits that you'd like to adopt in your life, take the habits for which you know there's the highest degree of limbic friction, they are the hardest for you to engage in, they require the most activation energy, and put those in this 0 to 8 hours after waking. This will greatly facilitate your performance of those new habits. I'm certain of that. And in addition to that, by doing them in this particular phase of the day, not necessarily the same time, I mean, if you want to be very habitual, and you want to do, you know, the exercise, or the sunlight viewing always at the same time, or you want to do, you want to drink your caffeine always at the exact same time, that's fine, but by placing them in this broader window of 0 to 8 hours after waking, what you're doing is you're creating task-bracketing. You're making it such that your nervous system will predict when you are going to lean in against limbic friction in order to perform particular types of habits. And this is very different than saying, \"I'm always going to run\" or, \"I'm always going to study from 10 to 12 AM every morning.\" That's great, and if you can do that, terrific. But the literature indicates that people who do that, who are very rigid about when they do things tend, because of context dependence, to not necessarily stick to those habits over time. Some people do, but many, many people don't. So think about the hardest habits to form and the habits that you most want to form that are hardest for you to adopt and to maintain and I highly suggest placing those somewhere within this phase one of 0 to 8 hours after waking. Now of course, some of the things I listed out, sunlight viewing, exercise, cold exposure, caffeine, fasting, those might be the actual habits themselves, but here I realize, or rather I want to acknowledge that many people, including myself, are doing some or all of these things already and many people, including myself, are trying to adopt new habits that don't fall into the category of just trying to set your overall state. Again, norepinephrine, dopamine, and all these neural systems will be greatly elevated in this 0 to 8 hours after waking. However, the other things I mentioned, sunlight exposure, exercise, cold exposure, caffeine, fasting, if that's for you, or if you're eating during that phase, eating things that contain some or elevated levels of tyrosine, maybe supplementing alpha GPC or L-tyrosine, et cetera. All of those things further facilitate the neurochemistry and therefore the state of mind that's going to be ideal for leaning into limbic friction and overriding that limbic friction so that you can regularly perform that habit. What we're really talking about here is leveraging neural systems in order to help you make it more likely that you're going to be able to engage and maintain a particular habit. So what I'm referring to as phase one of each day is useful for acquiring certain habits,"}

We're also going to clean up some common myths about stress. For instance, that stress impairs your immune system. That's true in certain contexts. And in other contexts, stress actually enhances your immune system and makes it function better. There is going to be a lot of discussion about whether or not our internal state, whether or not we are alert or calm is good or bad, depending on the circumstances. So, where we're headed here is I'd like you to come away from today's episode with what I call an organizational logic, a framework for thinking about these things that typically we just call happy or sad or depressed or anxious. And I'm going to make sure that you have tools that are grounded in physiology and neuroscience that will allow you to navigate this otherwise complex space that we call emotions that will allow you to ground yourself better when you're feeling like life is weighing on you, where you're kind of being pulled by the currents of life as well as to support other people whether or not that's in a psychological practice if you're a practitioner, or you have clients or children or spouses, really, to be able to support other people in your environment better. And the tools that I'm going to focus on today range from behavioral tools. We will talk about some of the more valuable supplementation tools that are out there. And we're going to talk a little bit about things like depression, PTSD, but we will be devoting entire episodes to things like depression, PTSD, and even attention deficit and obsessive compulsive disorder, which believe it or not, although this might not surprise many of you, have a very strong emotional component. It's just not just about compulsive behaviors and intrusive thoughts. It's also about the emotional load of being in that state. So, I promise that today we're going to clean up a lot of misunderstanding. We're going to give you a lot of tools and you're going to learn a lot about the biology of how your body and brain work together. Because if ever there was a topic that brought together the brain and body or mind-body relationship, it's stress and emotions. It's also the positive emotions. When we feel something, whether or not we're super happy or just feeling kind of pleasant or we are feeling stressed, anxious, and overwhelmed, it isn't just in our head. It's also in our body. And as you may recall, the nervous system, which includes the brain and the eyes and the spinal cord, but also all the connections with the organs of the body includes the brain and body. And those organs of the body, your gut, and your liver, and your spleen, they're also communicating with the brain. So, I look forward to a day, in fact, when we no longer think about neuroscience as just the brain. And many neuroscientists now also think about the body, of course. And the brain controls the body, but the body is also having a very profound and concrete influence on the brain. I think up until recently, people would hear about kind of brain-body and always think about mindfulness. We're actually not going to talk that much about mindfulness at all today. Mindfulness is kind of a vague concept, in fact. When you think about mindfulness, it's good to take the opposite. What's the opposite of mindfulness? Would be mindlessness. Well, all of a sudden we're into territory that isn't really easy for one person to describe their experience or to help others with their experience. Today, we're going to talk about objective tools that match the brain-body experience or separate the brain-body experience in ways that leverage your ability to lean into life better, to feel better, literally to just feel better about what you're experiencing, and believe it or not, to be able to control your emotions when that's appropriate. This isn't about becoming robotic. This isn't about trying not to feel human. This is actually about being able to lean into life better as a consequence of being able to control some of your inner real estate. This nervous system that includes the brain and body and how that nervous system is interacting with the outside world. So, it's to place you in a greater position of power. And so, let's get started in deciphering what is stress, what are emotions, and why did I batch stress and emotions into one discussion today? Okay. So, what is stress? We hear all the time that stress is bad. We hear people saying they're really stressed out."}

"context": "have a hypothesis and I don't want to force you into speculation but given that you've studied and discovered that the neurons and circuits involved in appetitive and consummatory behaviors can learn based on experience and expectation I think it's fair game to at least ask your thoughts on this so I've been paying a lot of attention to the landscape of what the general public think about um let's call them elimination diets where people will just eat meat yes or will go onto a vegan diet or do some time restricted feeding or do any number of different things that have been shown to promote weight loss provided people obey the laws of thermodynamics and consume fewer calories than they um than they burn yeah right I do believe in calories in calories out and there are a number of different routes to get there and some are more painful some are less painful and it depends on the individual lifestyle exercise and on and on but let's just suppose for a moment based on Kevin's work on highly processed foods versus Whole Foods that there's a learning that takes place when we eat yes and that this learning takes place over time such that our brain and appetite start to link the variables of taste macronutrients proteins fats and carbohydrates sort of knowledge about macronutrients a piece of fish is mostly protein has some fat a bowl of rice is mostly carbohydrate has some protein yeah put a pat of butter on it has some fat also right it's sort of obvious but taste macronutrient content calories which we already know people with anorexia are exquisitely good at counting with their eyes so it's possible they represent again a pathologic stream of this and micronutrient content maybe even amino acid content like how much Lucine is there now most people aren't thinking about how much Lucine is in a meal but we know that Lucine is important for certain aspects of muscle metabolism it's um present in certain proteins and not others you're going to find less of it in a vegetable typically than you would in a piece of chicken and and so on and that when people eat mostly nonprocessed or minimally processed foods and not in combination so we're not talking about stewing all this together or blending all of it together which G sounds disgusting right broccoli rice and a chicken breast blend together just sounds horrible but eating them separately if there's some olive oil and a little Pat of butter involved like that sounds pretty good but a highly processed food in some ways is a blending together of macronutrients micronutrients if there are any um and other features of the food that neurons in the brain seem to pay attention to and then giving it a unified taste a Dorito right um a candy bar that we attach to the product we attached to the name of the processed food to the packaging but I could imagine and here's the hypothesis that that is quote unquote confusing to our neural circuits in a way that doesn't match up well with our thermodynamic requirements of how much we're burning versus how much we need to eat whereas when I eat a piece of steak and a vegetable I actually want less carbohydrate afterwards if I eat the carbohydrate first for me it's difficult because I love the taste of carbohydrates especially when they're combined with fat but there's seems to be an easier time regulating food intake when people step back and say I'm going to consume minimally processed Whole Foods and I'm guessing it's not just because um they're trying to be healthier that might be what stimulates the the shift but that the brain starts to learn the relationship between food volume smell taste um what these things look like and satiation at the level of oh that's enough amino acids because I had a piece of fish so maybe I don't need to consume as much of some other things or the vegetables provide volume and fiber and often vegetables can taste really delicious too so that there's a there's a linking of nutrients calories and taste in a way that's more appropriately matched to the energetic demands of the organism this case us humans that highly processed foods bypass yeah okay now I realized that was long-winded and forgive me but my audience is used to that whenever I'm trying to table something for no pun intended for a discussion that I would like to think can at least stimulate some additional thinking about a landscape in this case nutrition and and feeding behavior that for a lot of people is just really confusing and here's why and this is the last thing I'll say I have several friends who have been very overweight their entire lives for whom the following diet has worked exceptionally well I'm not a diet coach I'm not a nutritionist I don't pretend to be one I say eat proteins like meat fish eggs vegetables and fruit and do that for a couple of months and then add back in starches as you um see fit based on your food intake and without fail they all lose a ton of weight they're very happy with that they add back in a minimum of starches they keep the weight off and they they're also exercising but not more than they were before in most cases and I don't think that it's meat or fish or vegetables per se I think it's that they finally develop an appreciation for what different foods have in in terms of what they actually need and without fail they all say oh you know on I went to this party and I had a piece of cake and it didn't taste good to me after three or four bites so that's interesting too so I just would like your thoughts on this we're not defining any new diets I don't sell any diets I don't do any of that but I find it amazing that when people start eating minimally processed Whole Foods I have to assume that their brain changes as it relates to appetite craving and just kind of a an unconscious understanding about what food is providing them or not and that highly processed foods basically bypass all of this and just get you to consume more perhaps in hopes of getting something that you probably aren't getting at all or that you need to consume a lot of this food in order to get yeah there's several interesting ideas there so there's two that come to mind just thinking about what you just said so the one is the idea of what's going on when these people uh consume simpler diets more of of Whole Foods and and one one thing I think that's very likely going on is this phenomenon of sensory specific satiety is being engaged and so um uh sensory specific satiety is just the idea that as you expose yourself repeatedly to a certain flavor or taste you um you basically lose appetite for that you get specific loss of appetite for that flavor or taste this is why as you said basically if you start off eating the protein after a while I don't want any more salmon but I would like some carbohydrates now because you have the sensory specific satiety and so um it's well known actually that if you simplify your diet make your diet really simple so there's just a few things then sensory specific satiety alone can cause you to eat less basically because there's just less Variety in your diet and you don't want to eat more of that same thing and so and so I think a lot of diets actually it's not about the specific macronutrient or the specific food it's just that they're reducing the variable the the variety in the diet eventually you just get sick of eating the same thing and you know this is the thought behind that idea is that it's it's important evolutionarily so that you eat a diverse diet it's the reason probably that you want sweets after you've eaten a Savory meal and so on a second idea though that comes to mind is just as you mentioned this idea of learning and and so much about our our preferences for food are they're not an a they're driven by learning right and so so you know there are some things that are a so if you put sugar on a baby's T tongue you know it'll smile indicating that it likes it and if you uh put something bitter it'll frown and a rat will do the same thing a neonate rat but most of flavor and the perception of food is not just sweet or bitter it's this much more complex Sensation that involves smells it involves tastes and then it involves how those tastes and smells interact with the post-ingestive effects of the nutrients so the sensing of those nutrients in your stomach and in your intestine primarily in your intestine are thought to then feed back and then change your preference for these foods and so you know there's lots of examples of this that you can just imagine from everyday experience most people the first time they had a beer or the first time they had a glass of coffee found it repulsive right because it's extremely bitter but then we come to Crave these things because we know what they do to our body we like what they do to our body and that doesn't just make us take them like they're medicine we actually somehow change our very perception of how that flavor is we actually come to savor that flavor we previously found disgusting and it's because our sensation of what is what is whether something's good or bad depends on an internal State and so it's an interesting idea you know perhaps if these Ultra processed foods that have so many different ingredients and such an unnatural combination perhaps this process of learning about the nutrient content of different foods and flavors becomes impaired because it's just the brain is not used the brain's used to saying you know this is a piece of chicken and this is primarily protein and so I can gauge you know from this Flav I can connect this flavor to an amino acid content but something that's so diverse it might be harder to do and"}

{"question": "Does cannabis, particularly high-THC cannabis, increase the risk of psychosis and anxiety, especially in young males?", "doc_id": "jouFvyRZntk_20", "video_id": "jouFvyRZntk", "video_title": "Dr. Matthew Hill: How Cannabis Impacts Health & the Potential Risks", "video_header": "Psychosis, Anxiety & Cannabis", "segment_idx": "20", "time_start": "2:07:08", "time_end": "2:17:16", "context": "that one um I I'm in total agreement with you um by the way I want to make sure that I ask about psychosis and paranoia yeah um I've previously said and I was sort of I wasn't joking but I have um observed um in my history that uh when people started to uh experience some degree of anxiety or paranoia when um smoking cannabis that sometimes the message they would receive back is to take more to just adjust the the subjective experience I think that's a terrible idea um terrible idea baffled that you heard that I have no idea let's say I did more than hear it um see I I've observed it I I cannot even understand that that is the strangest thing I've ever heard but okay yeah well usually the advice of of of people in terms of that was recreational drug taking is um is rarely excellent advice that's that's so I I mean I agree with you on that point for sure that you should not be consuming more if you're having a bad reaction to it because that will just like Grease the wheels going downhill for sure yeah um I also am aware that there are some very high-profile papers that been published in the last really 5 years or so pointing to potential increased risk for psychosis of lasting duration um even after the effects of cannabis have worn off in high THC cannabis users in particular high THC cannabis users that initiate that cannabis use young and this might be preferentially impacting males I I want to make clear that what I just said is not a statement of absolute fact it's my understanding of the conclusions of these papers um there are other conclusions in these papers also but that particular conclusion seems to be important enough that they place it in the abstract and it's reached major press headlines so I guess the simple question which probably doesn't have a simple answer is does THC cause psychosis so yeah there's not a simple answer to that and I think that also is a question over whether you're talking about acute drug induced psychotic episode versus the development of a chronic um psychotic disease like schizophrenia so um the first arm of that is just can people acutely have a psychotic episode to THC or cannabis and the answer to that is yes it's not common I would say in terms of Adverse Events that happen with people consuming cannabis it's on the rarer side um but it definitely can happen so less than 5% of people that oh much less than that I mean certainly I mean it's if something like this was happening at a regular frequency it would be very well known what about anxiety attack yeah anxiet attack is I'd say more of a standard uh indication that someone's kind of gone overboard like that's not dosage overboard or does it carry the same set and setting considerations that um you know psychedelics like psilocybin have uh both so I think there's some contextual component to it there was like I mean back in the 70s when they did more let's say interesting studies there's one where basically they dosed people on THC and then had them undergo oral surgery which seems like in hindsight a very bad idea and I think virtually everyone in that study had a panic attack like so it really potentiated the stress of what they were undergoing and had they been given that same dose in a different setting I'm not sure it would have evoked that kind of response but there is definitely a dose effect to this in terms of like you know the kind of classic lowd do aspects of like of THC or cannabis like that are usually considered more the positive pleasurable responses that are why people use like it reduces anxiety it relaxes blah blah blah um that is more of like a low to normal-ish dose let's say of what someone consumes to produce those responses if they start going upwards though it's not like it's graded it's like a full flip like it's not linear at all it's almost like it goes in the opposite direction so you know someone can use cannabis to reduce anxiety but then cannabis can also trigger anxiety in other people and even in the same person if they consume too much and a lot of this at least we think has to do with the ability of it to regulate both excitatory neurotrans and inhibitory and so for reasons that we don't totally understand there's like way more cannaboid receptors on inhibitory neurons than there is on excitatory neurons but in the early days of creating the genetic lines um gavan Marano and beat Luts over in Europe created um like deletion of CB1 only from excitatory neurons or only from inhibitory neurons okay so to just clarify for people these are um laboratory mice that are genetically modified so that they contain or lack specific receptors on particular neuron type so that researchers can parse the effects of THC on what we're referring to as inhibitory neurons which quiet other neurons versus excitatory neurons which excite other neurons and so forth and in doing so to understand some of the network biology um which is basically impossible to do in a typical Mouse what's called a wild type Mouse um or a human um because when one ingests the drug or when the mouse is given the drug it affects any sight in the brain potentially any site in the brain where the CB1 expressor recept do like a full body deletion of CB1 and you give a mouse THC doesn't respond to it at all not surprisingly that's a comforting experiment you want to see that result yeah exactly so that's how we know CB1 drives all the kind of psychoactive effects of THC so if you delete CB1 off of inhibitory gabin neurons even though that removes like 70% of the neuro of the CB1 receptors in the brain those animals look just like wild they still get like they still exhibit all the classic signs of intoxication in terms of how that would respond to like pain sensitivity or Locomotion or these other like assays we use in mice to tell if they're high if you delete the CB1 only off of excitatory neurons the glutamate neurons then you see um what looks like the full knockout so now the animals don't seem to get high so even though the majority of CB1 receptors seem to be on these inhibitory gabin neurons it's the CB1 on the glutamatergic exy neurons that mediate most of the classic signs of what we would consider intoxication from THC or cannabis but what's interesting is um uh bat worked with the Spanish group 10 12 years ago then they showed they're looking at anxiety that if you delete CB1 only off of excitatory neurons you lose the anti-anxiety angiolytic effects of THC but you still have the you know panicky angiogenic effects of hos if you delete CB1 off of only the inhibit at gaban neurons you still have the lowd do anti-anxiety effect but now you don't have the high do angiogenic panicky effect so what that was suggesting was that for some reason CB1 like THC will initially hit CB1 on kind of glutamatergic neurons and essentially the thought is this will reduce excitatory transmission and probably quiet down circuits and if we're talking about something like the amydala this is probably how it's reducing anxiety whereas as dosing starts to increase and you start to saturate the CB1 on the gabin neurons and turn off inhibition then the network effect is more of an amplification and that seems to result in the development of kind of an angiogenic uh pro- anxiety response that's obviously undesirable why there's this differential shift it's not exactly clear I mean it's probably either due to some of the like biology of exactly where the CB1 receptors sit uh on excitatory or inhibitory neurons relative to all the Machinery that regulates transmitter release I mean bat loots has definitely done some stuff looking at the ability of uh cannaboid receptors to evoke signaling responses in a cell and on glutamate neurons they're much more sensitive than they are in gabin neurons so there's probably a dose threshold so it does look like this kind of you know low dosing what most people are trying to achieve I would assume when they consume cannabis is probably these effects mediated by quieting down excitatory transmission and then the adverse effects when someone consumes too much and they have a negative response that's probably due to the the higher starting to saturate on the inhibitory neurons now we obviously can never test something like that in humans because we can't know but based on what we've seen in animals that's my theory of kind of how this is working and why we see these kind of classic biphasic effects so yeah too much THC not a good thing because then you start maybe disinhibiting things like the amigdala producing these kind of panicky angiogenic like outcomes on that scale though I mean paranoia obviously that's a hard I don't know how you study that in a rodent I mean that's just a strange thing so but I mean that's kind of the precedent of when you start going into the psychosis because obviously paranoia would be a big component of that um someone once asked me a question about you you know have you know what happens in the brain um like Imaging wise when someone's having like a psychotic episode from Cannabis and I was kind of thinking like how would that study get done like probably on accident because somebody takes cannabis is in the scanner and then starts having a psychotic episode but chances are they're going to try and get for those that don't know these I don't want to scare people out of doing MRI or fmri but you know you're typically told to stay extremely still there's sometimes even a bite bar you know like this is a very controlled environment not not an environment that you would want to be in during a psychotic episode no I can't actually even imagine how that would go down so I'm like we this is something I don't think we're ever going to have an answer to because I don't think I don't think you can actually ever test it but in terms of people having this kind of psychotic response it is pretty rare I mean and I say this because I can think of Canada kind of whenever it's happened and someone has actually done something wildly unpredictable because they've had a psychotic response to cannabis it tends to make headlines so it's not it's not common I I could not give you an actual number but it's it's certainly not a frequent thing because we would hear about this a lot more if we did and there's also the issue of polypharmacology which is simply when people take one drug then there's often the tendency to take another drug either because it's available in those conditions or because they threshold to say yes is a little bit lower um do most"}

reducing ad risk I believe and in Alzheimer's dementia Alzheimer's risk and in just good cognitive aging and keeping your memory as you get older so to your headphones too loud yes this what right well actually okay so speaking of things I did to preserve my brain health I'm playing in a band now and we're pretty damn loud and so I got I went to an audiologist and I got uh custom earplugs oh yeah yeah all the top music I'm friends with some some really amazing musicians they all wear insert earplugs oh yeah yeah but I think these custom ones will be more effective at both preserving the spectrum of all the frequencies so oh I just mean protect your hearing yeah yeah no but yeah but they're related because if you can't hear your frequencies you might end up turning up and you get this paradoxical sure thing so too much information I know but basically that is yeah so uh there is this issue with in fact actually there's an article that the Shai sent me on in the Lancet that one of their uh um Public Health recommendations is to get into a preventative mode for preventing Alzheimer's disease and one of the things they say is screen for hearing and give people hearing aids and and make people use them if they have encourage people to use them uh vision is starting to be a big one people who are older get cataracts get it treated you know um a lot of this preventative health care which we our system is not really equipped for it but can really save so much money it can save so much emotional pain for so many people it's really amazing another one we me I mentioned briefly is oral hygiene gum disease it turns out increases your risk for I believe it's Alzheimer's and also for cognitive brain health in general I did an episode on oral health and the effects on as you said on brain health are amazing because streptococus mutans which is the bacteria that causes cavities um Can funnel its way into the bloodstream and potentially cross the blood brain barrier which is I think why people think it might be detrimental to brain health yeah yeah I mean I don't know the detailed mechanisms but I I think that makes sense and there's this vague notion of cognitive Reserve which is basically some people seem to be quite immune to the effects of cognitive aging and some people seem to be very protected against Alzheimer's so what is it one of the things that seems to come up as as far as depleting cognitive Reserve or putting at higher risk seems to be um inflammation right neuroinflammation and and uh so Kim mallister as you know was doing work on on this topic of neuroimmune interactions and basically the immune system expresses itself in the brain you get microa activation that can cause these inflammatory responses and there's reasonable evidence suggests that it's interacting with toao and Amid and and this kind of cascade of stuff that happens in Alzheimer's disease right and one of the things that we we're learning now and we don't know nearly enough but the data out there is quite scary in fact is long covid is associated with significant cognitive effects and brain is that uh the explanation for the brain fog that people report many many months so they they report a subjective brain fog and you can see this you can measure this as a significant cognitive deficit that they're experiencing right and we've seen in the past like HIV was there is actually a whole variety of dementia that was associated with HIV from the viral transmission um we can like you can see with multiple sclerosis where you have like autoimmune uh responses in the brain affect mental function dramatically we're seeing more and more evidence of this and so this is again another one of those things it's like people go oh co I don't care about it blah blah blah I mean this is a health thing that can really affect people and it can I don't think anybody it's not a political issue to get brain fog it's just sucks right nobody wants this so I think that there's a lot we're learning about viruses and bacteria one of the the cool things I was talking about before we started recording is um I was at a conference I met the coolest guy and I'm blanking on his name but I'll send it to you Afters um but he's uh he did this great study and he was studying the effects of nutrition on brain health and memory especially cognition and so I what's the most interesting finding that you've gotten I love to ask people this because I'm curious and it stimulates my curiosity and I usually get a good answer so he told me he did this study where he has these rats and he gives them sugary water during the day about the equivalent he said to a can of Coke a day so they're getting this sugar when they reach adulthood you know these teenage rats they reach adulthood and they have memory problems and they do they have hippocampal atrophy so you go okay well the hippocampus is affected memory is affected sugar blah blah blah no problem so then what he does is he takes the gut bacteria from the sugar animals and put in an animal that doesn't get this diet and he finds the same kind of pathology and the same kind of memory deficit in these animals so there's something about that process of like the gut brain interaction that also seems to be playing a part in ways that I don't understand I think they're still figuring it out but again this this really shows this tight neuroimmune link you know we're seeing this now with pollution air pollution is a big factor so even if people don't believe in global warming there nothing good about being in a place with a lot of smoke in the air you know it's uh it definitely can and this is one of the risk factors that is noted in the Lancet report for Alzheimer's disease um one of my colleagues uh Pam L is doing research on this at UC Davis showing that you get like she actually takes real pollution from the calicott tunnel which connects Oakland and and uh Walnut Creek yeah and uh finds that rats exposed to this pollution have hi cample damage and uh um so it's there's so many of these environmental factors that can trigger the inflammatory response we talked about blood sugar blood sugar also seems to be related to these issues so um and diabetes is like so bad in so many ways it It's associated with those white matter hyperintensities that we talk about and so that's bad we've done some research on that and but it also affects um it can cause little uh you can get if you get severe diabetes keto acidosis you can actually have hyp hipocampal damage from that directly and it also dramatically increases Alzheimer's risk an epidemic of diabetes right now this probably explains um at least to my mind why um these lifestyle factors like improve sleep um cardiovascular and resistance training exercise but certainly cardiovascular exercise you know um uh eating a lot of leafy leafy foods Etc um we know all of those things offset inflammation to some degree or another right I mean one of the best ways to inflame your brain and body is to not get enough sleep and eat you know a lot of Highly processed foods for instance um to date are there any even semi satisfactory prescription drugs or other compounds that can slow the progression of Alzheimer's dementia once it's started there are now some drugs that are um I think they're targeting amalo that are producing some modest effects in stalling the progression of the disease see the problem with Alzheimer's as you know is once you lose neurons you're not getting them back right and it's like yeah there's neurogenesis and you can run around but it's not it's not much it's not you don't want to if you're depending on that you're hosed you know so um like but getting back to the exercise thing it's neuroprotective and so like let's say with a drug right I mean everybody wants a drug if I told you give you this drug you're 60 years old and it's going to have some terrible side effects you're going to get diarrhea nausea all this stuff but it'll reduce your risk of Alzheimer's by 40% a lot of people would be motivated to take it now I tell you okay well here's a lifestyle intervention that's going to involve what Sarah medin calls down States doesn't have we can actually get into that and and memory reactivation during down States but um uh involves sleep diet exercise exerise social stimulation right and these things by the way also reinforce each other having better sleep makes it easier to EXC having exercise makes easier better to sleep all of these improve mood right so these will improve your mental function your mood as well as your mental function relatively soon and reduce your risk by at least 40% if not more wow um if you go to I can send you this Lancet article but it's like the amount the proportion of variance meaning the degree of risk that you can reduce with fully preventable or fully in our control lifestyle issues is huge it's as big or bigger than the genetics I think people really need to hear and internalize that because I think everyone's waiting for this miracle drug that is unlikely to ever arrive frankly I mean you know to dat we have some okay treatments for Parkinson's to try and offset the loss of dopaminergic neurons but they can even transplant essentially dopaminergic neurons into the substantia but none of those things alopa Etc have proved to be cures for Parkinson's um not getting hit in the head is helpful oh yeah yeah traumatic brain injury is another one of the big risk factors so there are a lot of don'ts yeah I'm grateful that today you're sharing a number of Dos both in the context of offsetting age relay cognitive decline Alzheimer's but also in terms of how to enhance focus and enhance memory um I want to make make sure that we um touch on a few topics related to memory that a"}
{"question": "Is there a sensitive period during puberty when the brain undergoes significant changes that can influence an individual's sense of identity, and if so, what triggers these changes?",

sensitive periods for this really high level stuff we're not talking Vision or phology which are fairly low-level cognitive things we're talking like your sense of who you are what would you think about a sensitive period for that oh first of all puberty is just fascinating and underd discussed in my opinion as a critical developmental milestone it's also the the fastest rate of Aging that we ever undergo aging meaning in our you know in terms of change of the brain in terms of um rate of uh I mean there are some theories that that the that the rate of puberty and the timing of onset of puberty actually might predict something about longevity oh which way early puberty is B early puberty might be bad but I want to be very careful and saying that some people including myself have a very protracted puberty so I hit puberty around 14 but I didn't get facial hair until I was out of college wow so some people develop the so-called secondary sexual characteristics slowly but I always had this voice since was a little kid so 5 years old they call me froggy now that's me um and everyone goes through these things differently um but puberty is the most profound brain change that one can undergo tell me more about it because I just keep saying like well it starts in the back of the brain and then is but be be specific what is happening to the brain during puberty that would be relevant here to a sensitive period okay so this goes back to the biology that you accurately described earlier which is that while we're in utero if there's a y chromosome then a bunch of genes are made like mulian an inhibiting hormone the malarian ducts become inhibited um the testes grow then testosterone is secreted and testosterone and some of its derivatives like dihydro testosterone organize the brain quote unquote male this is dangerous language nowadays but it's less dangerous now than it was two years ago okay well we're not talking about gender we're talking about biological sex here and we're not talking about the verb sex we were talking about that earlier we're talking about biological sex so what I'm describing here is is not uh disputed the so there these organizing effects of hormones early on and then there're the activating effects of hormones that happen during puberty so then puberty hits the test starts secreting testosterone um if they fat stores on the body they secrete estrogen again testosterone and estrogen working in parallel and in males a number of different brain areas in particular the hypothalamus but also the forebrain and Associated areas undergo massive plasticity in growth relating the with the for brain the frontal lobe right the frontal lobe oh so one of the most profound changes in puberty that happens especially in males but also in females is that well we can describe the the major function of the prefrontal cortex this neural real estate right behind the the forra has many different subdomains involved in things but one of its main functions this was beautifully described by the the guy who's now the head uh neurosurgeon at neurolink Matt McDougall is to say sh to the impulse driving actions of the hypothalamus in particular hypothalamus houses neurons for temperature regulation sexual drive hunger aggression I mean so much so that you can go in and stimulate certain neurons and the ventromedial hypothalamus with an electrode and you would go into a rage wow stimulate neurons also within the ventromedial hypothalamus just nearby and uh you'd want to go spend some time with your wife alone let's just put it that way I mean a remarkable specificity of the neuronal outputs to behavioral change and state change so all of that gets set up essentially during puberty because the neurons of the hypothalamus are responsive to these hormones that are coming from the gonads and in females it's yes mainly secretion of estrogen but also testosterone okay so the brain is changing in dramatic ways not the least of which is the forbrain is learning how to suppress impulse okay and some of that gets feedback from behaviors from parenting how topress learning how to supress from social reward or punishment if it doesn't get daily practice in suppressing if you're able to give into all your urges cuz like I'm finding like when I sit at my computer my Rule now I have to say to myself out loud finish what you start finish what you start no don't go check until you've done you only have two more pages to read read those two pages but I I can't do it right well this is the gradual creep of sort of a we don't want to make it clinical but an adult like ADHD like symptoms that we all are suffering from right there's just it's just we're at a buffet right and delicious that's a good example so um that's one of the main things this uh forbrain to hypothalamic wiring the other is and is this not trivial and you mentioned in the context of language learning and Dr Eddie changen who's a neurosurgeon uh actually chair of neuros surgery at UCSF knows a lot about this and critical periods is that their hormone effects on say like thickening of the vocal cords which is why on average boys have um deeper voices than girls and so forth after puberty and there's a lot of feedback from those signals in terms of the social world because now a young boy whose voice deepens who's also acquiring more knowledge is talking to other people about that knowledge and he's being treated differently and there's feedback in terms of his self-concept and that's where it gets kind of high level abstract in girls there's feedback of sometimes it's bodily changes positive or negative feedback from peers other girls Andor boys but also knowledge she's out there talking about well you know like she's brilliant in math or you know brilliant in literature and getting the feedback and then self- knowledge starts to accumulate and the the location of identity in the brain is unclear it's probably distributed Network it's probably an emergent property of a lot of different things so we can't really point to one area but it's learning impulse control reinforcement contingencies on what time scale can I get what I want to meet certain drives and to what extent should I suppress those drives and you know traditionally it was I think through religion and parenting and um social cues that you will learn well if I want something is it okay to do it that there are consequences to eating more or less consequences to be okay so it's super complex but but that all happens sometimes in a summer this is what's so amazing to about puberty to me you know or the acquisition of facial hair in in a boy you know suddenly he's looked at differently people will start projecting all sorts of Futures on him you know um but we do this I notice I'm not a child psychologist obviously but as soon as my niece started drawing she's going to be an artist as soon as a boy starts building or a girl starts you know gets a math problem right is going to be a a mathematician I mean we project all this stuff and and there's no question that that feeds back on identity but in terms of online use I can't even imagine how much of this is diminished by only showing a specific part of ourselves and I can't even imagine how much of it is exacerbated in terms of what we are rewarded for during puberty so here's what we know in both animals and humans which is that neuroplasticity while it responds to punishment is exquisitely sensitive become sort of a runaway train for more plasticity under conditions of dopamine reinforcement and reward so you can imagine that the girl using the filter the Instagram filter for who gets rewarded for looking a certain way maybe excessively thin or something or what leads to excessively thin um there's no question that rewards Drive neuroplasticity faster than punishment make sure I understand this you're saying suppose a girl gets uh a girl gets onto Instagram and she's now consuming stuff about being thin and for some reason she finds this rewarding are you saying that the the the quick dopamine circuits or she posts something and she gets likes for it are you saying that that actually will extend neuroplasticity the fact that she's getting more dopamine s rapid dopamine that will make her more neuroplastic and her brain will change more yes it will it will accelerate learning for the whatever contingency led to that whatever led to that so we know this in animals and humans even though they're exquisitly sensitive plasticity is exquisitely sensitive to punishment you know it only takes one shock learning in one corner of a cage or getting sick at one particular restaurant that you don't want to go back again but when it comes to social dynamics we know that reward leads to almost what I would call runaway plasticity in the circuits that generated the behaviors that led to that particular reward I mean it's um and there are a number of experiments that that explain this the work of Mike merenik at UCSF who largely worked on adult plasticity but showed that when you when you activate dopamine release in the brain fortunately both during development but also in adulthood you essentially create a window of super plasticity okay that's dopamine reward that neuromodulator is a window for super plasticity and evolutionarily it makes sense like oh my goodness there's there's abundance here of something oh time to learn something new that's right we've we've overemphasized the extent to which plasticity is driven by punishment but the the neuromodulators that allow for plasticity in particular in puberty and as adults are largely dopamine dependent and acetylcholine dependent um the acetylcholine generally increases Focus um broadly speaking I mean does a bunch of other things controls muscular contraction Etc but so what we're basically saying here is that if a kid gets a strongly reinforcing experience I I'd be willing to bet both arms that the neural circuits that help generate whatever behaviors led to that experience are going to be strengthened in one trial to the extent that it will be very easy to generate those those behaviors again okay so this okay thank"}
{"question": "What are some common blind spots that people with high cognitive abilities tend to overlook, and how can recognizing and overcoming these blind spots lead to personal growth and improvement?", "doc_id": "3gtvNYa3Nd8_17", "video_id": "3gtvNYa3Nd8", "video_title": "Dr. Adam Grant: How to Unlock Your Potential, Motivation & Unique Abilities", "video_header": "Tool: Bias

perhaps also explain how how they can limit us and if you have any examples that um from the research where um people overcoming their blind spots has benefited them that would be amazing yeah wow there's a lot there let me well let me start by saying I think a lot of people think about blind spots in terms of hereis ICS and biases so you think about confirmation bias you think about the the classic Conan tersi work uh that ended up winning Dan a Nobel Prize on um you know the the way in which um you know our intuitive judgments um often get anchored in the way we've done things before um or you know we focus on the information that's sellan and available to us and Overlook you know less obvious information I've come to think that the the mother of all biases is uh what I what I think of is the I'm not biased bias um it's it's technically called the bias blind spot in Emily pronin and colleagues research but the idea is that I think I'm more objective than other people and you may have your you may have flaws in your thinking Andrew but me like I I see things clearly and rationally and I think that this is a it's a really dangerous meta bias because the moment you believe you're not biased you are incapable of seeing any of your biases um so in some of the research on the bias blind spot you see that um that people who have um who score high in cognitive ability tests so you know high IQ are actually more likely to fall victim to the I'm not bias bias because they've been reinforced for a lifetime uh that they're really smart and they're good at thinking oh goodness this explains some uh we don't talk about current events on this podcast much but this explain some current events uh people that were told their entire careers that they are perfect or near perfect and um uh yeah circumstances eventually came to you know slam them hard into the concrete on that one or or in some cases it hasn't happened yet but we we watch them hurdling toward Earth um so I I worry a lot about that so I think the beginning of you know of seeing any blind spot is recognizing that we all have blind spots it's part of Being Human um I think that the brighter side of that is that we're not just blind to weaknesses we're also blind to our strengths um so Jane Dutton and Laura Morgan Roberts and colleagues uh did some research on the reflected best self-portrait this is one of my favorite exercises to do in the classroom but also to do in workplaces sometimes even people end up doing it with their kids at home the idea is that you know you do have strengths that you're not that aware of uh they may be things that come naturally to you that you don't even realize are hard for other people they may be things that are struggles for you um and so you you think it's hard to do and therefore I'm bad at it but other people watch you do it and realize you're actually quite good at it so the you need other people to hold up a mirror to see what these invisible strengths are so the way the flect a best self Exercise Works is you're asked to contact 10 to 20 people who know you well in different walks of life might be a family member a couple friends some colleagues and then you ask them to tell a story about a time when you were at your best and you collect these stories it's it's the most exciting week of email you will ever get 20 notes let me tell you how great you are but what's key this goes back to our discussion of feedback earlier is they're really specific about a moment when you are at your best and then your job is to collect all the stories and do the pattern recognition exercise and ask what are the common themes that I've seen through these stories and it's a it's a really powerful and Vivid way of of getting a sense of what are those strengths and um you know it's not surprising that in some of the research when people go through this process um they end up with much more clarity not only about what they're what they're good at and where their potential lies but also how do I like what do those situations have in common where I was able to use my strengths and how do I get myself in those situations more often how do I create those situations more often um I I'll give you a personal example on this so I I got a bunch of feedback that uh I was good at helping other people see their strengths and I thought okay I don't feel like I have enough opportunities to use that strength in my daily life so what am I going to do about this and I ended up flipping the exercise upside down and I picked a 100 people who um really mattered to me and I wrote a story to each of them about a time when they were at their best and I'm like there's there's no reason I can't I can't make this part of my day um it's probably it was it was probably one of the best weeks of My Life um it was better than getting the stories was was giving them uh and I got these notes back from people saying you know I I didn't realize I don't even remember that thing that happened um but I think for me it was an example of saying okay um you know I've I've always enjoyed um trying to bring out the best in others uh I don't feel like at the time I was a I was a first year doctoral student I didn't feel like I had anything to contribute to others I'm try I'm trying to learn how to you know understand this field and you know do a worthwhile study and write a paper I'm not teaching yet I have no value to add and getting this feedback like oh you're somebody who helps other people see their potential I'm like all right let me let me take some people that I you know I already recognize um really amazing things in and let me just tell them that uh and it took me about a week to write the the 100 emails and um I can't think of a a week I've spent better wow it's so interesting that you flipped the process on its head a bit um or a lot and that ended up being the reward do you think you learned anything"}
{"question": "How do the shape of our ears and the way we position them affect our ability to localize sounds in space?", "doc_id": "JVRyzYB9JSY_5", "video_id": "JVRyzYB9JSY", "video_title": "The Science of Hearing, Balance & Accelerated Learning", "video_header": "Localizing Sounds", "segment_idx": "5", "time_start": "23:48", "time_end": "27:59", "context": "what you're hearing, you need to know where it's coming from. It's vital to our survival, that if something, for instance, is falling toward us, that we know if it's coming to our right side, if it's going to hit us from behind, we have to know, for instance, if a car is coming at us from our left or from our right. And our visual system can help with that. But our auditory and our visual system collaborate to help us find and locate the position of things in space. That should come as no surprise. If you hear somebody talking off to your right, you tend to turn to your right, not to your left. If you see somebody's mouth moving in front of you, you tend to assume that the sound is going to come from right in front of you. Disruptions in this auditory hearing and visual matching are actually the basis of what's called the ventriloquism effect, which we'll talk about in a few minutes in more depth. But the ventriloquism effect can basically be described in simple terms as when you essentially think that a sound is coming from a location that it's not actually coming from. We'll talk about that in a moment but what I'd like you to realize is that one of these stations, deep in your brainstem is responsible for helping you identify where sounds are coming from through a process that's called interaural time differences. And that sounds fancy, but really, the way you know where things are coming from, what direction a car or a boss or a person is coming from is because the sound lands in one ear before the other. And you have stations in your brain, meaning you have neurons in your brain that calculate the difference in time of arrival for those sound waves in your right versus your left ear. And if they arrive at the same time, you assume that thing is making noise right in front of you. If it's off to your right, you assume it's over on your right. And if the sound arrives first to your left ear, you assume, quite correctly, that the thing is coming toward your left ear. So it's a very simple and mechanical system at the level of sound localization. But what about up and down? If you think about it, a sound coming from above is going to land on your right ear and your left ear at the same time. A sound from below is going to land on your right ear and your left ear at the same time. So the way that we know where things are in terms of what's called elevation, where they are in the up and down plane is by the frequencies. The shape of your ears actually modifies the sound depending on whether or not it's coming straight at you, from the floor or from high above. And so already at the level of your ears, you are taking information about the outside world and determining where that information is coming from. Now, this all happens very, very fast and it's subconscious but now you know why if people really want to hear something, they make a cup around their ear. They essentially make their ear into more of a fennec fox type ear. If you've ever seen those cute little fennec fox things, they have these big spiky ears, they look like a French bulldog, although the fox version version of the French bulldog. This big, tall ears, and they have excellent sound localization. And so when people lean in with their ear, with their hand like this, if you're listening to this, I'm just cupping my hand at my ear, I'm giving myself a bigger pinna. And if I do it on the left side, I can do this side. And if I really want to hear something, I do it on both sides. So this isn't just gesturing, this actually serves a mechanical role. And actually, if you want to hear where things are coming from with a much greater degree of accuracy, this can actually help because you're capturing sound waves and funneling them better. It's really remarkable, this whole system. So you've got these two ears and because of the differences in the timing of when things arrive in those two ears, as well as these differences in the frequencies that certain things sound, or I should say the differences in the frequencies that arrive at your ears, depending on whether or not the thing is above you or right in front of you or below you, you're able to make out where things are in space pretty well. So now you're probably starting to realize"}

and I get a lot of questions is what can be done to improve confidence you know and I've thought a lot about that question and you know what is confidence in the context of what we're talking about now is one reasonable definition of confidence our ability to trust our predispositions and our potentialities enough that were we to encounter scenarios A through Z we feel pretty good that we would respond the right way in a way that um wouldn't threaten our conscious mind at a core level right you know that that we wouldn't um I I used to use the term and and joke a lot in my laboratory uh with the the phrase you know dissolve into a puddle of our own tears right it's kind of this like hyperbolic explanation of of what I think many people fear like they're going to be called upon to answer a question publicly or give a speech or they're going to be at a critical moment in a relationship or something and there and just everything is just going to go so badly wrong that it's just going to dissolve them as a person it's impossible right dissolve in a ble of our own tears is impossible but I think that's a fear that a lot of people live with because we can get into this a little bit later and we will I'm sure you know this notion of like protecting one's ego is seems really vital to to being a human being some level like we don't we don't want to dissolve into a puddle of our own tears so is confidence the ability to trust ourselves in a bunch of different contexts um and at the same time I I do have to raise the this notion of narcissism I think um uh you know this word gets thrown around a lot lately but it seems to me that any um truly psychologically healthy person would also not want to be the idiot that thinks that they're better than they actually are that's a um what are your thoughts on this well I agree with the things that you that you said about confidence except I would add two factors that I think are like really big big factors right right one being State dependence and the other being phenomenology right so think about the state dependence first right when we're talking about confidence it's it's not uniform right or it's not automatically uniform right so if so if you were to tell me oh oh I lack confidence right then I I want to understand is that across the board is like is that a way that you feel about yourself that like I I'm not good enough at anything for example right or do you lack confidence in a specific area right and this is often the case right and it's it's a huge difference right it says that person has the Machinery of confidence so to speak right they have the potentialities and the predispositions for confidence right when that character structure this self-built upon it is engaging with the world right but they're not able to bring it to bear in certain in a certain special situation so to speak so for some people for example the way we most often see this is like the carve out of romance right where because it's so emotionally Laden right and like rejection can feel so bad right that we can see people who are very confident in many many aspects of life but they are very defent about romance and they'll say oh it never works out for me or no one will ever like me right and and you see like that's not how that person actually feels right about themselves as a whole human being right which which which is then we are coming at how to make that better in a way that's very robust right we might say something like hey here's the good news is you have the tools and the Machinery that you need right you're confident in so many ways right in fact maybe in all ways except this one so let's go take a look at like why is that special right and then and that where are we we're back to is it something in the unconscious mind is it something in the in the conscious mind but how that person is engaging right so we have to understand what the state is and if the lack of confidence is State dependent if the person is not confident across the board then again we go back to the same we always go back to the same places to look right but then you might more think okay is is there an impact of childhood trauma or early life trauma that that took away from that person you know the their ability to to gain confidence right because if you have no confidence across the board there's a deeper problem right because there would be this something anyone can be good about at and feel confident in right so the state dependence is very important as is phenomenology so what is your experience of being confident if you tell me well I'm let's say in a different version of this example you say you know actually I'm I'm quite I feel quite confident when I when I walk into a room of of people I say okay I want to understand more about that too right because if I ask questions about that and you say well I feel confident because you know look I'm I'm a pretty smart person I can think on my feet I can I can deal well with with people if something doesn't go right I can recover from it like I've got you know it's why I feel confident you know and say okay that sounds pretty good if you say well I feel confident because I know that I'm better than than everybody right now we have a problem right right like that's not going to go well in other you know in other uh aspects of life and engagement like there's you know it's not going to lead to humility and gratitude like so so where's that coming from and again maybe there's a deeper problem right s about narcissism right which can be a a a reaction right which is a reaction to vulnerability right so then there's was called a reaction formation and now the person uh is actually deeply diffident right but present is very very confident and with a sense of superiority and that that's not a recipe for for happiness right so so in the in approaching it we we do want to understand all the things that you said what are the factors and the the set of predispositions and the set of potentialities but then what's the real world experience of that across situations and what is the person's experience of that inside which is why if we're going to understand and help people like that's the understand part right you know it's why the conveyor belt medicine you know doesn't work right in situations where we're dealing with human beings like mental health right we have to understand something about people to understand whatever they're telling us means otherwise you have no context so you have no knowledge another very common set of questions"}

the uh nerds call them nerds like me call them little fenestrations little holes down into the enamel that if they make it down to the Dentin layer of the tooth most likely do need to be drilled and filled and presumably build okay but your goal I think all of our goal is to try and keep our teeth in a state of remineralization by keeping the pH that is the relative acid alkaline balance of the mouth such that the saliva supports remineralization now let's think about how a cavity actually forms turns out that no specific food not even sugar causes cavities cavities are not caused by sugar cavities are caused by bacteria that feed on sugar and now that's not just a little bit of a Twist in the mechanism that's a critical point there's no specific food not even pure sugar not even like a hard candy like a delicious Jolly Rancher I used to like those when I was a kid they get stuck in your tooth that causes cavities no it's the bacteria that feed on sugar that then produce acid that burrows down through that degrades that demineralizes the tooth in this very focal area that we call a cavity okay now if that isn't surprising enough get this the bacteria that causes cavities by eating sugar and releasing this acid while there are several of them the major one is called streptococus mutans or what I'll call strep mutans for short strep mutans is not something you're born with it's actually a communicable bacteria that's right you give it to one another through how sharing of glasses sharing of bottles kissing on the mouth Etc now I am not here to tell you not not to do any of those things I'm certainly not here to tell you that however and by the way in researching this episode I did learn that there is a specific category of person out there typically they are a dentist or married to a dentist that have opted believe it or not to never kiss their children near or on the mouth so as to help their children not get streptococus mutans because almost all adults carry it not all but it's communicable like a STI or like a flu or like a it's communicated between individuals we are not born with it now that's a whole area of U let's just call it biosocial ethics decision-making that I think most people are not going to be too concerned with or at least act on because let's face it most people are not going to change their overall behavior of kissing or usage of bottles or glasses in order to avoid getting strep mutans most people in the world have strep mutans or will get strep mutans and it lives in the mouth okay it just resides there strep mutans is there and it's hungry what's it hungry for sugar when there's sugar present it eats it it produces acid the acid produces cavities taking teeth from a state of remineralization to demineralization or and by the way this is really important if your mouth is already in a state that's more demineralization mode so to speak well then it will capitalize on that and it will cause cavities much faster okay so keep in mind that acidity is bad for the mouth does that mean that you should never consume a lemon or and by the way yes I'm guilty of everyone a while chew a lemon slice or drinking water with lemon in it or carbonated drinks or sodas or tea or anything that has acidic flavor no likewise should you completely avoid ingesting any kind of sugar because strep mutans love sugar no turns out strep mutans like sugars in the form of complex carbohydrate sugars too so if you eat pasta or rice or oatmeal and some bread every once in a while as I do I'm an omnivore I eat meat and fish and eggs and also starches and vegetables and fruits I'm an omnivore as most people are well then strep mutans has an opportunity to eat the sugars that come from those other carbohydrates does that mean that if you were to have a zero carbohydrate diet no sugars no starches Etc you would reduce the opportunity for strep mutans to consume sugar and release acid maybe maybe however most people won't do that and strep mutans is a very clever maybe even diabolical bacteria and if you are on a zero carbohydrate zero sugar diet there's some evidence that strep mutans will figure out ways to feed on other components of food in order to create this acid to then create cavities in your teeth so the key thing to understand here is that cavities form form not from foods not from sugars per se but from strep mutans and other bacteria that eat those sugars and create acid hence the critical need to keep your mouth as alkaline as possible which does not mean that you can never drink some lemon water or coffee or tea here's the key point that everyone needs to remember because this dovetails beautifully into how often you should brush and floss and when you should brush and floss specifically the key point is the degree to which your mouth is in a demon state or a remin state and the degree to which cavities have the opportunity to form is dependent on the amount of time the amount of time in which your mouth is net acidic or net alkaline the amount of time that you are in a demineralization mode or remineralization mode okay so it's the amount of time no one no one can avoid having their mouth be acidic every once in a while or ingesting a sugar or a food that strep mut mutans can feed on and produce acid the key is to try and reduce the amount of strep mutans and reduce the amount of acid in the mouth that's the best way to reduce cavities and even reverse cavities that have started to form now in a moment I'm"}
{"question": "What inspired you to pursue a career in neuroscience and psychiatry after initially being drawn to poetry and medicine?", "doc_id": "w9MXqXBZy9U_9", "video_id": "w9MXqXBZy9U", "video_title": "Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Understanding & Healing the Mind", "video_header": "Why Karl Became a Scientist", "segment_idx": "9", "time_start": "42:00", "time_end": "47:09", "context": "did you decide to become a scientist to find cures for mental disease? - No, I didn't. It's a really important question to actually look back and see the steps that brought you to a particular place. And that was not what brought me initially to science and it's okay I think, to embrace the twists and turns that life brings to you, but I was always interested in the brain. And so, that was something that for me started from a very early age. We talked about being introspective. I noticed very early on I had a deep love of poetry and stories, and I was a voracious reader, and I was amazed by how words could make me feel in particular ways. Even separate from their, of course, dictionary meanings, the rhythm, and how they work together, even separate from meaning. And I was stunned by poets that could use words in new ways that were even divorced from their meaning at all, and yet could still trigger specific emotions. And this was always fascinating to me. So, I wanted to understand that, and so I was interested and I became interested in the brain and I thought, well, I'm going to to have to study the human brain, because only human beings can describe what's going on inside enough. So in college, I began to steer myself toward medicine, with the idea of becoming a neurosurgeon. And so I came here to medical school, and did an MD PhD program, planning neurosurgery all the way through. The first rotation I did at the end of medical school, as you know, you do rotations, you go through different specialties, and some of these are required rotations, everybody has to do this summary elective where you can pick what you want to do. I elected to do the neurosurgery first, even before regular surgery. I was that sure I wanted to do it, and I loved it. I had a fantastic time. There was an amazing patient who had a thalamic damage, and there was a neglect syndrome where the patient was not able to be aware of something that was right in front of him- - Even though their vision was perfectly fine? - Even though their vision was perfectly fine, exactly. And I loved the operating room, I loved the rhythm of suturing and the precision of it, and I loved being able to help patients immediately, but then a required rotation was in psychiatry, which I was not looking forward to at all. And that completely reset my whole life, that experience in psychiatry. And it was at that moment that I saw this is first of all, the greatest need, the depth of suffering and the depth of the mystery together. And also it was, I almost feel a little guilty about this. It's so interesting too. Yes, we can help. Yes, there's need, but as a scientist, this is amazing, that someone's reality can be different from my own, with everything physically, as far as we can tell the same with the measures we have, and yet we've got a different reality. That is an amazing thing, and if we can understand that and help these people, that would be just more than anybody could ask for. And so that's how I ended up taking this path, just a required rotation in psychiatry. - It all started with poetry? - And it started with poetry. - Out of respect for poetry, are there any favorites that you spend time with on a regular basis? - I mean, the ones who got me down this path early on, I remember in childhood and high school, Borges had an immense influence on me. I studied Spanish all the way through and reading his work. He was a great writer. He wrote both in English and in Spanish and being able to appreciate his poetry both in English and in Spanish was a pretty amazing thing. Not many poets can do that. - You're bilingual? - I'm not, I wouldn't say. Now I became, at one point I was effectively fluent in Spanish, and I'm pretty good with medical Spanish still because we use Spanish all the time in the clinic here. I wouldn't claim full fluency, but it's something I can definitely use all the time. And that's been very helpful in the clinic. - Yeah, Borges is wonderful. As the son of an Argentine, I grew up hearing about it and I learned that Borges' favorite city was Geneva. So I spent time in Geneva only for that reason. It's also turns out to be an interesting city. - Yes. - So you developed methods to control neurons with these algae proteins using light? - Yeah. - In 2015, there was what I thought was a very nice article"}

wanted to go to the Naval Academy um during World War II and he lied to the recruiter and got into the merchant marines his I'm pretty sure first cousin my uncle and my cousins are like first cousins once REM removed my Uncle Jim THL was at a family reunion in Mississippi which we were at and he didn't mention to Naval Academy family reunion ends they all go home and he starts sending me Naval Academy paraphernalia I knew nothing about the military and I just thought about it you know and he would send me stuff you know you didn't we didn't have the internet right you sending these booklets and you don't like Authority no so I I've not been in the military but I've done some work with yall and um there's a there's a lot of uh hierarchy and Authority yeah that's true it it the truth and was like it was just it just seemed exciting I wasn't really thinking about the implications as 18-year-olds you know it looked very exciting to me and having gotten some professional help in the intervening years what I really think was a big part of it was my parents got divorced my senior year in high school and the family unit just blew up right and so it also represented an escape you know get out and go get your life out of the New Orleans and just go just go do something were you a part of that uh that obviously you were part of the family that got divorced was it chaotic was it uh controlled you and I are the exact same age we're both 48 born in 75 um back then it was a lot less common for um people being they called them broken homes back then yeah you know um nowadays I don't think they call that everyone just cites the statistic that you know more than half of marriages end in in divorce as if it perhaps to normalize it um but that's more than half um do you recall feeling um distraught about that or was it just kind of the natural consequence of something you had observed a long time like oh that kind of makes sense that no it was a shock to me it wasn't shock to my older sister um I just remember com this was the thought at the time I this is like seared in my brain this has nothing to do with me that wasn't like some sophisticated view it was mostly this I'm not dealing with this I have my own life they're going to have to do what they're going to do meaning my parents I'm getting the hell out of here not a bad mindset for a kid at that stage if it had been four years younger that might not be the the best mindset but as you're heading off to college that's reasonably healthy mindset as opposed to getting am mesed in the what happened in and this and that can I ask you at at that stage you're 17 18 years old at that point um were you journaling at that point no no no journaling no introspective work zero no school psychologist no no thinking about or talking about your feelings it's wrestling Naval Academy social things School SATs like like very standard we're almost like talking like a superficial list of like what happens at the end of high school in 1992 Andrew it's a the the word superficial and I carried this forward for years which I'm sure we'll talk about here in a second those binary Focus areas like I was literally just going after them at Full Steam Stronger Faster more intensity with zero introspection no excavation of the of the psychology of anything just full steam ahead like let's go no meditation no breath work zero which was not adaptive in the long run and we we'll get to uh how that played out in the long run but nonetheless um you got into the Naval Academy well didn't first okay so I applied I I get you know my uncle's doing all this stuff anyway I applied and I didn't I still have the letter the thanks but no thanks you know you're not qualified how'd that hit you at the time it hit me kind of like everything I did when that age when it didn't work out it admittedly Andrew it was it was like there's got to be a way around this like has to work out but it but it feels terrible right like it you have a moment of what do we do and my kids have heard the story a million times my wife was a blue chip swimming recruit for a navy and so she was into the Naval Academy when she was at the beginning of her senior year of high school right what's a blue chip I I mean in my understanding a blue chip is like you are at the very top of the list and the coaches put you straight into the admission cycle saying nobody else gets in until this person does so they wanted her they didn't want you I Not only was she a blue chip and I was and I got the no um I guess well the wrestling coach called me a couple of weeks after my no which is now in may I'm about to graduate from high school I'm not accepted anywhere you only applied one place actually to which you may bur bust out laughing when I tell you what the other one is because no internet I got a mailer in a pamplet from Stanford the wrestling coach I didn't know what Stanford was I had no idea that the college was even prestigious I didn't know they had a wrestling team I filled out the application and wrote the letter thing and I sent it into Stanford and of course never heard back from them but I applied to two places Stanford and the US Naval Academy well for those that follow wrestling I'm I get into either right uh that's a great story and I'll just briefly mention that a few years ago there almost wasn't a wrestling team at Stanford they uh had plans to cut the wrestling team despite having a NCAA champion at Stanford but you know the power of people Gathering and and petitioning works and um wrestling and a few other sports that were being cut from the curriculum um were spared it's amazing yeah rescued so happy to see that yeah so that so it Stanford does have a wrestling team so the coach the coach back to like how I ended up getting in I appreciated my my college coach called and he said there I'm recruiting I have one more spot at the prep school which is in Newport Rhode Island I'm recruiting another kid from Pennsylvania if he takes that spot then I don't have anything left and we were exploring going to prep school and stuff like that oblique ways to get in and he called me sometime in May like right around graduation and said can you be in Newport in July that kid went to I think he went to Lehi and I I went to the prep school so Newport Rhode Island yeah in Newport for a year and been there it's a nice place yeah it's great yeah and so you wrestle for I mean you do school you know you're you're in West Point has a prep school and Colorado Springs has a prep school and so we joke that my wife was first person in our class accepted and I was last which is highly possible actually I'd like to take a brief break"}

There's a good chance that nightmares are occurring slow wave sleep. There are actually some drugs that I don't suggest people take. In fact so much so I'm not gonna mention them that give people very kind of scary or eerie dreams and this kind of feeling that things are pursuing them, or that they can't move when they are being chased. That's actually a common dream that I've had. I guess, it's more or less a nightmare. The feeling that one is paralyzed and can't move and is being chased. A lot of people have said, \"Oh, that must be in REM sleep.\" Because you're paralyzed and so you're dreaming about being paralyzed and you can't move. I think that's probably false. The research says that because no epinephrine is absent during REM sleep, it's very unlikely that you can have these intense, fearful memories. So those are probably occurring in slow wave sleep. Although, there might be instances where people have nightmares in REM sleep. The other thing is some people experience, certainly I've had this experience, of waking up and feeling very stressed about whatever it was that I happen to be thinking about,"}
{"question": "How does the mechanical stimulation of the gut, such as distension, trigger the brain's response to stop eating or vomiting?", "doc_id": "15R2pMqU2ok_10", "video_id": "15R2pMqU2ok", "video_title": "How to Enhance Your Gut Microbiome for Brain & Overall Health", "video_header": "Mechanical Cues from Gut to Brain", "segment_idx": "10", "time_start": "44:47", "time_end": "49:00", "context": "So we've largely been talking about chemical communication between the gut and the brain. Chemical because even though these neuropod cells are communicating with the brain by way of electrical activity, what we call action potentials, and in neural language we call those spikes, spikes of action potentials, spikes of action potentials, meaning those neural signals, cause the release of chemicals in the brain like dopamine. So it's chemical transmission. Similarly, hormones, even though they act more slowly, hormones like neuropeptide Y like CCK, like ghrelin, they are signaling chemically. They're moving through the body, they're going in there affecting the chemical output of different cells, and they're changing the chemistry of those cells and the chemistry of the cells that those cells talk to. So that gives us one particular category of signaling from gut to brain, which is chemical signaling. But of course there are other forms of signals and those fall under the category of mechanical signaling. You're probably familiar with this. If you've ever eaten a very large meal or consumed a lot of fluid, you experience that as distension of the gut and that doesn't just have to be distension of the stomach, but distension of your intestines as well. That distension is registered by neurons that reside in your gut, the signals go up to your brain, and communicate with areas of the brain that are responsible for suppressing further consumption of food and/or fluid, and, under certain circumstances, can also be associated with the activation of neural circuits that cause vomiting or the desire to vomit. So if ever you've eaten too much or you've eaten something that doesn't agree with you, that information is communicated by way of mechanosensors that sense the mechanics of your gut, possibly also the chemistry of your gut, but mostly the mechanics of your gut, signal up to the brain, and activate brain centers that are involved in stopping the eating behavior, and activation of an area of the brain stem that is affectionately referred to as the vomit center among neuroanatomists. This is a area that more appropriately is called the chemoreceptor trigger zone, the CTZ, or area postrema and neurons in this area actually will trigger the vomiting reflex. So the way that the gut and the brain communicate is both chemical and mechanical, and it can be both for sake of increasing certain types of behavior. Today, we're talking mainly about feeding behavior up until now anyway but also ceasing to eat, closing your mouth, moving away from food, turning away from food, all behaviors that we're familiar with anytime we feel kind of sick on the basis of activation of this mechanosensor for gastric distress. So we've got chemical signaling and mechanical signaling. And I also want to emphasize that we have direct and indirect signaling from the gut to the brain. Direct signaling is the kind of signaling of the sort I've been talking about mainly up until now, which is neurons in the gut communicating with neurons in the brain stem that communicate with neurons in the hypothalamus. And, of course, those are also going to interact with neurons of the prefrontal cortex which is the area of a brain involved in decision making the, you know, I think it was the shrimp that made me sick. I'm going to, I just don't want any more of that. Or I'm never going back to that restaurant again because after I ate there about an hour later, I started feeling really not well. I felt, you know, kind of feverish, but my gut didn't feel well, my digestion was really off. All of that kind of information is handled in the prefrontal cortex at a conscious level, but the immediate decision to stop eating or to eat more of something to move towards something or away from it, that's made by neural circuits that reside at the, we would say, the subconscious level but what we really mean is below the level of the neocortex. Below the cortex means essentially below our level of conscious awareness. So we talked about two types of information within the gut that are communicated to the brain, chemical information, meaning information about the nutrients that happen to be there, and mechanical information, distention of the gut or lack of distention and so forth. And we talked about how these neuropod cells can signal the release of dopamine and circuits within the brain to cause you to seek out more of something. Now, in a very logically consistent way, dopamine is also involved in the whole business of vomiting."}

{"question": "What are some optimal physical and environmental settings that can help increase focus and alertness during 90-minute work blocks, and how can these settings be tailored to individual needs?", "doc_id": "aXvDEmo6uS4_11", "video_id": "aXvDEmo6uS4", "video_title": "Maximizing Productivity, Physical & Mental Health with Daily Tools", "video_header": "Protocol 7: Optimize Deep Work: Visual Elevation, Ultradian Cycles, White Noise", "segment_idx": "11", "time_start": "37:32", "time_end": "48:26", "context": "'Cause I'm not just sitting there thinking about all the GLP-1 circulating in my system. I'm working. A couple of things for optimizing workspace that are grounded in neuroscience and physiology. I've talked before about the fact that when our eyes are directed upward, literally when our eyelids are open, no surprise there, and when our eyes are directed upward, it creates a state of heightened alertness. And this has a relationship to the brainstem neurons that create alertness and their control over the muscles of the eye and, believe it or not, the eyelids. Now, it's not the case that if you are absolutely exhausted and you need to feel more alert that looking upward is going to make you feel wide awake, although it will help support your levels of alertness. The point here is that you can optimize your workstation in a physical way that leverages this aspect of the visual system and your level of alertness. Since most of us want to be awake while we're working, try and position your screen or your tablet, whatever device you happen to be working on, at least at eye level and ideally slightly higher. Now, if you think about it, most people are not doing this. Most people are looking down at their computer or tablet or are angling their eyes at their screen at about 30 degrees. That is not going to support heightened states of alertness and optimal attention. In fact, the opposite relationship between eye position and alertness is also true. When we look down, when our eyelids are slightly closed, it tends to decrease our levels of alertness and increase our levels of sleepiness. I really want to emphasize this, that there's a bi-directional or reciprocal relationship between the brainstem areas that control alertness and the eyes, meaning how alert you are controls how open or closed your eyes are, no surprise there, but also the how open and upward directed your eyes are will increase your levels of alertness And if your eyes are pointed downward and your eyelids are hooded, like they're slowly closing, like Costello's are always are, you'll feel more sleepy, especially if you're somebody who tends to have that mid-morning sleepiness or mid-morning crash. So what I do is I have a standing desk, but I also prop the computer up such that it's at least at eye level. And I haven't figured out yet how to develop a workstation where the computer is above me. I think the only way to really do that is actually to tilt one's body back, but actually that's not a good idea either. They have done studies recording from areas of the brain associated with alertness. Areas like locus coeruleus in the so-called reticular activating system. What they found is that depending on how reclined you are or upright you are, you will decrease with reclining and increase with sitting forward your levels of alertness. So body posture and whether or not your upright or reclining will impact your levels of alertness in the predictable ways. And where you position your eyes, whether or not your eyes are upright, so to speak, looking up or directly forward or looking down, will dictate whether or not you are feeling more alert or more sleepy, respectively. So try and arrange a workstation or a position of your body in your chair or your standing desk, whatever it is, that allows you to work with a heightened state of alertness. This is really, really key for me because I found that when I would sit down, not only would my hip flexors start to get sore, I feel tight in the back, et cetera, but if I was staring down at my screen all day or even for short periods of the day, I would start to feel sleepy and I couldn't figure out what was going on. I also thought maybe I needed glasses. I do wear readers at night, but it was really a problem. And simply by getting the screen directly in front of me at eye level, it's been completely transformative. So we're now at the description of my day in these protocols in which I would do a 90-minute about of work. Now, why 90 minutes? Well, the brain is going through these 90 minutes so-called \"ultradian cycles\" throughout the entire day and night. Every 90 minutes, we shift over from being very alert to being less alert, and then back to alert again. Here's how it works. At the start of one of these 90 minute ultradian cycles, my brain is not quite engaged in whatever it is I'm trying to do. Oftentimes I have things jumping into my mind, I've got distractions, et cetera. I'll talk about how to deal with those distractions in a moment. But I set a timer for 90 minutes and I try and get a strong about of work done inside of that 90 minutes with the full understanding that the entire 90 minutes is not going to be uniform in terms of my ability to focus. There will be kind of peaks and valleys within that, but that 90 minutes is about what the brain can handle in terms of a dedicated effort for high degree of focus. Some people can push out a little bit further, some people can't handle more than 10 minutes, but that's what I'm striving toward. You'd be amazed how much you can get done in 90 minutes if you are focused. So how do you increase that focus and how do you use the timer feature? Well, you can combine those. I use a program called Freedom. It shuts me out of the internet completely. So that means no checking the markets, no checking social media, no checking, you know, the news, no checking email, none of that. I get a dedicated about of work done. I confess, I don't allow myself to go to the restroom in that period of time. Here's an interesting little tip that's grounded in physiology. You have a direct neural connection from your bladder to your brainstem areas that increase alertness. This is why when you have to go to the bathroom, when you have to urinate, it is extremely agitating, right? It can be very, very agitating. I'm not encouraging you to get so agitated by filling your bladder so much and resisting going to the bathroom that you are uncomfortable and can't focus, but I generally will just drink liquids and work away and work away, and I won't walk away to go use the bathroom unless I absolutely have to. Sort of odd that we're talking about this, but this is one way in which I've learned to funnel my attention into whatever it is I'm doing. Because as you all know, the moment you sit down to do some serious work and you flip off the internet, all of a sudden it's as if the phone has a voice, it starts calling you.. It's almost as if the restroom has a voice. But we all are familiar with the fact that if we are focused on something that all that just kind of melts away. So the goal is to get into what I call the tunnel, to really get into a tunnel of quality work. The brain loves that state, but it's very hard for many of us to access. My phone is absolutely off. It's not on airplane mode. It's absolutely off during this time. If I've been struggling with that and, I confess, you know, there are times when, for whatever reason, something going on in life, it's been harder to put away the phone. I will sometimes put it in my car. I used to joke that I used to throw it up on the roof or something like that. Look, I've done and I suggest people do whatever they need to in order to self-regulate that activity. And if you're somebody that feels that you absolutely need to be on your phone and on the computer for this work about or the work that you do, well, that's a different matter altogether. This is just simply how I work. So I will do 90 minutes and I do set a timer and I turn on the program, Freedom locks me out of the internet. If someone rings the doorbell, I will often shout, \"Not coming to the doorbell. Leave it there.\" I mean, unless there's a real emergency, I'm not going to step away from that work. I learned how to do this when I was a graduate student under different conditions where I used to slice brains on what's called a microtome. So I used to spend time, just cutting very thin slices, it's like a deli slicer, but for a brain, of various types of brains. And I've sectioned through a lot of brains. And we had a rule, which is that when the blade hits the brain, you don't stop pulling, even though it's very, very slow even if a nuclear bomb goes off, even if a fire alarm goes off. Now, I don't want anyone, you know, burning to a crisp because they didn't step away from their workflow. That would be foolish, but that's the mentality that I've embedded in myself, that there's nothing more important than what I'm doing in that 90-minute block. And that's what works for me. You can try various other things. That's what works for me. In addition, I use low level white noise. This is something that is supported by quality, peer-reviewed data. We covered this on the episode on hearing and balance, but it turns out that white noise, which is essentially all frequencies of sound, or all frequencies of sound that we can perceive, mixed up kind of randomly, there's no structure to it, turned on at a low volume, not with headphones most of the time, puts the brain into a state that's optimal for learning and workflow. And I covered two papers during that episode. One that showed that, indeed, brain areas involved in attention, brain areas involved in focus and cognition and memory, those are engaged to a greater degree when there is low levels of white noise playing in the background. The other paper that's really interesting did brain imaging and showed the areas of the brain that are associated with dopamine release are increased by low levels of white noise. Dopamine release is associated not just with pleasure, but with motivation and craving. So everything about this 90-minute block from the low levels of white noise to the position of my computer, how I'm standing, where my eyes are positioned, is geared towards putting me in this tunnel of work. And I have to say that while it can be a challenge to try and achieve this state in this tunnel of work some days, you start to get kind of addicted to it. It feels really good. It's like a workout for the mind. And it is something that as you exit that 90 minutes, you really feel like you've accomplished a lot because often you have, and it just feels deeply satisfying. And I'm convinced that that's because of the release of neuromodulators like dopamine and the norepinephrine that's circulating in your system. And I want to be clear that I'm not perfect about this 90 minutes. Occasionally I get drawn away. Occasionally something will happen or I'll go use the restroom or Costello will have a need or somebody will have a need that I will have to respond to, but I really try and achieve this most, if not every day that I'm alive because for me, that work session is kind of holy. It's where I set up a relationship, not just between me and the work that I'm doing, but between me and my ability to control my own state of mind using these various supports of the white noise, et cetera. But really those supports are peripheral to the fact that I'm creating this space. I'm funneling my brain into a state rather than allowing whatever events and contexts on social media and elsewhere might be occurring in the world that would yank me out of what for me is my purpose and my mission in life, which is to do the sorts of work that I do. There's a powerful way in which you can place the timing of this 90-minute work about in an optimal way."}
{"question": "Is dietary cholesterol a major contributor to the development of atherosclerosis, or is it a myth that eating saturated fat is bad for cardiovascular health?", "doc_id": "DTCmprPCDqc_23", "video_id": "DTCmprPCDqc", "video_title": "Dr. Peter Attia: Exercise, Nutrition, Hormones for Vitality & Longevity", "video_header": "Cholesterol & Dietary Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, LDL & HDL, Apolipoprotein B", "segment_idx": "23", "time_start": "2:02:53", "time_end": "2:17:34", "context": "but not getting stuck in the underlying currents at all. There's tremendous debate about whether or not dietary cholesterol directly relates to, or does not relate to, serum cholesterol, LDL and HDL. Here's my- - Is there? - I think, well, let me put it this way. There are people that argue, I'm certainly not arguing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - There are people that argue that if one eats a ton of saturated fat, that LDL goes up and HDL goes down. - Oh, okay, but that's not dietary cholesterol per se. - No, not dietary cholesterol per se, but, and then there are people that argue that, you know, any increase in saturated fat intake is going to be bad, that you already synthesize enough cholesterol for hormone production, et cetera. I'd like to talk about this in terms of how one should read their charts. My LDL is in what I'm told is healthy range. My HDL is in what I'm told is healthy range. I do try and not overeat things like butter, cheese, and red meat, but I do eat some of those things and I feel pretty good. But most people are operating under the assumption that eating saturated fat is bad, and you only do it insofar as you want to taste it. And then of course there's a small group of people that love to eat organs and meats, and really pack cholesterol, and would argue that it doesn't matter if your LDL is 870, it's not going to impact your health. What's the reality around LDL, HDL, dietary cholesterol, saturated fat, at least in your view? - So first let's differentiate between cholesterol and fat, just for the listener, 'cause we use them, you know, I want to make sure people understand. So, cholesterol is a really complicated molecule. So it's a ringed molecule. God, I used to know exactly what its structure was, but like it could have 36 carbons, for all I remember. It is a lipid, so it is a hydrophobic molecule that is synthesized by every cell in the human body. It is so important that without it, if you look at sort of genetic conditions that impair cholesterol synthesis, depending on their severity, they can be fatal in utero. So in other words, anything that really interferes with our ability to produce cholesterol, is a threat to us as a species. And the reason for that is cholesterol makes up the cell membrane of every cell in our body. So, you know, as you know, but maybe the listeners don't, even though a cell is a spherical thing, it has to be fluid, right? It's not just a rigid like sphere, like a, you know, a blow up ball, right? It's got to be able to kind of move in this way to mesh with other cells. It also has to accommodate having porous structures that traverse its membrane to allow ions and things like that to go across. And it's cholesterol that gives the fluidity to that membrane. It's also, as you're alluding to, the backbone of some of the most important hormones in our body. Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, cortisol. So we have this thing, super important. Okay. Then let's talk about, can you get cholesterol in your diet? Yes, you can eat foods that are rich in cholesterol. What was known in 1960, but somehow escaped everybody's imagination until finally the American Heart Association acknowledged this a few years ago, is that the cholesterol you eat does not really make it into your body. And the reason for that is it's esterified. So we have, and not to get too nerdy, but I think people, I really think it's important people understand how this thing works. So we have cells in our gut, and enterocytes, they're the endothelial cells of our gut. They have, each one of them has basically two transporters on them. So the first is called the Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. The second is called the ATP-binding cassette G5/G8. Okay. The Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter will bring in any sterol, cholesterol, zoosterol, phytosterol. Any sterol that fits through the door will come in. Virtually all of that is the cholesterol we produce that gets taken back to the liver, that the liver packages in bile and secretes. So that's what aids in our digestion, which is another thing I should've mentioned earlier. In addition to using cholesterol for cell membranes and hormones, we wouldn't be able to digest our food without cholesterol, because it's what makes up the bile salts. So our own cholesterol is basically recirculated in a pool throughout our body, and this is the way it gets back into the body. It's through this Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. When it gets in there, the body, this is the checkpoint of regulation. This is where the body says, do you have enough cholesterol in the body, yes or no? If yes, I will let that cholesterol make its way into the circulation. So it'll go off the basolateral side of the cell, not the luminal side, into the body. Alternatively, the body says, you know what? We have enough cholesterol. I'm going to let you poop this out. And now the ATP-binding cassette will shoot it out, it'll go back into the luminal side, and away it goes. So all of the cholesterol in our body is not esterified. And it doesn't have that big, bulky side chain attached to it. The cholesterol you eat is esterified, and an esterified cholesterol molecule simply can't physically pass through that Niemann-pick C1-like 1 transporter. Now, we probably manage to de-esterify 10 to 15% of our dietary cholesterol. So in other words, there are small amounts of dietary cholesterol that do make their way into our circulation, but it represents a small fraction of our total body's pool of cholesterol. Again, this was known, even by Ancel Keys, the guy who turned fat into the biggest boogeyman of all time. Ancel Keys acknowledged this in the 1960s. Dietary cholesterol plays no role in serum cholesterol. Again, it took the American Heart Association another 60 years to figure that out. But even now they acknowledge that. Dietary cholesterol has no bearing. - So why is it that it's pretty easy to find studies, or at least people who are highly credentialed from good institutions, claiming that eating saturated fat- - Saturated fat's different. - Saturated fat and red meat, things that are rich in cholesterol, to be more specific, is bad for us in terms of our eventual LDL. - So this is two different things. So saturated fat consumption in many people will erase LDL cholesterol. So it's important to differentiate between the, what is saturated fat? So saturated fat of course is a fatty acid, just so people understand. Totally different molecule from cholesterol. Cholesterol is this very complicated ring structure, multiple rings stuck together. SFA, saturated fat, is just a long chain fatty acid that is fully saturated, meaning it has no double bonds, and it can exist in isolation. It can exist in a triglyceride, triglycerides, or, you know, a phospho lipid, or all sorts of things like that. So when we eat foods that contain fat, basically there are three distinctions for that fat. Is it saturated, is it monounsaturated, one double bond, or is it polyunsaturated, two or more double bonds? The observation that eating saturated fat raises cholesterol is generally correct. But again, now it makes, because if we're going to start talking about LDL, we have to explain what LDL is. This is another one of those things that's just so grossly misunderstood, that it's, it makes having discussions about this very complicated. Let's go back to the cholesterol problem, right? So every cell in our body makes cholesterol, and almost without exception, they make enough. There are a handful of times, however, when a cell needs to borrow cholesterol from another cell. Okay, so how would you do this, right? So if you're sort of, if you're playing God for a minute and you want to design a system, you have to be able to transport cholesterol from one cell to another. The most logical place you would transport this is through the circulation. And the problem with circulation is it's water. Plasma is water. So now you have this problem, which is, I want to transport cargo that is hydrophobic, in a hydrophilic medium. Can't do it. So if you think about all the things that we transport in our blood, sodium, electrolytes, glucose, things like that, they're water soluble. It's easy. They just move back and forth in our blood with no chaperone. But when you want to move cholesterol, you have to package it in something that's hydrophilic. That something is called a lipoprotein. So we have these spherical molecules that are lipid on the inside, protein on the outside, lipoprotein, and inside they contain cholesterol and triglycerides. So now you've got this spherical thing, triglyceride, cholesterol on the inside, and it's chaperoned by a hydrophilic molecule that allows it to move through our circulation. And those lipoproteins exist in different densities. So if you run these out on a gel electrophoresis plate, you'll identify different densities. The density is a function of how much protein and how much lipid is in it. So the highest density of this is called a high density lipoprotein, and the lowest density of this is called a very low density lipoprotein, a VLDL. And then next to that you have an LDL, a low density lipoprotein, and then next to that you have an IDL, an intermediate density lipoprotein. So, you know, it actually goes VLDL, IDL, LDL, but anyway. So when people say my LDL is high, or my LDL is 100, what are they saying? They're saying the cholesterol concentration of my LDL particles is a hundred milligrams per deciliter. So the total cholesterol concentration you have in your circulation is that number that says total cholesterol. So if someone's blood panel says my total cholesterol's 200, it means that if you take all the lipoproteins in their circulation, bust them open and measure the cholesterol content, it's 200 milligrams per deciliter. And for all intents and purposes, because the IDLs are so short-lived, that's basically the sum of your LDL cholesterol, your VLDL cholesterol, and your HDL cholesterol. Those three things sum to your total cholesterol. - What about LDL little a that you mentioned earlier? - LP little a is another- - LP, excuse me. - Yeah, yeah, he's another actor. He is a special type of LDL that, again, in sort of 10 to 20% of the population, is a really bad actor. So that's an LDL that has another apolipoprotein on it called apolipoprotein little a. - Got it. - The other thing I'll just say on this, because earlier I mentioned ApoB. There are two broad families of lipoproteins. There are those that are wrapped in ApoBs, and those that are wrapped in ApoAs. The ApoA family is the HDL family. The ApoB family is the VLDL, IDL, LDL family. - I see. So for somebody who let's say their total cholesterol is, let's just stay with 200 for simplicity. What do you like to see in terms of the HDL LDL ratio? - Couldn't care less. I only care about ApoB. I only care about ApoB. I care about the causative agent of atherosclerosis. ApoB is the thing that drives atherosclerosis. - And what levels are attractive or repulsive for you when you see levels of ApoB that are blank, you get really concerned? - It depends on the person's objectives. So again, we take a very different view. I mean, we have. - Vitality now, and I want to live to be a hundred. - Yeah, so if you see- - And I'm assuming some taper. - If you tell me you want to live to be a hundred, you're going to need to keep your ApoB below 30 milligrams per deciliter. - Let's say I want to live to be a hundred, but I also, well, how about, I don't care how long I live, but I want to feel great while I live. - Again, it depends, right? Like anybody who's had a heart attack is going to be compromised in their ability to feel well after. Right, so. - I guess, I say it that way, because if you're going to tell me that in order to achieve that live to a hundred level, I'm going to have to give up my personal life and my- - No no, to get- - and my brain functioning, then I'm not really interested. - Sure, but to get LDL levels, and really, again, people think of it as LDL, it's really ApoB, right? ApoB is this total concentration of LDL and VLDL. And that's what matters. Those are the big atherogenic particles. LDL also includes the Lp[a], although the concentration of Lpis relatively speaking so small that it doesn't generally show up as much in the ApoB. So we treat ApoB, and basically what it comes down to is you want ApoB to be as close to the level as it was when you were born. So we start developing heart disease when we're born. That's just the way it is. The autopsy studies make this abundantly clear. When you look at autopsies of young people who are dying in their 20s, and this was first done in the 1970s, it was again repeated. Again, it's always done after we have a war, right? So in the 1970s, it was done on people, you know, who died in Vietnam. In the early 2000s it was done on mostly young men, but some young women, who were, you know, dying in Iraq and Afghanistan. And we saw without any ambiguity that cardiovascular disease is already taking hold in people who are 18, 19, 20-years-old. - Wow! - And to be clear, they aren't going to die of atherosclerosis at that age. They're still 40, 50 years away from it. But this is a lifelong disease. And we also know that the disease can't really develop until ApoB reaches a certain threshold. And that's the threshold that most of us get to by the time we're sort of in our teens. So it's this really young ApoB level of kind of 20 to 30 milligrams per deciliter, that makes it impossible to get atherosclerosis. So ApoB is necessary, but not sufficient to develop ASCVD. Now that, go ahead. - Oh, I'm sorry, I was just going to ask, what are some of the top behavioral nutritional supplementation, if any, based,"}
{"question": "What are some effective ways to increase alertness and improve focus, and how can I safely boost my mental clarity without relying on caffeine or other stimulants?", "doc_id": "LG53Vxum0as_33", "video_id": "LG53Vxum0as", "video_title": "How to Focus to Change Your Brain", "video_header": "How to Focus", "segment_idx": "33", "time_start": "53:36", "time_end": "55:21", "context": "maybe even nodding your head subconsciously and none of it sinks in. This can be very damaging for school, work performance and relationships as many of you know. Costello incidentally never seems to pay attention to anything I say while looking directly at me, which contradicts what I'm about to say, which is that the best way to get better at focusing is to use the mechanisms of focus that you were born with. And the key principle here is that mental focus follows visual focus. We are all familiar with the fact that our visual system can be unfocused, blurry or jumping around or we can be very laser focused on one location in space. What's interesting and vitally important to understanding how to access neuroplasticity is that you can use your visual focus and you can increase your visual focus as a way of increasing your mental focus abilities more broadly. So I'm going to explain how to do that. Plasticity starts with alertness. And as I mentioned before, that alertness can come from a sense of love, a sense of joy, a sense of fear, doesn't matter. There are pharmacologic ways to access alertness too. The most common one is of course caffeine which if you watch the sleep episodes, you know reduces this molecule that makes us sleepy called adenosine. I drink plenty of caffeine. I'm a heavy user of caffeine. I don't think abuser of caffeine. I think in reasonable amounts provided we can still fall asleep at night, caffeine can be a relatively safe way to increase epinephrin. Now, many people are now also using Adderall. Adderall chemically looks a lot like amphetamine and basically it is amphetamine."}

{"question": "Can meditation help us better understand the relationship between our body and mind, and how the brain and body interact to create our sense of self?", "doc_id": "-wIt_WsJGfw_3", "video_id": "-wIt_WsJGfw", "video_title": "Dr. Sam Harris: Using Meditation to Focus, View Consciousness & Expand Your Mind | Huberman Lab 105", "video_header": "Sense of Self in Brain & Body", "segment_idx": "3", "time_start": "18:15", "time_end": "25:25", "context": "can improve focus, reduce stress, et cetera. It's there. It's not an enormous pile of evidence, but it's growing. And-- SAM HARRIS: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --I think that especially for some of the shorter meditations, which I these days view more as perceptual exercises. I've talked about this in the podcast before. But for those who haven't heard it before about perception. You can have extra perception extending to things beyond the confines of your skin. Interception, which is, I think, also includes the surface of the skin but everything inward. And meditation through eyes closed typically involving some sort of attentional spotlighting, something we'll get into more. Interior receptive versus external receptive events, et cetera, including thoughts. And-- so I think of-- at a basic level meditation as somewhat of a perceptual exercise. You can tell me where you disagree there, and I would expect and hope that you would. SAM HARRIS: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But I would like to just touch on this idea that you brought up because it's such an interesting one. Of this idea that our bodies are containers and that we somehow view ourselves as passengers within those containers. That's certainly been my experience. And the image that I have is of-- as you say, that is of myself or of people out there that sit a few centimeters below the surface or that sit entirely in their head. And, of course, the brain and body are connected through the nervous system. I think sometimes a brain is used to replace a nervous system, and that can get us into trouble in terms of coming up with real directions and definitions. But the point is that there is something special about the real estate in the head. I think for as much as my laboratory, and many other scientists are really interested in brain-body connections through the nervous system and other organ systems that the nervous system binds that if you cut off all my limbs, I'm going to be different, but I'm fundamentally still Andrew. SAM HARRIS: Right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Whereas if we were to lesion a couple of square millimeters out of my parietal cortex, it's an open question as to whether or not I would still seem as much like Andrew to other people and to myself-- SAM HARRIS: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --even. And so there is something fundamentally different about the real estate in the cranial vault. SAM HARRIS: Yeah. I mean, we are-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: You can even remove both of my eyes, I'd still be Andrew. And those are two pieces of my central nervous system that are fundamental to my daily life, but I'd still be me. Whereas-- and this doesn't, I think, just apply to memory systems. I mean, I think there are regions of the frontal cortex that, when destroyed, have been shown to modify personality and self-perception in dramatic ways. So it's a sort of obvious point once it's made, but I do think it's worth highlighting because there does seem to be something special about being in the head. The other thing is that sitting a few centimeters below the surface or riding in this container makes sense to me. Except I wonder if you've ever experienced a shift as I have when something very extreme happens. Let's use the negative example of all of a sudden you're in a fear state. All of a sudden, it feels as if your entire body is you or is me. And now I need to get this thing-- the whole container and me to some place of safety in whatever form. This is also true, I think, in ecstatic states-- SAM HARRIS: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --where you can feel really-- when people say embodied, I wonder whether or not we normally oscillate below the surface of our body. When I say oscillate, I mean in neural terms. I mean, maybe our sensory experience is not truly at the bodily surface but sits below the bodily surface more at the level of organ systems and within our head. And then certain things that jolt us-- our autonomic nervous system into heightened states bring us into states of-- bring us closer to the surface and therefore include all of us. Again, I don't want to take us down a mechanistic description of something that doesn't exist. But does any of that resonate in terms of how you are thinking about or describing the self? SAM HARRIS: Yeah, yeah. There's a lot there. First, on the point of the brain being the locus of what we are as minds. Yeah, I mean, there are people who will insist that sort of the whole nervous system has to be thought of as a-- when you're talking about our emotional life and the insulas connection to the gut. And just the sense of self extends beyond the brain. But I totally take your point that a brain transplant is a coherent idea, and you would expect to go with the brain rather than with the viscera. And so, in that sense, we really are the old philosophical thought experiment of being a brain in a VAT. I mean, we essentially are already-- the VAT is our skull, and we're virtually in that situation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: A horrible movie. I'm sorry I can't help but interrupt. SAM HARRIS: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: When I was a teenager, my sister and I used to go to the movies every once in a while, and we'd trade off who could pick the movie. And she took me to see once the movie Boxing Helena. SAM HARRIS: Oh yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: The David Lynch film-- SAM HARRIS: Which I never saw that again. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --where he amputates the limbs of a woman who he's obsessed by and keeps her. It's a really horrible-- SAM HARRIS: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --film. And about 20 minutes into it, my sister just turned to me and said, I'm so sorry. And the question there was whether or not two siblings should actually persist in a movie like that. SAM HARRIS: Right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And we decided to persist in the movie so that we could laugh about it later. But it was rather disturbing. I don't recommend the movie. Nor do I recommend seeing it with a sibling. But in that movie, the woman, he takes her as a container and restricts her movement. Quite sadistic and horrible thing really. David Lynch, interesting mind perhaps. But the idea was to question how much of the person persists in the absence of their ability to move, et cetera. Could there be love? Could there be these other affections? Anyway, a rather extreme example. But one that still haunts me. And I suppose I'm thinking about still now. SAM HARRIS: Yeah, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. SAM HARRIS: Well, so just to follow that point, there's a lot about us that we don't have access to unless we enact it physically. Like if I ask you, do you still know how to ride a bike? There's no place in your memory where you can inspect but just sitting in your chair that you've retained the knowledge of how to ride a bike. Procedural memory is different from semantic or episodic memory. If I asked you, do you know your address? Yes, you can recall your address just sitting there. But if you had had a micro stroke that neatly dissected out your ability to ride a bike and left everything else intact, you might think you could ride a bike. But suddenly, you stand up next to one. And you have no idea what to do with it. And that would be a discovery that would only happen if you were motorically engaged with that object.

because I haven't asked um any negative consequences of birth control of any kind and I'm not encouraging you to if you don't believe in them I know that this is a very controversial um topic but um you know one of the more popular studies discussed on social media is one that I I've spent some time with the paper um and a few of the papers that stemmed from it um not a huge study but describing that how women rate the faces of men as either more essentially what happens is there there seems to be at least in this study a there was a a statistically significant um bias uh for women to select particular male faces as attractive and those male faces tended to be of the more you know square jaw AKA masculine features right in a quotes right this is what the study um found um but that when women were on oral contraception presumably estrogen progestin type oral contraception that that effect um was smeared they had a not a statistically significant tendency to uh choose the quote unquote more masculine faces I have to be very careful with my language here because you know it's easy to get description of a study like this wrong and that has led a lot of people to think that birth control is going to throw off their partner Choice um now of course it's a small study um studies like it are not always so well controlled um but is there any evidence that birth control oral oral estrogen progestin based birth control just to keep it specific can increase rates of cancers can decrease rates of cancers can lead to um any sorts of disruptions in um bodily uh function or health that's really like a rock solid result that's been seen by multiple studies clinical trials um or are we still just in the dark about a lot of this stuff okay so nothing is without risk getting pregnant is not without risk taking the birth control pill is not without risk we do see that there's been a lot of not informed consent and people who are taking the birth control pill meaning maybe they weren't educated about what all of their options were the positives and the negatives about each one of them if we're going to reference the combo to the pill estrogen progesterone pill important to understand that neither the estrogen nor the progesterone are the same estrogen progesterone that your ovaries make right it's ethanol estradi which your brain interprets as an estrogen but other parts of your body may not and then it's various types of progestins some of which have even androgenic or male hormonik properties and some of which do not so there's a ton of variation even the amount of ethanol estradi that each pill has with your low low and your low pills having less and even with the modern-day average pill having a lot less estrogen than it used to when you're on the birth control pill your ovaries aren't making estradiol and that estradiol is important in growing the uterine lining but also for the genital structures and so we think about vaginal health and bulvar health we certainly see that especially with continuous use so if we distinguish you take the pill for 21 days and you have a 7-Day break where you might bleed or you take sugar pills and then you take them again a lot of people now are taking continuously where you have exposure to these compounds every single day H so in in like the the um the wheel the little little pouch with a wheel of different colored pills um may have seen these on the on the countertop in previous relationships um and then there's the ones that sometimes people just opt not to take because those are the not the placebo sugar pills so like that there's no need to take Esten during that phase and then and then they repeat is that exactly okay but some people are taking estrogen continu very common right now so people and they're not wrong they say oh well why have a period in these little breaks it's not really a reflection of my hormone status which is accurate and so they're taking them continuously you also have less pill failure pregnancies so if you're using the pill for contraception that can be a great strategy but the longer you take them we do see some vaginal and vulvar changes right and so Ric vaginitis people who notice increased sensitivity decreased elasticity increased discomfort with intercourse increase in like yeast infections that can sometimes be see because that environment is different now that's just one thing that can come from the pill we also see the pill be life saving for other people they have terrible you know PMS or premenstrual dysphoric syndrome where their mental health when they change from high to low estrogen it's always the change in estrogen that interferes can cause some people to really have mental health issues that are so severe that having that stable hormone level is helpful and so the pill can be extremely beneficial for some people when it comes to mental health it can be beneficial for people who have issues with very heavy periods and anemia instead of getting blood transfusions you know taking the birth control pill might prevent the lining of the uterus from growing so much that they bleed so much same thing with fibroids people with PCOS PCOS is polycystic ovarian syndrome if we want to put it very simply you have a lot of eggs in your Vault so you release a lot of eggs every month and what this does is the FSH signal gets diluted and so you're not responding to the normal signal and you don't ovulate and because the ovary is a hormone making factory it gets really bored when it can't make estrogen because that egg's not growing so it starts to make testosterone so you start to see this Androgen dominant environment associated with lack of ovulation and having a lot of follicles inside the ovary that are not really responding and the androgens excuse me androgenization of other tissues like like body hair deepening of voice body hair typically the level of testosterone made in PCOS isn't truly deepening voice it can if there is an ovarian tumor making testosterone or certain other conditions but typically with PCOS you see increase in body hair increase in acne and you can see some even like male pattern balding some temporal balding of women so some hair loss temporal Bal so like the W the Widow peing yeah the Widow peeking and then thinning out in these two areas and then we see an increase in body composition towards a male level so if we think about a male body holding your fat in your abdominal region and if we think about the traditional female body holding more fat in the hips and thighs area we see that when this hormone shifts in PCOS you tend to get more abdominal fat distribution which then leads to further insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome but in PCOS because you're not ovulating and those ovaries each little follicle makes a tiny amount of estrogen we'll say each little follicle when it's not responding will make you know one to two peagrams of estrogen but if you have 50 of them each month you're having some constant estrogen exposure so that lining of the uterus is being constantly stimulated to grow and you're never getting the progesterone to stabilize or the progesterone withdraw to bleed so endometrial cancer is much higher in people with PCOS who don't ovulate and the birth control pill can prevent that any unopposed estrogen situation because the body is made to have both estrogen and progesterone so we see an immense decrease in endometrial cancer an immense drop in ovarian cancer ovarian cancer comes from the remodeling of the ovary so every time you have a follicle grow and it ruptures and it makes the Corpus ludum and then it heals up those are opportunities for those cancer cells to go away in that remodeling process and lead to ovarian cancer and because you're not ovulating on the pill your incidence of ovarian cancer drops dramatically 10 years of pel use has dropped the chance you get ovarian cancer by more than 90% And of course ovarian cancer is super hard to diagnose because the inovation to the perianal system is poor and you don't have any out signs often to late stage disease that being said could you potentially have an increase in breast cancer in some people by taking the Pill by taking the pill that that's a concern especially in people who might be predisposed to this for some other reason they might have braa mutations or something like that um and then is there a situation where the pill certainly masks what's going on with your menstrual cycle and I really think this is where Women's Health had has a huge hist and paternalism meaning doctors would just tell people this is what you're going to do so your periods are irregular here is the birth control pill and they're not explaining why or the pros and cons to it and what happens is people are not being taught how their bodies work and now they are because of your podcast amongst others and now they're able to know that my period is a Vital sign and I don't know what it is because the pill is producing a different environment the pill's also been associated with potentially development of things like leaky gut or IBS and so there is a definite change in your environment when you're on the birth control pill increase risk of blood clots because of how it's processed in the liver increasing your clotting factors can I just U up there you know I'm aware um that a a fair"}
{"question": "What are the benefits and risks of using conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) for hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in women going through menopause?", "doc_id": "DTCmprPCDqc_16", "video_id": "DTCmprPCDqc", "video_title": "Dr. Peter Attia: Exercise, Nutrition, Hormones for Vitality & Longevity", "video_header": "Hormone Replacement Therapy, Menopause & Breast Cancer Risk", "segment_idx": "16", "time_start": "1:10:13", "time_end": "1:22:03", "context": "with some of the symptoms of menopause. So what do women experience when they go through menopause? The first symptoms are what are called vasomotor symptoms. So this is usually in the form of night sweats, hot flashes. So, and depending on the woman, this can be really significant, right? These are women who can have a hard time sleeping. They can be having hot flashes during the middle of the day. They can wake up soaked in a pool of sweat. Those tend to pass after a couple of years, and then they get into sort of the more long-term complications of menopause. So what we call vaginal atrophy, vaginal dryness, and then the stuff that we talked about a while ago, which is the osteopenia osteoporosis. A lot of women will complain of brain fog. So, I mean, clearly this was an issue and it was recognized 70 years ago. Why don't we give women estrogen back to replace that hormone? And so that went on for a couple of decades, maybe less, maybe a decade, and then it was realized, wait a minute, we were driving up the risk of uterine cancer. And the reason for that is if you just give estrogen with no progesterone to antagonize it, you will thicken the endometrium endlessly and you will increase the risk of hyperplasia. Well, you'll definitely undergo hyperplasia, and then ultimately dysplasia. Dysplasia is precancerous, and ultimately we were seeing that. So people figured out, well, actually, if you want to give estrogen to a woman who still has her uterus, you have to give her progesterone as well. You have to be able to have a hormone to oppose the estrogen. And then that became effectively in, call it the 1970s-ish, the standard for HRT. So in the early 1990s the NIH said, look, we haven't really studied this. We have a ton of epidemiology that says giving women hormones seems to be doing really good things. They feel better, so all their symptoms go away. They seem to have lower risk of heart disease, lower risk of, you know, cardiovascular, pardon me, lower risk of cardiovascular disease, lower risk of bone fractures. Everything seems to get better. Lower risk of diabetes. But we haven't tested this in a randomized prospective trial, so let's do this. So that became the WHI. And it randomized, it had two parallel arms. So it had a group for women who did not have a uterus. So these are women that had undergone hysterectomy for some other reason. And then it had a group for women that did have their uterus. In the first group, there was a placebo arm and then an estrogen only arm. And in the other group, there was a progesterone plus estrogen versus a placebo. Everything about the way this study was done is a bit wonky. Some of it is justifiable, but it's important to understand. First, the women were all way outside of menopause. So none of these women were started when you would normally start HRT. And there were probably several reasons for that, but one of them is, and I think this is a legitimate reason, they wanted hard outcomes. They wanted to know death rates. And if you're doing this on women in their 50s, you just weren't going to get it, right. You couldn't- - Wait too long. - Yeah, you got to wait too long. And this was only going to be like a seven to 10-year study. So they had to do this on women who were much older. They also disproportionately took much sicker women. I believe the prevalence, and again, I'm going to get some of these numbers wrong and people are going to get all phosphorylated, but, you know, I mean, I'm in the ballpark, right? Something like 30, 40% of these women were smokers. The prevalence of obesity, diabetes was enormous. So they really disproportionately picked the most unhealthy population they could, that was pretty advanced in age. And again, I think part of that was to say, look, we want to make sure that after seven years, we really know if there's a difference in these causes of death. The other thing is, this is kind of weird, although again, I understand their rationale for it, but this is a great example of be very careful when you look at a clinical trial, that it remotely represents the patients you're interested in treating. So they also treated no patients who were symptomatic. The rationale being, if we include in the study patients who are symptomatic, those who are randomized to placebo will drop out. - Okay, it makes sense in terms of study design, makes no sense if the study design is intended to mimic the real world. - That's right. So now let's just keep track of the three issues. We have a disproportionately unhealthy patient population who are not symptomatic, and we're starting them more than 10 years after menopause. The next thing that they did, which again, I understand why they did it, but it's now the fourth strike against this study, is, and I've spoken with the PI of the study and asked this question point blank. I'm actually going to have her on my podcast at some point soon to go over this in more detail, is why did you use conjugated equine estrogen, an MPA, which is a synthetic form of progesterone. - Horse- - Yes. - estrogen? - It's horse urine, is they collect horse urine, so they're getting, it's- - Horses do urinate a lot. Or at least when they urinate, it seems like a large volume of urine, from what I've observed. - You have a lot of experience with this? - No, but, you know, my sister rode horses for a little while, my high school girlfriend had a horse, and that thing, I mean the pees were legendary. It's a male horse. - Yeah. - Yeah. - So, yeah, so the conjugated equine estrogen is the estrogen that's collected from female horses. And then it's a synthetic progesterone. And I said to the person, I said, well, why didn't you use what we use today, which is bio-identical estrogen in progesterone. Like today, when we put women on estrogen, we use a, it's an FDA product called the Vivelle-Dot. So it's a patch that you just put on, and it's estradiol, but it's bioidentical estradiol. And we use what's called micronized progesterone. So bio-identical progesterone. And she said, well, at the time we just wanted to test what was currently being used. And I said, totally makes sense. But again, now you have four considerations that you have to keep in mind, okay. So despite those four considerations, and I'm going to make a case for you why I think the MPA created a real problem in that study, the synthetic progesterone, when the preliminary results were first made available, but not yet peer-reviewed and not yet published, there was a huge fiasco, huge press announcement about it, suggesting that the women receiving the CEE plus MPA, in the group with the uterus, had a higher incidence of breast cancer. And that basically became the headline that never went away, though it turned out not to be true. Let's talk about the numbers. What was the increase in the risk of breast cancer in that group? Which gets to one of my, you know, if you ever listen to me on a podcast rail on something. - Listen, I have about 3,800 pet peeves and counting. My laboratory staff know these, know a good number of them. So, you do not have - Here, I'll add to one of them. - to apologize for having many pet peeves. Because as long as they have experience in data to support them, it provides- - So one of my biggest pet peeves is, and my team knows this 'cause sometimes they'll occasionally, you know, they'll do this and I'll have to remind them, you never talk about a relative risk change without an absolute risk accommodating it, right. So, what does that look like? So the relative risk increase of breast cancer in the estrogen plus MPA group versus the placebo was 25, 27%. And that became the only headline. HRT increases risk of breast cancer by 27%. Now, I don't think that's true at all today, but let's even look at the data. What was the ARR? What was the absolute risk increase? It was a difference between five cases per thousand and four cases per thousand. So the ARR was 0.1%, one case in a thousand. And it's true, going from four in a thousand to five in a thousand is a 25% increase, but it's a completely inappropriate context. - I agree, and I feel like headlines of that sort, which have come up recently around various dietary interventions, we won't go there, at least not for the time being, are nothing short of criminal because they really distort people's thinking. But also they steer the course of science and medicine for, as you pointed out, for decades, if not longer. And they can really take us off our health track in serious ways. - So I'll bring this meandering to a close, which is to say, even though I could spend the next hour talking about all of the ways in which this study was flawed, and all of the very unethical things that were done by a number of the investigators who went out of their way to mask the truth of this study from the world, I'll tell a woman today, we're going to start you on this when you're going through menopause. We're using bio-identical hormones. And if your upper bound risk of breast cancer is one case in a thousand, you should at least weigh that against all of the other benefits, which I'll talk about. Now, there's something else I want to say, because a moment ago I alluded to the fact that I think the MPA might have been the biggest issue in that study. So there were two findings in that study that were negative. One was the small increase in the risk of heart disease, and the small increase in the risk of breast cancer. But consider the other group, we forgot about the group that didn't have a uterus. 'Cause remember, those women got estrogen only versus placebo. What was the difference in breast cancer there? Well, this is interesting 'cause it didn't reach statistical significance, but its P value was 0.06 or 0.07. So it came very close, but it was in the opposite direction. It was a 24% risk reduction, about one in a thousand as well. So when you had estrogen plus MPA, you had a barely statistically significant, the P value was 0.05, so it just hit statistical significance, one in a thousand cases for breast cancer. And then you had one in a thousand cases, but P value of 0.07, for reduction of risk of breast cancer. Which to me suggests that the MPA, the synthetic progesterone, was playing more of a role than anything else. The second thing I point out is oral estrogen, which we no longer use, does increase coagulability. It does increase the ability of the blood to clot a little bit. And when we look at the more recent data on HRT, using topical estrogen or patches of estrogen, we don't see that at all. In fact, we see the opposite now. So now we see the risk of heart disease going down in women with estradiol. - And some women will be arriving to those treatments with mutations and things like Factor V Leiden and other clotting factors. Is it appropriate to say that everyone, both male and female, should know whether or not they have mutant forms of Factor V Leiden? - You know, we don't typically test people for Factor V. My wife actually has it, but we didn't learn it until she had HELLP syndrome giving birth to our first daughter. But, you know, we kind of look for more family history reason to be testing things like that. We take a pretty detailed family history, so we'll kind of look for clotting issues there. - What about, so your reflex nowadays is to put women on these topical estrogen therapies? - Well it's to basically"}
{"question": "Does heat therapy, such as sauna use, have any direct effects on hormone levels in men, aside from reducing cortisol?", "doc_id": "x7qbJeRxWGw_34", "video_id": "x7qbJeRxWGw", "video_title": "How to Control Your Metabolism by Thyroid & Growth Hormone", "video_header": "2021 (New) Study: Heat Increases GH, & Lowers Cortisol, No Effects On Testosterone, DHEA Or Prolactin", "segment_idx": "34", "time_start": "1:34:35", "time_end": "1:35:57", "context": "\"Endocrine Effects of Repeated Hot Thermal Stress and Cold Water Immersion in Young Adult Men.\" Unfortunately, it was just in men, they didn't look at women, but nonetheless I think the data are relevant to everybody as a general theme. This is Podstawski et al. I will put a link to the study in the caption and they looked at testosterone, prolactin, cortisol, et cetera. And what they found was that the sauna does indeed lead to a significant decrease in cortisol, a stress hormone, a hormone that you want to be released early in the day when you wake up. But sauna definitely led to significant decrease in cortisol but did not change testosterone, DHEA or prolactin levels. So that's interesting. And it turns out that the cold did affect some of these hormones but the results there were a little bit more mixed. So the takeaway here is that heat seems to have positive effects on growth hormone, big effects. It seems to have positive effects on reducing cortisol levels. And it does not seem to have effects on things like testosterone, DHEA, or prolactin directly. You can imagine that a shift in any hormone is going to alter the levels of other hormones down the lines or have indirect effects but in terms of direct effects just during or immediately after the sauna bath, there were no effects. So we've talked about diet, supplementation, behavioral tools."}
{"question": "What are some behavioral practices called Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR) that can help with sleep, anxiety, and overall well-being?", "doc_id": "gXvuJu1kt48_2", "video_id": "gXvuJu1kt48", "video_title": "The Effects of Cannabis (Marijuana) on the Brain & Body | Huberman Lab Podcast #92", "video_header": "Tool: Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR), Sleep & Anxiety", "segment_idx": "2", "time_start": "7:03", "time_end": "10:02", "context": "Before diving into all of that, I'd like to highlight a new, what I think is a very useful and zero cost resource. This resource is what's called Non-Sleep Deep Rest or NSDR protocol. I've talked many times before on the Huberman Lab Podcast about Non-Sleep Deep Rest, AKA, NSDR. NSDR is sort of an umbrella term for a variety of different practices, so these are behavioral practices that allow you to direct your brain and body into a particular state, and most typically, that state is one of deep relaxation, but also one in which you can access your bodily and brain systems for teaching yourself how to relax in real time and how to recover some of the sleep that you may not be getting at night, and to restore levels of dopamine in particular areas of the brain that are involved in motivation and cognitive and motor control. Basically, NSDR is a wonderfully restorative tool. This has been demonstrated many times over now through quality peer-reviewed science, and there are neurochemical benefits, and there are physical benefits, and there are certainly psychological benefits. I highly recommend NSDR to anybody that has trouble falling asleep or that wakes up in the middle of the night and needs to get better at falling back asleep, as well as to anyone out there that has issues with anxiety or self-regulation of any kind. And if you don't have any of those issues, it's also immensely beneficial just as a restorative for leaning back into focused work of any kind. Now, a number of people have reached out about finding NSDR protocols, and there are a number of different good ones out there floating around. I've decided to put a zero-cost NSDR script out there on the internet for people to access, so you can find it by going to YouTube and simply put my last name, 'Huberman' and 'NSDR' into the search function. This is a YouTube channel that's hosted by Virtusan, which has a terrific app that includes NSDR and a number of other health and wellness protocols, but they've been quite generous in hosting a 10 minute NSDR, read by me. This NSDR is distinct from, although I should say, similar to yoga nidra, which some of you are familiar with. This NSDR is different than yoga nidra in the sense that it doesn't have intentions. There's no mystical component, and I describe a little bit of the science and why specific components of the NSDR are included, things like long exhale breathing, I talk about perceptual shifts and how to move from thinking and planning to pure sensation. If none of that makes sense right now, it'll make total sense after listening to the NSDR script. Again, it's a 10 minute NSDR script, read by me. You can do this first thing in the morning when you wake up, especially if you didn't get enough sleep that night, and you're feeling a little bit fatigued, and you need to lean into the day with full vigor. You could do it at any point during the day or if you wake up in the middle of the night. Again, this is a zero-cost resource for you. You can find it by going to YouTube, put my last name in and NSDR. I encourage you to try it, and if you like it or frankly, if you don't, you can just put that in the comment section there on YouTube, and I've put it there as a free resource to you, so that you can benefit from the research-backed, peer-reviewed studies that point to NSDR as a very useful practice.

there was just a study published I just covered it on my on my channel where they took men with general anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder and they had them resistance train two times a week for 25 minutes a session 50 minutes total eight weeks it's not much training I think it was like 6 hours and 40 minutes of total training over the entire two months now in statistics you're familiar with an effect size which is basically how meaningful is an effect because you can have a a significant effect that isn't very meaningful if you have enough subject number so when we say things like an effect size 02 is considered small 0.5 is considered moderate and 08 is considered large anything above 08 ssris are typically in the. 3 to 0.5 range um I think in like best case scenarios I get around a 08 7.8 the effect size for resistance training two times a week 25 minutes a day for eight weeks was a 1.7 wow on major depressive disorder wow anybody who's a scientist out there if they hear effect size of 1.7 they do exactly what you did their eyebrows go up and they go they you know they sure that's right you don't see effect sizes like that very often and I want to be very clear I'm not saying do resistance training in place of ssris that's a very but these and these uh individuals had not trained they hadn't trained yeah they were they were healthy or I actually don't know the specific characteristics but I knew they were coming from like not training right now hey like listen both these things can be true maybe somebody needs to get an SSRI because like depressed people don't even want to get out of bed a lot of times right so getting them to the gym even if they know it's going to help them is a hard it's a hard swing so maybe coupling that but that's just resistance training and that affects this right so I think one of the biggest revolutions we're going to see in science is the broad application of biopsychosocial across a bunch of different disciplines and stop thinking about well your body's a bag of meat and it's attached to your brain and if you poke the bag punch the bag burn the bag cut the bag brain goes owie and I think we're going to start thinking about things much differently and I think it's going to open up a lot more in science and in fact honestly if I had to go back and do a PhD again it it would be in some sort of like psychology or or whatnot because I just think there's so much untapped in that realm and I was actually talking about this with um somebody the other day and it's pure anecdote I'm completely speculating I have yet to see an interview with somebody who's in their 90s or hundreds who sounds really stressed out they're they're mostly like dgaf right and when you ask them what they did like most of them say I drink wine every night or I the one thing I remember she was like0 she like yeah I drink Dr Pepper every day or whatever it strikes me that and again genetics matter their lifestyle matters I'm not saying that stuff doesn't matter I I don't see at least in my experience people who make it old age they not usually very spun up all the time I I just I haven't observed that I don't know if you've seen similar observations or they seem to enjoy life I have a grandfather on one side that died um earlier but a grandfather on the other side who lived into his 90s and he ate a steak every day he smoked till pretty late in life before he eventually uh quit he had ice cream dessert uh after every dinner is Argentine so they they stack their meals toward the end of the day definitely like walking did I guess the point is that he was always interested in what was in the newspapers but he wouldn't get riled up about it he liked walking he really enjoyed life like if there's one you know key characteristic to describe him is he really enjoyed life um now he didn't take the best care of himself in the in the sense that had he perhaps never smoked or quit earlier or you know dropped the excess calories he might have lived in additional two or three years but he was really happy until the end and that's the lesson there is we're not saying that that stuff doesn't matter he would have gotten better results if he hadn't smoked if he had you know paid more attention to his nutrition that sort of thing but we have to keep in mind like what is the the hierarchy of importance and the power here right and so I I'll give you an example it's it's a it's we're going to zoom in on the blade of grass but I believe it relates back to this this conversation we're having so we know creatin works because we've got thousands of double blind Placebo control trials showing that creatin works right but there was a study where they gave people creatin or didn't give them creatin and then randomly told them if they got it or not meaning you had people who didn't get creatin got creatin who didn't get it told they didn't get it people who got it told they got it and people who got it told they didn't get it and what they found was the results and I forget what they actually specifically measured but the results basically were like not what they got what they told them okay now people will misinterpret that as see creatin doesn't work no no no it works it just means your beliefs about what creatin does are more powerful than what it actually does just like actually there's a similar trial with caffeine and um I'm thinking about um there was a study um braad I don't have the specific citation but they they had two groups of men train drug free one group they told they were getting steroids that group gained significantly more strength than muscle mass now I would argue that's probably because they're going into training sessions believing that they can train harder believing that they will recover better but that goes to show the power of placebo and the power of belief when I say Placebo people think what I'm saying is you're lying about your experience that is not what I am saying at all I think your experience is probably quite valid what I'm saying is it may not be due to the thing you think it's due to but your beliefs about the thing and so where I get really focused is let's do the big stuff right because so many people are so worried about little stuff and one of the things I'll tell them is hey I have no data to back this up but my intuition tells me that the amount of stress you're spending on these small variables is probably killing you faster than if you got those variables wrong and if we could just focus on the big rocks first and and and if we can pick up some Pebbles after we get the big rocks great but don't drop the big rocks trying to pick up Pebbles I love it and I love this example of uh the creatine experiment because just to repeat the conclusion um because I want to make sure that people don't take away the wrong conclusion creatine Works absolutely but your belief about creatine Works more in this case yeah so two things can work one more than the other and the placebo AKA belief effects are very very powerful exactly I"}

And I can't remember which way it goes and it's minuscule and you need a thousand people in your sample size to be able to see anything, but you see it in other primates, it's already there in fetal sonograms, all of that. So that's a readout of subtle differences in prenatal exposure, and that winds up being a predictor of a whole range of sort of stuff in adult behavior. So, yeah, at the fetal end, when you're still building everything, testosterone and the amount of that is making a huge difference. By the time you're an adult, it's just somewhat of an old and a non-signal. - Yeah, I have a confession, which is that I was a master's student at Berkeley in Marc Breedlove's arena, so I'm an author on that paper, although I'm deep within the author line, and you got the description of it exactly right that it's the D2, the index finger to the ring finger ratio is more similar in females than it is in males. In males, the index finger tends to be shorter. And for people out there who are listening to this who are now freaking out or measuring, that there is a proper way to measure this, which is, eyeballing it doesn't work all the time unless at the extremes. And there's some very interesting stories there. It actually has been replicated no fewer than five times, Marc Breedlove tells me. But yes, in terms of these early organizing effects, those seem very robust in most studies. These later effects are sort of activation of neural circuits by hormones.

And so you're able to process those events and then suddenly you wake up and there's a surge of adrenaline of epinephrin that's now coupled to that experience. So nightmares very likely in slow wave sleep and that kind of panic on waking from something very likely to be an invasion of the thoughts and ideas, however distorted in REM sleep invading the waking state. In fact, that brings to mind something that I've mentioned once before, but I wanna mention again, this atonia, this paralysis that we experience during sleep can invade the waking state. Many people report the experience of waking up and being paralyzed. They're legitimately waking up, it's not a dream. Waking up and being paralyzed, and it is terrifying. I've had this happen before. It is I can tell you terrifying to be wide awake, and as far as I could tell fully conscious, but unable to move. And then generally you can jolt yourself out of it in a few seconds, but it is quite frightening. Now some people actually experience waking up, being fully paralyzed and hallucinating.

and with are these peptides that can improve sleep not just by virtue of enhancing growth hormone release but um you know I'll just be very direct I um for the last gosh like four to six months I've had the opportunity to try pineline um and uh injectable pineline um combined with glycine yes um goodness gracious in the positive sense of the goodness gracious you're from the south so I don't know where where people how they never before have I found something that can improve the amount of rapid eye movement sleep that I get yeah besides rapid eye movement sleep deprivation you know sleep deprivation the next night you'll get a compensatory effect that's not the way to increase your Rim sleep folks you know there are a lot of things like um high-intensity exercise that improve my slow wave deep sleep um cold plunge early in the day improve slow deep sleep there been a few other things but with pinin I'm and by the way I'm not doing this every night I do this occasionally by Rand a little experiment and I track my sleep using the sleep tracker that's in eight sleep um and it's doubling the amount of rapid eye movement sleep that I'm getting doubling yeah which is so like from an hour to two hours or from an hour and 30 near near nearly 3 hours you know even um I posted a picture of a sleep score with some rapid eye movement sleep it's not something I typically do but um even the uh the the most competitive of biohackers uh Brian Johnson was like oh nice sleep score you know um now he touts a sleep score that's perfect every night for you know um for for every night but um and I'm kind of poking at Brian because we like to poke back and forth we're friendly with one another um so the point being that pinealon is a remarkable way to increase rapid ey movement sleep I have very little knowledge about it except that I my understanding is that it might stimulate some um regeneration or stimulation of the Pineo sites so the pineal that's exactly it mhm you've nailed it yeah I remember when you messaged me after starting it and you were like this is amazing it's amazing yeah that you were saying amazing I hope the FDA doesn't nuke it as a consequence of this conversation I hope so too no but I mean your response is what wece with our other patients who are who are loving and I think that combination with glycine I'm a big fan of glycine and injecting it seems to work really well um but back to your question about pinealon yeah I mean it's a bit one of the smallest peptides uh but I think it's one of the most profound we used to combine it with epitalon the the Russian peptide that was used for circadian rhythm and for my understanding um epitalon also um it's involved in DNA repair and might has been explored in animal studies for um trying to offset vision loss in some retinal degenerative conditions yeah again put on the do not compound list um with all the others that's gone um but panon stays and remains and yeah your response to it and experien with has been very commonplace from working with patients and seeing that it's I I think there's a circadian rhythm aspect with it as well you know and helping with melatonin production obviously that comes from the pineal gland um I this is just I'm postulating I think there's more to the pineal gland than we understand oh yeah um yeah it makes things other than melatonin that's for sure yeah and I think it's kind of elusive but I think there's something to it and I say that having used a lot of panon with people over the years and having very similar respons mon es um which is awesome like everyone knows like you said when you sleep better your entire day is better when you sleep better your life is better like exponentially better I think of the millions of people that suffer from lack of rap and eye movement sleep the lack of neuroplasticity that can be the consequence of that the lack of um healthy removal of uh emotional labels on previous day memories that is the consequence of REM deprivation the enormous um impact on depression rates the enormous impact on pretty much every mental health issue is made worse by by lack of REM sleep so I I say or I raise this conversation about pinealon with um a little bit of trepidation because I do worry that on the one hand people will see it as a miracle drug that's not what we're talking about it has this effect but at the same time I okay I'll just say that you know there's another drug that was released recently um uh this is a FDA approved drug um in the category of sleep drugs called the Doras so it works a little differently it doesn't um push on the sleepiness system so to speak it um it suppresses the wakefulness system and the idea is that it's supposed to increase REM sleep okay was by name quic and things like that um I tried it it was a total disaster for me I fell asleep woke up 3 hours later couldn't fall back asleep I tried it with lower dosage it's extremely expensive as well so I'm going to piss off whoever makes cor Vivic I forget who makes it it was a complete disaster for me yeah um um pinealon has been incredible and here's what's really interesting about it to me is that it seems to improve my sleep on the nights when I don't take it which makes total sense if it indeed is providing some regeneration of the pine pinealocytes that make melatonin and other sense to me yeah so here we're talking about something that one could potentially pulse with now and again and get Improvement in sleep every night yes yeah wild yeah and it's I mean I think it's worth noting that you you also take care of your health on many other aspects and that's probably why you were sensitive to it but it worked really well for you right and some other people it's going to take longer you know if if they're you know having to work on their diet and having to work on their exercise and having to work on their thought patterns right we don't talk that about that enough having positive thoughts um but yeah it's and it's so safe we've never ever seen I mean I never ever have seen a side effect or negative side effect from pinealon it's and and your response has been uniform you know it people don't always get there as quickly but people get there with their sleep love it and so and you compound it with glycine yeah what's the rationale there I really like"}
{"question": "What role do the gut microbiota play in digestion and how can they be supported to improve overall health?", "doc_id": "15R2pMqU2ok_5", "video_id": "15R2pMqU2ok", "video_title": "How to Enhance Your Gut Microbiome for Brain & Overall Health", "video_header": "Roles of Gut Microbiome", "segment_idx": "5", "time_start": "20:01", "time_end": "23:01", "context": "So hopefully now you have some sense of the architecture of the digestive pathway and you have some sense of the trillions of little microbacteria that are living all along the different components of that digestive pathway. But what we haven't talked about yet, and what I'd like to talk about now, is what those little microbiota are actually doing in your digestive tract. In addition to just living there for their own intents and purposes, they are contributing, for instance, to your digestion. Many of the genes that those microbiota make are genes that are involved in fermentation and genes that are involved in digestion of particular types of nutrients. And in a little bit, we will talk about how what you eat can actually change the enzymes that those microbiome components make, enzymes largely being things that are responsible for digestion. They catalyze other sorts of cellular events but in the context of the digestive pathway, we're talking about enzymes that help digest your food. So those microbiota are indeed helping you in many ways. And if you lack certain microbiota that can help you digest, it stands to reason that you would have challenges digesting certain types of foods. The other amazing thing that these microbiota do is they change the way that your brain functions by way of metabolizing or facilitating the metabolism of particular neurotransmitters. So one of the ways that having certain microbiota present in your gut can improve your mood or degrade your mood, for instance, is by way of certain microbiota being converted into or facilitating the conversion of chemicals, such as GABA. GABA is what we call an inhibitory neurotransmitter. It's involved in suppressing the action of other neurons. And that might sound like a bad thing, but all types of sedatives, for instance, alcohol, and a lot of neurons that naturally make GABA can help quiet certain circuits in the brain, for instance, circuits responsible for anxiety. In people who have epilepsy, the GABAergic neurons, as they're called, can all often be disrupted in their signaling, meaning they're not cranking out as much GABA and therefore the excitatory neurons, which typically release other molecules like glutamate can engage in what's called runaway excitation and that can give rise to seizures. So the simple message here is that the microbiota by way of making neurochemicals can influence the way that your brain functions. So you want to support those microbiota and we will give you tools to support those microbiota. But the takeaway at this point is that those microbiota are making things locally to help digest food. Other microbiota are helping to make certain neurotransmitters like GABA, and we'll also talk about dopamine and serotonin. And so the very specific microbiota that reside in your gut have a profound influence on many, many biological functions, especially immune system function, brain function, and digestion. So that should give you a fairly complete picture of your gut microbiome."}
{"question": "What are the two main barriers that prevent environmental influences from being passed on to future generations, and how do epigenetics play a role in breaching or maintaining these barriers?", "doc_id": "CDUetQMKM6g_7", "video_id": "CDUetQMKM6g", "video_title": "Dr. Oded Rechavi: Genes & the Inheritance of Memories Across Generations | Huberman Lab Podcast", "video_header": "Weismann Barrier; Epigenetics", "segment_idx": "7", "time_start": "37:41", "time_end": "45:11", "context": "And aside from the dark cloud that these episodes left, there were also theoretical problems of why this can't happen, barriers that have to be breached for this to happen. And you can talk about many different types of barriers, and you can also narrow it down to two main barriers. First barrier, we mentioned it. This is the separation of the soma from the germline. Andrew Huberman: Right. The somatic cells, they can change in response to experience. The sperm and the egg, the so-called germ cells cannot. That's the idea. Oded Rechavi: Or they are isolated from what happens in the soma. Okay. The man who first thought about this barrier is called Wiseman, August Wiseman. This was in the 19th century, so it is called today the Wiseman Barrier, separation of the soma from the germline. Only the germline transmits information to the next generation. And this is also called the second law of biology. So this is very, very fundamental. So natural selection is the first one, this is the second one, because it's so important to how we work, to how our bodies work. Wiseman, by the way, thought that if you will have direct influence of the environment on the germ cells, then perhaps this could transfer to the next generation. So he wasn't as strict as his barriers suggest. But this is not how most people remember it. But he thought that this was unnecessary. It's possible that natural selection can explain everything. And he compared it to a boat, which is in the ocean, it is sailing and it has a sail open. So you don't have to assume that it has an engine. The wind is blowing. You don't have to assume other things. The natural selection might be enough. So this barrier is still standing, but not entirely. It is breached in some organisms. We'll go into that in a second. The other barrier is now we have to understand the other barrier. We have to talk about epigenetics. We have to define epigenetics and what it is. And epigenetics is another term which people misuse horribly and say about everything that is epigenetics. Even people from the fields. The word itself, that the term was defined in the 40s by Weddington, Conrad Weddington. And he talked about the interactions between genes and their products that, in the end, bring about the phenotype of the consequences and how genes influence development. Later, people discovered mechanisms that change the action of genes. There are different mechanisms and started talking about these as epigenetics. For example, DNA is built out of four basic elements. These are the A,T, G, and C, and they can be chemically modified. So in addition to just the information that you have in the sequence of the DNA, you also have the information in the modification of the bases. The most common modification that has been studied more than others is modification of the letter C of cytosine methylation, the addition of a metal group to this C, and this can be replicated. So after the cells divide and replicate their genetic material, in certain cases also, these chemical modifications can be added on and replicate and be preserved. Andrew Huberman: For those who aren't as familiar with thinking about genes and gene structure and epigenetics, could we think of these? You mentioned the four nucleotide bases, C, G, A, T, but could we imagine that through things like methylation, it's sort of like taking the primary colors and changing one of them a little bit, changing the hue just slightly, which then opens up an enormous number of new options of color integration. Oded Rechavi: It's just more combinations, more ways, more information. There are the modifications of the DNA, and also there are the modifications of the proteins which condense the DNA that are called histones. So they are also modified by many different chemicals. Again, methylation is a very common modification. Acetylation, even serotonin, serotoninlation of histones. Andrew Huberman: Serotonin, right. Oded Rechavi: This is a new paper from nature. Andrew Huberman: From a few years ago, can change. Oded Rechavi: DNA, not the DNA itself, but the protein that condenses it, essentially. Andrew Huberman: How, in the analogy I used before, of how the thread is wrapped around the spool, essentially? Oded Rechavi: Yes, a nd this determines the degree of condensation of the DNA, whether the gene is now more or less accessible, and therefore can perhaps be expressed more or less. This is one way to affect the gene expression and bring about the function of the gene. There are many additional ways, not the only one. So then, when all of this was starting to be elucidated, people talked about epigenetics, they started talking about these modifications, forgot the original definition. And when people said epigenetics, they talk about methylation and things like that. Andrew Huberman: And again, to just frame this up so we could imagine two identical twins, so called monozygotic twins, we could go a step further and say that they're monochorionic and they were in the same placental sac, because twins can be raised in separate Sacs, slightly different early environments. Let's say those two twins are raised separately. One experiences certain things, the other things, they eat different foods, etc. And there is the possibility, through epigenetic mechanisms, that through methylation, acetylation, serotonin production, etc., that the expression of certain genes in one of the twins could be amplified relative to the other, correct? Oded Rechavi: Yeah. So we know that even totally identical twins, genetically, they're identical, but they look different, and they are different. We all experience it. And this can happen because of these epigenetic changes, or it can happen because of other mechanisms, because genes respond to the environment. Genes don't exist in a vacuum. Genes need to be activated by transcription factors, and there's a lot of machinery that is responsible for making genes function. So we are a combination of our genetic material and the environment. So when people talk about epigenetics and talk just about the modification, they're also not exactly right. My definition of epigenetics is inheritance, which occurs either across cell division or more interestingly, also for this podcast, now across generations, not because of changes to the DNA sequence, but through other mechanisms. I think this is the most robust definition that allows you to understand what you're talking about. And then the question is, if this happens, then what are the molecules that actually transmit information across generations? Are they these chemical modifications to the DNA or to the proteins that condense the DNA? Or are there other agents that transmit the information and which molecules can do it? And I actually think that the most interesting players today are RNA molecules. But before I go into that, I just want to say that when we talk about the barriers to epigenetic inheritance or the barriers to inheritance of acquired"}

Some people just have stable blood sugar. They can go long periods of time without eating and feel fine. Other people get really shaky, really jittery, and/or when they do eat, they feel really keyed up. Sometimes they'll even sweat. Sometimes their vision will go blurry. And some of that can actually be because they've become hyperglycemic. And those effects that you experience when you are hyperglycemic are the early warning signs of the kinds of things that damage neurons and lead to the really terrible stuff they talked about before like peripheral neuropathies. Now, it takes some time for those things to occur, those neuropathies to occur. But whether or not your blood sugar is all over the place or whether or not stable, can be impacted by a number of things. One of those things is exercise. So these days there's a lot of interest in what they call zone two cardio, which is that kind of steady state cardio, where you can just nasal breathe even at pretty high output, where you could maybe have a conversation. Although I'm such a huge proponent of nasal breathing during exercise, most forms of exercise especially zone two cardio, that you probably shouldn't be talking while you're doing that cardio unless it's absolutely essential. But periods of zone two cardio that lasts anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour or sometimes more for your endurance athletes, can create positive effects on blood sugar regulation, such that you people can sit down and enjoy whatever it is, the hot fudge sundae, or whatever the high sugar content food is. And blood glucose management is so good. Your insulin sensitivity is so high, which is a good thing, that you can manage that blood glucose to the point where it doesn't really make you shaky, it doesn't disrupt you. And you know, to say nothing of the weight-related issues or the adipose fat gain, et cetera, that's a separate issue because people vary there. But basically doing zone two cardio for 30 to 60 minutes, three to four times a week makes your blood sugar really stable, and that's an attractive thing for a variety of reasons."}

about the sleep so we looked at their sleep physiology and what we found were two interesting components first it seemed to be related to that lighter form of stage two nonrem sleep I told you that textbook memory requires deep non-rem sleep stages three and four casting back to episode one motor memory more dependent on stage two and those beautiful spindles that are the Hallmark of beginning your stage two the more of those that you had the greater the memory benefit the next day we then wanted to say well is this effect simply something to do with the nighttime because that's the other hypothesis it's not really about sleep it's just something about night ESS because in all of the studies i' described so far they're all happening at night and at night they were sleeping so is it really nighttime or is it specifically sleep so now we did a nap study with motor skill learning we repeated that and sure enough even though that time period was across the day not during night n they showed this beautiful motor skill benefit if they napped versus if they did not and then in that naps City I was telling you that they were learning the sequence with the um right non-dominant hand and they were all we selected all right handers to to make it equal and they were typing 41324 41324 and that right hand as well you know is controlled by the left motor cortex so after in the nap study when we recorded their sleep we used very high density EEG so lots and lots of sensors on top of the head so we could map with High Fidelity resolution the surface of the brain or the surface of the scalp and infer what's going on in the brain and what was interesting is that yes those sleep spindles the more of them that you had in the nap the better your motor skill learning was but there seemed to be a lateralized effect such that the Sleep spindle activity on the right side of the brain which controls the left hand which was not working that showed no spindle increased in activity however on the right hand activity that invoked activation in the left motor cortex that left motor cortex and specifically Al the hand region showed a local increase in spindle activity and subsequent work and work prior to our had demonstrated that it's not sleep physiology globally it's almost as though your sleep physiology responds to the mapping of the memory in the brain wherever the memory is that's where sleep when you go to sleep sort of starts massaging the cortex so that you get that plasticity it's almost like a good masseuse you know you sort of sit down they say where are your problem points and you say it's it's here and here and so they don't give you a general massage they go to work on the regions that have been working hardest that require greatest attention sleep does that it's a amazing and reminds me of some of this work that was done I think in the late 90s early 2000s Richard Morris and um colleagues over in I think he was in Edinburgh um talked about synaptic tagging you know this notion that animals or humans perform or learn some new motor skill maybe navigation of a novel environment maybe a motor skill of the 41234 that you described you know keys on a piano or something like that and then it was acknowledged that the the changes in the connections between neurons don't occur immediately which meant that there had to be some sort of tag or label to the synapsis that marked them for consolidation later for plasticity long-term potentiation things of that sort the names don't really matter um I think later it became clear based on Marcus Frank's work and others that indeed during sleep the hard rewiring of the nervous system occurs plasticity occurs but what you're saying is that there's a high degree of specificity meaning the specific circuits that were active and required for the learning are the specific circuits that are modified which on the face of it one could say well of course what that means is that during sleep the brain is um somehow able to uh the neurons of the brain that is are able to chemically or electrically or both signal like this is where that there needs to be some modifications done and then then like a night crew um the the brain self- induces its own changes which is remarkable it really is it's almost as though there are red flags that are planted in the territories that have undergone learning dependent plasticity and they are calling out almost like you know hungry mouths that are in plasticity famine for the feast relief that comes by way of sleep do we know what the factors are that are released in sleep that allow that to occur or is it I'm guessing there are many people love to talk about brain derived neutrophic Factor bdnf but which is a very interesting molecule but um it's probably just one of a panoply of of molecules that are that are important we we don't know necessarily the neurochemical processes although some people have manipulated plasticity and then blocked it with different types of nmda which is a certain type of receptor in the brain for excitatory activity which is the underlying basis of brain plasticity so that certainly is dependent but what's interesting about the sleep spindles I said in the first episode that they burst somewhere between about 12 to 15 times per second if you apply that type of stimulation to a particular neuronal circuit within the brain that seems to be one of the and it's not the only but one of the ideal sort of Sweet Spot tickling of neurons that forces them to say oh I think I should strengthen this circuit so it's almost as though these sleep spindles are ideally designed at the frequency at the sort of tickling level of neurons to stimulate exactly what we think is the underlying basis of strengthening a memory which is at the level of the neurons the strengthening of synapses so interesting um because we hear this fire together wire together high frequency transmission between neurons is what creates plasticity but this is literally a replay of previously meaning earlier that day or the previous day as you pointed out activity in the given circuit being replayed not unlike the the the work that you talked about earlier the fast replay of neurons in in the hippocampus but here it's not necessarily just in the hippocampus it can be in the neocortex or other structures that then builds up the uh the the Vigor with which that circuit can function in the daytime AKA learning um is it's super interesting you mentioned that this is occurring largely in stage two of sleep not in

{"question": "What are some of the benefits and practices of meditation that Dr. Sam Harris emphasized, and how can they help shift one's engagement with the world and oneself?", "doc_id": "-wIt_WsJGfw_0", "video_id": "-wIt_WsJGfw", "video_title": "Dr. Sam Harris: Using Meditation to Focus, View Consciousness & Expand Your Mind | Huberman Lab 105", "video_header": "Dr. Sam Harris", "segment_idx": "0", "time_start": "0:00", "time_end": "4:35", "context": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today my guest is Dr. Sam Harris. Dr. Sam Harris did his undergraduate training in philosophy at Stanford University and then went on to do his doctorate in neuroscience at the University of California at Los Angeles. He is well known as an author who has written about everything from meditation to consciousness, free will. And he holds many strong political views that he's voiced on social media and in the content of various books as they relate to philosophy and neuroscience. During today's episode, I mainly talk to Dr. Harris about his views and practices related to meditation, consciousness, and free will. In fact, he made several important points about what a proper meditation practice can accomplish. Prior to this episode, I thought that meditation was about deliberately changing one's conscious experience in order to achieve things such as deeper relaxation, a heightened sense of focus or ability to focus generally, elevated memory, and so on. What Sam taught me and what you'll soon learn as well is that while meditation does indeed hold all of those valuable benefits, the main value of a meditation practice, or perhaps the greater value of a meditation practice, is that it doesn't just allow one to change their conscious experience, but it actually can allow a human being to view consciousness itself. That is to understand what the process of consciousness is. And in doing so, to profoundly shift the way that one engages with the world and with oneself in all practices, all environments, and at all times, both in sleep and in waking states. And in that way making meditation perhaps the most potent and important portal by which one can access novel ways of thinking and being and viewing one's life experience. We also discussed the so-called mind-body problem and issues of duality and free will. Concepts from philosophy and neuroscience that, fortunately, thanks to valuable experiments and deep thinking on the part of people like Dr. Sam Harris and others, is now leading people to understand really what free will is and isn't. Where the locus of free will likely sits in the brain, if it indeed resides in the brain at all. And what it means to be a conscious being and how we can modify our conscious states in ways that allow us to be more functional. We also discuss perception, both visual perception auditory perception, and especially interesting to me, and I think as well, hopefully to you, time perception, which we know is very elastic in the brain. The literal frame rate by which we process our conscious experience can expand and contract dramatically depending on our state of mind and how conscious we are about our state of mind. So we went deep into that topic as well. Today's discussion was indeed an intellectual deep dive into all the topics that I mentioned a few moments ago, but it also included many practical tools. In fact, I pushed Sam to share with us what his specific practices are and how we can all arrive at a clearer and better understanding of a meditation practice that we can each and all apply. So that we can derive these incredible benefits, not just the ones related to stress and focus and enhanced memory, but the ones that relate to our consciousness. That is to our deeper sense of self and to others. Several times during today's episode, I mentioned the Waing Up app. The Waking Up app was developed by Sam Harris, but I want to emphasize that my mention of the app is in no way a paid promotional. Rather the Waking Up app is one that I've used for some period of time now and find very, very useful. I have family members that also use it. Other staff members here at the Huberman Lab podcast use it because we find it to be such a powerful tool. Sam has generously offered Huberman Lab podcast listeners a 30-day completely free trial of the Waking Up app. If any of you want to try it, you can simply go to wakingup.com/huberman to get that 30-day free trial. During today's discussion, we didn't just talk about meditation consciousness and free will. We also talked about psychedelics. Both their therapeutic applications for the treatment of things like depression and PTSD, but also the use of psychedelics. And we discussed Sam's experiences with psychedelics as they relate to expanding one's consciousness. I also asked Sam about his views and practices related to social media. Prompted in no small part by his recent voluntary decision to close down his Twitter account. So we talked about his rationale for doing that, how he feels about doing that. And I think you'll find that to be very interesting as well. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research"}
{"question": "Can I experiment with caffeine to find out how much I can safely consume in the evening without disrupting my sleep?", "doc_id": "nm1TxQj9IsQ_3", "video_id": "nm1TxQj9IsQ", "video_title": "Master Your Sleep & Be More Alert When Awake", "video_header": "Caffeine: Devil & Angel", "segment_idx": "3", "time_start": "9:01", "time_end": "12:16", "context": "Now, I'm not here to demonize caffeine, I love caffeine, and I drink it in the morning and I drink it in the afternoon, but I'm one of these people that, either because of my tolerance or because of some genetic variations that exist among people in terms of their adenosine receptors, I can drink caffeine as late as 4:00 or 5:00 p.m. in the evening and still fall asleep just fine. Some people can't have any caffeine at all or can't have any caffeine past 11:00 a.m. or else their sleep is totally disrupted. All of this has to do with the relationship between adenosine and these adenosine receptors, genetic variation, things that are very hard to find out except experimentally, meaning each of you needs to decide and figure out for yourselves whether or not you can tolerate caffeine and at what times of day you can tolerate caffeine in order to still fall asleep easily and get good sleep, so rather than demonize caffeine, or say that everyone can drink caffeine until late, you need to figure out what's right for you. Caffeine has a lot of health benefits, it also, for some people, can be problematic for health, it can raise blood pressure, et cetera, caffeine increases this molecule that's a neuromodulator that we call dopamine, we discussed this in episode one, which tends to make us feel good, motivated, and give us energy because, as you may have learned in episode one, dopamine is related to another neuromodulator called epinephrine, which gives us energy, in fact, epinephrine is made from dopamine. So let's just take a step back and think about what we're talking about when we're talking about sleepiness, sleepiness is driven by increases in adenosine that happen naturally, caffeine prevents the adenosine from having its action of making us sleepy by blocking that receptor, so it gives us energy and it increases our dopamine levels, but some people can't tolerate caffeine very well, other people can tolerate it just fine, so you need to determine that experimentally. All the data say there's tremendous variation, and right now, the only way that I'm aware of for you to decide whether or not caffeine is a good or a bad thing for you, and whether or not you should ingest it at a given time of day or at all is really to figure that out on your own, in fact, there's a small subset of people that can drink caffeine until very late and they have no trouble falling asleep because they actually have a mutant form of the adenosine receptor, so in keeping with the theme of science and science-related tools, this is one of those cases where I can't give you a one-size-fits-all prescription except to say you need to experiment with caffeine in a way that's safe for you and explore that and figure out what works for you, and then stick with that. Okay, so adenosine is driving this sleep hunger, when adenosine is low, it's like we're well-fed, we're not very hungry, and when adenosine is high, it's like we're fasted for a long time and we tend to be very hungry, so that when adenosine is high, we really wanna fall asleep. If you want, I'm not suggesting you do this experiment, but you can do it, you can stay up for four more hours than you're used to staying up and you'll find that you're very, very sleepy. That's because adenosine is building up at levels higher and higher because you've been awake for those extra four hours. However, if you've ever pulled an all-nighter, you'll notice something interesting, as morning rolls around, you'll suddenly feel an increase"}
{"question": "Is it healthier to eat during the daytime, especially during my most active hours, rather than at night?", "doc_id": "9tRohh0gErM_8", "video_id": "9tRohh0gErM", "video_title": "Effects of Fasting & Time Restricted Eating on Fat Loss & Health | Huberman Lab Podcast #41", "video_header": "Feeding Deep Into the Night Is Bad (In Humans)", "segment_idx": "8", "time_start": "31:26", "time_end": "36:26", "context": "an important point about when the feeding window falls within the 24 hour cycle, it is very important that the feeding window fall during the more active phase of one's day, so for humans, that's typically in the early part of the day or the later part of the day, but not at night, put very simply, there are a lot of data now pointing to the fact that eating during the nocturnal phase of the 24 hour cycle is very detrimental to one's health. In fact, when we eat can either enhance our health or can diminish our health. When we see light can enhance our feelings of wellbeing or can diminish our feelings of wellbeing. I've talked many times before about this, on the human lab podcast, that during the daytime, you want to get as much sunlight and other types of bright light in your eyes as safely possible. And then you want to avoid light in the middle of the night. It has detrimental dopamine lowering effects can cause depression, cortisol increases, et cetera. So when you view light is as important as the light that you view. And when you eat is as important as what you eat, in this study, they saw something really interesting, which was that not only did restricting food to a particular phase of the 24 hour cycle benefit, things like lean body mass and fat loss and a number of health parameters that we'll talk about in a moment, but it also anchored all the gene systems of the body and provided a more regular stable so-called circadian rhythm or 24 hour rhythm, you may be surprised to learn that 80%, 80% of the genes in your body and brain are on a 24 hour schedule. That is they change their levels going from high to low and back to high again, across the 24 hour cycle. And when those genes are high at the appropriate times and low at the appropriate times, meaning their expression is high and low at the appropriate times. And therefore the proper RNAs and proteins are made because DNA codes for RNA, RNA is translated into proteins. When that happens, your health benefits, when those genes are not expressed at the right times when they're higher or low at the wrong times of each 24 hour cycle, that's when you get negative health effects. This study showed that when mice restrict their eating to an eight hour period within the most active phase of their 24 hour cycle, many of the genes that are associated with these so-called circadian clocks, these genes have names like PER, BMAL, CRY1, et cetera, those so-called clock genes underwent a very regular entrainment, a locking in to the proper 24 hour schedule. And while this was in mice, we now know that this also occurs in humans, I've said before on this podcast, and I'll say it again, that light, and when we view light is the primary way in which these genes and the clock systems of our body get organized or entrained, meaning matched to the outside light dark cycle. So viewing light early in the day and in the afternoon, and as much as possible all day, great, ideally that sunlight, avoiding light in the middle of the night is also great. It's great because it causes the increases in particular genes and the decreases in particular genes in every cell throughout your body at the appropriate times, the second most powerful timekeeper or zeitgeber, as it's called, is food, and when you eat, and in this study, the results they saw underscore this point, what they saw is that the peaks in these clock genes became very regular. And the dips in these clock genes became very regular. And that led to a whole host of really important, positive health effects. Conversely, when mice ate, whenever they wanted across the 24 hour cycle, these clock genes became really out of whack and the negative health consequences were the downstream result of these changes in these clock genes. This is now also been shown to be true for humans. So if you want to be healthy, you want your organ health, your metabolic health to be in trained properly. One of the most important things you can do is to, if you lied at the appropriate times of each 24 hour schedule and to not view light at other times of that schedule and to eat at the appropriate time of each 24 hour day. Now, again, there are rare instances that we will discuss when skipping entire days or entire 24 hour cycles of eating can be beneficial. But for now we're talking about schedules of time restricted feeding involve a window of feeding that falls during your more active phase, so during the daytime, putting aside people that work shift work during the daytime is when you want to eat. And this eight hour feeding window provided a very strong reinforcing signal that combines with light to ensure that these genes are expressed at the appropriate times. The short takeaway from this is you probably want to think about and perhaps even engage in time, restricted feeding."}

"time_start": "34:17", "time_end": "40:49", "context": "huberman okay so given that context is a powerful modifier of the placebo effect and in fact may be Central to the placebo effect I just want to Rattle off of few of the known Placebo effects that have been demonstrated which show the extent to which your brain and my brain are coming up with ideas about what given drugs or given behavioral treatments ought to do and in that way shaping what happens when you take a placebo or and this is an idea that we'll go into in a bit more detail in a few minutes perhaps context is also changing the way that active drugs not placebos but active drugs are impacting your brain and body the examples i' like to give our from laboratory studies about the placebo effect but that relate to very common at home and normal life scenarios okay they are not unique to the laboratory and they are the following first of all Placebo effects are strongly modifiable by the expectation of the quality of a given treatment for instance if you are given a placebo that has a brand name on it or a name of a drug it could even be a madeup name you don't know what the drug does does but it has trademark TM there in the corner of the name so brand name as opposed to generic Placebo the brand name Placebo has a stronger effect moreover if a placebo is placed into a package not just put in front of you on a little tray or in a little dish but rather in a package where you have to push it through that little foil wrapping or you have to take it out of a bottle and especially if that wrapping or bottle has a label on it or it looks as if it's a quote unquote real drug well then the placebo has an even greater placebo effect the color of a given drug can even have an effect based on our association or expectation of what different colors relate to in terms of our physiology for instance if subjects are given pills that they are told will help them fall and stay asleep and some subjects are given blue pills other subjects are given Red pills other subjects are given yellow pills the subjects that take the blue pills tend to sleep better even though all the pills regardless of color are Placebo they contain no active substance okay so for some reason most people associate the color blue with sleep whereas or I should say by contrast if people are given a blue a red or a yellow pill and they are told it's a stimulant the subjects taking the red pill here I mean the actual literal red pill I'm not talking about any kind of cultural red pill I haven't seen The Matrix yet people tell me I need to see it but I'm not talking about taking the red pill quote unquote I'm talking about taking a pill that is the color red in an experiment the people that take that pill experience a greater Placebo induced stimulant effect as opposed to when subjects take a blue or a yellow pill for some reason the color red is associated with a quote unquote upper effect or stimulant effect moreover if subjects are given a blue a red or a yellow pill and they are told that the pill will have an anti- depressant effect the subjects that took the yellow Placebo get the biggest anti-depressant effect so color of a given pill even impacts the direction or in this case the magnitude of the placebo effect and I should mention that in every one of those studies yes there was information about what the given pill should do it was not the case that if people took the red pill they felt a stimulant effect if they took a blue pill they felt a sleepy effect and if they took the yellow pill they felt an anti-depressant effect these were three separate experiments one on sleep where subjects were given one of the three colors of pills blue had the strongest effect or a study of stimulant effects they were told it's a study pills that will increase alertness and attention they were given one of three different colors the red pills had the biggest effect and the third experiment subjects were told this is a pill that will alleviate to some degree your symptoms of depression the people who took the yellow pill experienced the greatest relief of depressive symptoms now that's pretty wild but what perhaps is even Wild ER is the more invasive a placebo intervention is the greater the placebo effect so capsules have a bigger effect than tablets I don't know if that's more invasive but I guess it looks more medicinal to have a capsule versus a tablet who knows why but that's what's been observed an injection of a placebo has a greater effect than a consumption of a capsule or a tablet of course and if people are placed into a medical device or machine especially in cases where one of their limbs or both of their limbs or even their whole body is placed into a device even though the device is doing absolutely nothing specifically to our biological system it is inert right a bunch of buttons and a bunch of noises and a bunch of humming as if something were happening but nothing is happening that directly relates to any one specific biological system except and now you know what I'm about to say except expectation of what the machine is doing well that has the greatest placebo effect of all so for some reason as the level of invasiveness or the let's just say the complexity of a given treatment is increased well then the magnitude of the placebo effect is also increased and what this tells us is that the human brain has come to associate level of invasiveness level of complexity of a given treatment or machine to equate to bigger outcomes and in some sense that's completely logical but again we have to remember in absolutely zero of these conditions whether or not it's a tablet a capsule an injection or a medical device is there anything being done to these human subjects that impacts a specific biological function except one and that one again is the activation of specific neural circuits in the prefrontal cortex that then are able to communicate with other areas of the brain and body through Bonafide biological mechanisms of neurotransmitter release and electrical activity in neurons this is what the brain does and of course the prefrontal cortex being part of the brain those are the mechanisms it employs to change the activity of hormone relasing glands to change the activity of other neurons in other words the belief effects the expectations are real they are having effects through true biological circuitry it's just that the pills and the treatments and the machines are not doing anything specific at all except activating expectation so

{"question": "How long should I try to focus before taking a break or switching tasks?", "doc_id": "yb5zpo5WDG4_7", "video_id": "yb5zpo5WDG4", "video_title": "Focus Toolkit: Tools to Improve Your Focus & Concentration | Huberman Lab Podcast #88", "video_header": "Warm-Up for Cognitive Work, Refocusing Attention & Neuroplasticity", "segment_idx": "7", "time_start": "22:55", "time_end": "26:13", "context": "This is a really key point. A lot of people are challenged with getting into a mode of focus. None of us, however, should be expected to just sit down and drop directly into a state of focus. I think that's completely an unfair request of ourselves. I mean, for instance, you wouldn't expect yourself to go out on the track or go out for a run and not warm up. You might jog for a few minutes or even walk before you would jog and then jog before you would run, right, I would hope you would do that. And if you're doing resistance training, I doubt that you go over and load up the bar or the machine with the maximum amount of weight that you can move and then just drop right into that, you always do a warmup. And I think it's very important to understand mental work, focus and concentration as requiring that warmup. What is that warmup? Well, you know what that warmup is. That warmup is the ramping up or the increase of epinephrine, adrenaline, acetylcholine, and dopamine. Right, the way that neurochemicals work is we don't just get to flip switches in our brain because we decide to, that's a fantasy. That's sort of the \"Limitless\" movie or movies and ideas that suddenly you're going to flip a switch on your arm and all of a sudden you're going to be in a laser focus, that is just not the way that your nervous system works. There's a gradual dropping into any state, whether or not that state is sleep, right, you go from shallow sleep to deep sleep and then out eventually. Focus too, you go from shallow focus to increasingly deep focus. That is, in our metaphor of the arrow, it's very broad, it's pointed at a lot of things. And over time as we drop into focus, that arrow is narrowing and narrowing and narrowing. In fact, probably better to think about it narrowing and then sometimes oscillating and getting wider again. We might hear something down the hallway or more typically our phone will buzz or we'll think, oh, I wonder what so and so is doing or I had to contact them about something. Your focus is dynamic, it is not what we call a step function. It's not like you go from unfocused to focused and then you drop into your maximal focus. By understanding that it's dynamic, by understanding that you are going to be continually going in and out of progressively but varying levels of focus, you will greatly release the pressure on yourself to feel focused all the time when you want to be. This is very key. People who are very good at focusing understand this and understand that they can't expect themselves to just immediately focus and then snap into or out of focus. Okay so be patient with yourself and also understand that focus is an ability, that you can improve your ability to focus by engaging the neural circuits responsible for focus repeatedly over time through so-called neuroplasticity, the ability of your nervous system to change in response to experience. And that has a couple of different components, but put very simply, what we repeat gets etched into our nervous system and becomes easier over time. And the more emotionally important or vital something feels to us, the more likely it is to trigger neuroplasticity. We're going to talk a little bit more about how to increase neural circuits for focus later, but right now, what you have in hand is the key importance of sleep and I again will direct you to hubermanlab.com and the Neural Network Newsletter to really work on optimizing your sleep. We've also got two auditory sound based tools for improving focus, there's 40 HZ binaural beats used before or during bouts of focus and concentration.

{"question": "How much creatine should I supplement daily to potentially experience cognitive benefits, especially if I'm not consuming meat sources of creatine?", "doc_id": "E7W4OQfJWdw_10", "video_id": "E7W4OQfJWdw", "video_title": "Nutrients For Brain Health & Performance | Huberman Lab Podcast #42", "video_header": "Creatine for Cognition (Tool 5: 5g/day)", "segment_idx": "10", "time_start": "32:28", "time_end": "36:23", "context": "Creatine can be derived from meat sources. It can also be supplemented. Some of you are probably familiar with creatine or have heard about creatine from the context of the health and fitness world, where creatine is used to bring more water into muscles, which can enhance the strength of those muscles, as well as bring water into other tissues. It doesn't just draw more water into muscle, it can draw more water into the body generally. Creatine has also been shown to have an important role in brain function. And once again, this is something that came up during the discussion about depression a few episodes back. Creatine can actually be used as a fuel source in the brain. And there's some evidence that it can enhance the function of certain frontal cortical circuits that feed down onto, or rather, connect to, areas of the brain that are involved in mood regulation and motivation. And that's where creatine plays a role in depression, or rather, where creatine supplementation seems to be able to assist in some forms of mild depression. That's an emerging literature. It's still not well-established. However, there is now ample evidence that creatine supplementation can enhance brain function in certain contexts. And if you're interested in learning more about what those contexts are, there's an excellent review that just came out. The first author is Roschel, R-O-S-C-H-E-L. We will provide a link to this study, rather, this review, excuse me, in the caption. This was published just very recently in 2021. And one thing to make clear, is that creatine supplementation has been shown to be especially useful for people that are not consuming any meat or other sources of foods that are rich in creatine. What is the threshold level of creatine to supplement in order to get the cognitive benefit? It appears to be at least five grams per day. Now, the most typical form of creatine is so-called creatine monohydrate. There are other forms of creatine as well, some of which are thought to not draw as much water into non-muscle tissues, and for some people, that's attractive to them. They don't want water sitting below their skin, et cetera. I should emphasize, that the responses to creatine in that sense can differ. Some people get a little bit of water retention. Some people experience more. There's some evidence that creatine can impact some of the hormonal pathways, that it might enhance levels of so-called dihydrotestosterone, DHT, and therefore, because DHT is involved in hair loss, there are these theories that creatine can cause hair loss. And indeed, for people that are very DHT sensitive, it might. There's going to be a lot of variation person to person in terms of how much creatine impacts DHT, and how many DHT receptors they have on their scalp, and therefore, whether or not they experience hair loss. I'm just giving you all this information, so that you're aware of the various things that creatine can do. But nonetheless, I think it's interesting that creatine supplementation of five grams per day, that's creatine monohydrate, has been shown to improve cognition in people that aren't getting creatine from animal sources. And there's some evidence detailed within the review that I just described, that creatine supplementation can also enhance cognition in people that are also eating animal products. So I personally take creatine five grams per day, and have for a very long time. I can't say that I've noticed a tremendous benefit, because I've actually never really come off it, and so I've never done the control experiment. I take it more as kind of a baseline insurance policy. For me, I'm probably losing, I'm certainly losing some of my hair. Whether or not that's due to creatine or not, I've never done the analysis. But what I can say is that, I generally consume these things like EPAs, creatine, alpha-GPC to set a general context of support for my neurons, for my brain. And, of course, I also pay attention to the foods that contain these various compounds. So I don't actively eat additional meat just to obtain creatine. I eat a fairly limited amount of meat. I don't restrict it,"}

That's actually the reason I started taking it and the reason I still take it once or twice a day. It essentially covers all of my nutritional bases. And the probiotics in particular are important to me because of the critical importance of what's called the gut-brain axis, that is neurons and other cell types in the gut, in the digestive tract, that communicate with the brain and the brain back to the digestive tract in order to control things like mood, immune function, hormone function, and on and on.

{"question": "What are the different ways the body can convert carbohydrates, fats, and other nutrients into ATP, the primary energy source for the body?", "doc_id": "VQLU7gpk_X8_5", "video_id": "VQLU7gpk_X8", "video_title": "How to Build Endurance in Your Brain & Body", "video_header": "Energy; Many Paths To ATP: Creatine, Glucose, Glycogen, Fat; Ketones", "segment_idx": "5", "time_start": "14:38", "time_end": "17:56", "context": "So the key thing to understand about energy production in the body, meaning your ability to think, your ability to talk, your ability to walk, your ability to run is this thing that we call ATP. ATP and mitochondria, which are just little what we call organelles within cells. These little factories that make energy, if you will. ATP is required for anything that requires energy, for anything that you do that requires effort. And there are different ways to get ATP. And we have been gifted as a species with the ability to convert lots of things into ATP. We can convert carbohydrates, literally the kinds of carbohydrates eat a bagel, you eat a piece of pizza. Pizza usually is dough, and it has cheese and some other things. Costello hears me talking about pizza. Costello loves pizza, by the way. Eating a piece of pizza, it gets converted into various things, fatty acids from the fats, glucose from the bread, and those things get converted into ATP within cells, through things like like glycolysis, things like lipolysis. I talked about this in previous episodes. So our muscles and our neurons use different fuel sources to generate ATP. The ones that are used first for short bouts of intense activity are things like phosphocreatine. If you've only heard about creatine as a supplement. Well, phosphocreatine actually exists on our muscles, and that's why people take creatine. You can load your muscles with more creatine. And though, and excuse me. Phosphocreatine is great for short, intense bouts of effort. So when you're really pushing hard on something physical, let's say you see a car on the side of the road and that car is stalled and a person says, \"Hey, can you help me push my car?\" And you start to push. That's going to be phosphocreatine is going to be your main fuel source. Then you start to tap into things like glucose which is literally just carbohydrate is the sugar that's in your blood. And then if you keep pushing on that car, you keep engaging in a particular effort, or you keep studying or you keep listening to this podcast, you start to tap into other fuel sources like glycogen from your liver, which is just, it's like a little pack, just like you might have packed a sandwich or something for work. You have a little pack of glycogen in your liver that you can rely on. And you have fat stored in adipose tissue. Even if you have very, very low body fat percentage like you're one of these people as like 3% or 5% body fat really thin skin, very little body fat, you can extract lipids fatty acids from that body fat. It's like a storage pack, it is a storage pack for energy that can be converted to ATP. So without going into any more detail, when I say today energy or I say ATP, just remember that regardless of your diet, regardless of your nutritional plan, your body has the capacity to use creatine, glucose, glycogen, lipids. And if you're ketogenic, ketones. We'll talk about ketosis. In order to generate fuel, energy. Now, the other crucial point is that, in order to complete that process of taking these fuels"}
{"question": "What inspired Dr. Lex Fridman to deliberately immerse himself in the geopolitical environment of Ukraine to gain a deeper understanding of the region and its people?", "doc_id": "6I5I56uVvLw_0", "video_id": "6I5I56uVvLw", "video_title": "Dr Lex Fridman: Navigating Conflict, Finding Purpose & Maintaining Drive | Huberman Lab Podcast #100", "video_header": "Dr. Lex Fridman", "segment_idx": "0", "time_start": "0:00", "time_end": "4:29", "context": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a Professor of Neurobiology and Ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is Dr. Lex Fridman Dr. Lex Fridman is an expert in electrical and computer engineering, artificial intelligence, and robotics. He is also the host of the Lex Fridman Podcast, which initially started as a podcast focus on technology and science of various kinds, including computer science and physics, but rapidly evolved to include guests and other topics as a matter of focus, including sport. For instance, Dr. Lex Freedman is a Black Belt in Brazilian jujitsu. And he's had numerous guests on who come from the fields of Brazilian jujitsu, both from the coaching side and from the competitor side. He also has shown an active interest in topics such as chess and essentially anything that involves intense activation and engagement of the mind and/or body. In fact, the Lex Fridman podcast has evolved to take on very difficult topics such as mental health-- he's had various psychiatrists and other guests on that relate to mental health and mental illness, as well as guest focused on geopolitics and some of the more controversial issues that face our times. He's had comedians, he's had scientists, he's had friends, he's had enemies on his podcast. Lex has a phenomenal, I would say a 1 in an eight billion ability to find these people, make them comfortable, and in that comfort, both try to understand them and to confront them and to push them so that we all learn. All of which is to say that Lex Fridman is no longer just an accomplished scientist, he certainly is that. But he has also become one of the more preeminent thought leaders on the planet. And if there's anything that really captures the essence of Lex Fridman, it's his love of learning, his desire to share with us, the human experience, and to broaden that experience so that we all may benefit. In many ways, our discussion during today's episode captures the many facets of Lex Fridman, although no conversation, of course, could capture them all. We sit down to the conversation just days after Lex returned from Ukraine, where he deliberately placed himself into the tension of that environment in order to understand the geopolitics of the region and to understand exactly what was happening at the level of the ground and the people there. You may notice that he carries quite a lot of both, emotion and knowledge and understanding. And yet in a very classic Lex Fridman way, you'll notice that he's able to zoom out of his own experience around any number of different topics and view them through a variety of lenses so that first of all, everyone feel included, but most of all, so that everyone learned something new, that is to gain new perspective. Our discussion also ventures into the waters of social media and how that landscape is changing the way that science and technology are communicated. We also get into the topics of motivation drive and purpose, both finding it and executing on that drive and purpose. I should mention that this is episode 100 of the Huberman Lab Podcast. And I would be remiss if I did not tell you that there would be no Huberman Lab Podcast, were it not for Lex Fridman. I was a fan of the Lex Fridman Podcast long before I was ever invited on to the podcast as a guest. And after our first recording, Lex was the one that suggested that I start a podcast. He only gave me two pieces of advice. The first piece of advice was, start a podcast. And the second piece of advice was that I not just make it me blabbing into the microphone and staring at the camera. So I can safely say that I at least followed half of his advice, and that I am ever grateful for Lex, both as a friend, a colleague in science, and now fellow podcaster for making the suggestion that we start this podcast. I already mentioned a few of the topics covered on today's podcast. But I can assure you that there is far more to the person that many of us know as Lex Fridman. If you are somebody interested in artificial intelligence, engineering, or robotics, today's discussion is most certainly for you. And if you are not, but you are somebody who is interested in world politics, and more importantly, the human experience, both the individual and the collective human experience, Lex shares what can only be described as incredible insights into what he views as the human experience and what is optimal in order to derive from our time on this planet. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford."}

it's a like a batch of neurons that then send a connection into the brain what what brain areas do they send to um and maybe we could describe these by name but also by function what what they generally resp are responsible for and uh probably should be prefaced with ultimately will go to the entire brain right everything ultimately connects to everything it's like Google Maps everything connects to everything but but what are some of the primary uh recipients of that information the um first hubs into of sensor integration are in the brain stem you know um and for instance the nucleus tractus solitarius is in a specific region within the the brain the Cal is one area and and NTS for those that don't know is involved in regulating hunger and appetite that's correct um other functions perhaps but like for instance um that seems to be an area of sensory integration for nutrients and when we say drives hunger or appetite sensory integration for nutrients I mean what would be great is if you know people could understand you know the the language of the nervous system is chemical and electrical so when these neurons are active um we tend to Crave certain foods you know seek them literally go to the refrigerator among the different choices go to that thing and select that and put it into our mouth so so presumably it's driving um reward systems motor systems I mean it um what we call hunger and appetite is really a kind of a a domino effect of a lot of different brain circuits do we know whether or not the um uh nucleus tractus solitus um projects to the areas of the brain involved in dopamine release and craving uh yes uh and there has been some elegant work uh from several different uh neuroscientists in this area like tracking the the circuitry uh from there onto many other uh different areas the hypothalamus for instance very basic behavioral fun functions um and the the stum where there is dopam dopamine release and then there is this pleasurable sensation and reward uh there is several other areas in there that are involved in this uh sensory integration uh there is quite a bit of work still to be done from specifically from uh the neurop pods there is like some evidence that they are connecting directly to um or there are if you put two papers together is obvious that there connecting to like some of these areas of dopamine release uh basal ganglia in the in the in the brain um and that's why they're causing this reinforcing uh effect like in the lateral hypothalamus and uh other other areas I do think that ultimately um there is quite a bit of a gap in like different regions of the digestive tract like we today we just talk about the esophagus right like the esophagus I think that is still there is a little bit of work uh perhaps I think that Steve liberis has worked in that in that area another great neuros scientist uh doing some uh very fine detailed work in sensory biology uh in esophagus uh there is quite a bit of Mis lack of uh precise biology in how it is that the esophagus specific cells of the esophagus are inated or like making sense of the environment and same thing for the stomach and how it is that ultimately each one of those regions are fitting into different regions of uh the brain uh even then how each one of these valves I'm fascinated by the each one of the valves that we talked earli on like um the gastroesophagal uh sphincter or the pyos or the oscal junction yeah we should um illustrate for people I'm not an expert in the gut by by any means but what Dr borquez is referring to is that you know the gut as it extends from the mouth to the rectum is not just a series of tubes of different uh diameters uh but rather they have valves Chambers and these sphincters that cut off you know everyone hears the word sphincter and they always think oh you know anal sphincter and then they ah you know it's like you know Elementary School uh Middle School humor but but sphincters are they they literally can close and open to varying extent um in order to allow um passage or prohibit passage from one compartment to the next such that the um certain things can take place over time in one one region like the esophagus or within the stomach or you know before passing to other um other Chambers and so I hear you saying that critical processing is happening at each of these Chambers the sphincters are determining how long that processing occurs and that distinct sets of neurop pod cells are likely detecting distinct of qualities and quantities within the food chemical qualities and quantities within the food and relaying that to the brain that's correct and here's something that since we're getting into the future of uh of this"}

Great. Sometimes those people are very lean, oftentimes they're not, and they're getting a lot of cold exposure. And one of the things that happens is, if you expose yourself to cold over and over, you adapt, you become cold adapted. And when you do that, you no longer get the epinephrine, the adrenaline release from the cold and therefore you don't get the succinate release and the shivering and the brown fat thermogenic effect quite as intensely. So if you want to use cold for other reasons, and certainly cold water swims can be fun. And there's, you know, long as you can do them safely, they're great. I've gotten into cold water swimming for some period of time. You can use cold for resilience, et cetera. But if you want to use cold to increase fat loss, then getting this shiver process going the cooling and rewarming which accelerates the amount of, or increases the amount of shiver. That's going to be the way to go. One note about cold and some of the factors that it releases. A few years back there was a lot of excitement about this hormone called irisin, I-R-I-S-I-N, which was associated with cold. And there was a lot of excitement about its potential role in increasing metabolism so much so that people were starting to explore this as a potential fat loss drug. To my knowledge that went nowhere. The science eventually shifted over to succinate as the main factor in cold induced thermogenesis through this brown fat pathway. But if anyone out there is aware of any positive effects of iricin or of any signs of irisin that I'm overlooking here, or that I'm speaking about incorrectly, please let me know. I'd be very curious to learn. Now, I want to just talk about brown fat a little bit more,"}

strategies are trying to think about how to structure your day or how much to study or when to study let's get the most important things out of the way first neuroplasticity and learning that is convert converting your studying efforts into retention of knowledge is a two-step process you probably heard about active engagement that's just a fancy set of words for focus for really attending to the information that you're trying to learn and it is very important anytime you're trying to learn new information so focus goes with alertness you can't be focused if you're not alert this is prerequisite so you need to be alert and you need to be focused in order to pay attention to the information that you're trying to learn in fact it is the process of being focused and attending that cues your nervous system that something is important that something's different about whatever sensory experience you happen to be having when you're focused and attending whether or not it's the information you're hearing or that you're looking at or both that cue at the level of neurochemicals in your brain and body signals to the neurons hey you're going to have to change you're going to have to alter your connections either make them stronger or weaker or a combination of those things in order to make sure that your nervous system can retain and use the information at a future time so that's step one and of course as a part of step one most people when they hear about optimal studying strategies they want to know you know what should they do what should they take in order to learn better well here's what everyone should take in order to learn better which is a great night's sleep the night before limiting your external stress although some stresses good because it cues up your alertness it actually allows you to remember certain things better we'll talk about this a little bit later no one can remove all stress from their life but we know one thing for sure your ability to be alert and focused is going to be greater if you slept well the night before okay so sleep is without question the best neut Tropic right the word neut Tropic means smart drug I don't really like that term because learning involves all sorts of things it's not just about being smart it's about being able to attend it's about sometimes being creative flexible with ideas and information here's the point you're going to need to get your sleep right in order to be able to study and learn at your absolute best and I've done many episodes of The hman Lab podcast about sleep we have a newsletter about sleep that details in a short PDF format the various things you can do to get your sleep optimized so to speak you can find all that hubman lab.com by putting sleep into the search function we don't have time to discuss that material now but get your sleep right so that you can be alert and focused when it comes time to learn now the process of being alert and focused on particular material that you want to learn can be enhanced by just having a silent script within your head silent meaning you're not saying it out loud where when you sit down to learn you're looking at a book or you're listening to a lecture perhaps a podcast like this you're thinking okay I need to learn this I need to learn this you can voluntarily ramp up your level of focus and alertness by telling yourself that information is important don't be a passive participant in learning this is the basis of active learning by expecting the information to be so interesting that it pulls your level of attention and focus out of you rather learn to engage your attention and focus voluntarily volitionally okay when we hear about ADHD attention deficit hyperactivity disorder we know that people with ADHD can attend very rapidly they can really pay close attention for long periods of time if they like a given topic or a given experience or activity they have serious challenges however engaging their attention and alertness if they are not excited about an activity or information and so it is the Hallmark of all good Learners to be able to voluntarily force yourself to attend and to focus and when I say force yourself that means a constant bringing back of your mind's attention to whatever it is you're trying to learn it is meant to feel difficult I say meant to feel difficult because that strain that you feel that encouraging or in some cases forcing yourself to attend sometimes even putting on a hoodie and hat you know literally putting blinders so that you can only attend to the material right in front of you that straining that you feel reflects in part the release of neuromodulators like epinephrine adrenaline in the brain and body which serve to cue the neural circuits that they need to change at a later time okay so the strength that you feel in trying to learn the strain that you feel in forcing yourself to learn how to focus that is good that's a c-tier nervous system that it's going to need to change that neuroplasticity needs to take place think about it if you didn't feel that strain and you were able to perform whatever it is that you were doing or remember whatever information it is that you're being exposed to seamlessly well then your nervous system wouldn't have to change because it already has the capabilities within the neural circuits so that strain that you feel that agitation is great that's a cue that you are learning or that you set the learning process in motion now it's also the case that some people don't have great levels of focus and attention and there are of course"}
{"question": "Does exposure to UVB light, particularly through the eyes, play a significant role in enhancing immune function and reducing the incidence of illnesses like colds and flus?", "doc_id": "UF0nqolsNZc_16", "video_id": "UF0nqolsNZc", "video_title": "Using Light (Sunlight, Blue Light & Red Light) to Optimize Health | Huberman Lab Podcast #68", "video_header": "Light & Enhanced Immune Function", "segment_idx": "16", "time_start": "1:19:47", "time_end": "1:23:25", "context": "of UVB light, in particular on immune function. All the organs of our body are inside our skin. And so information about external conditions, meaning the environment that we're in, need to be communicated to the various organs of our body. Some of them have more direct access to what's going on outside. So for instance, the cells in your brain that reside right over the roof of your mouth, your hypothalamus, they control hormone output, and they control the biological functions that we call circadian functions, the ones that change every 24 hours. Well, those are just one or two connections, meaning synapses away from those cells in your eye that perceive UB, UVB light, excuse me. Other organs of your body, such as your spleen, which is involved in the creation of molecules and cells that combat infection, well, those are a long ways away from those cell in your eye. And in fact, they're a long ways away from your skin. There are beautiful studies showing that if we get more UVB exposure from sunlight or from appropriate artificial sources, that spleen and immune function are enhanced, and there's a very logical, well-established circuit as to how that happens. Your brain actually connects to your spleen. Now, it's not the case that you can simply think, \"Okay, spleen, turn on, release killer cells, go out and combat infection.\" However, UVB light arriving on the eyes is known to trigger activation of the neurons within the so-called sympathetic nervous system. These neurons are part of the larger thing that we call the autonomic nervous system, meaning it's below or not accessible by conscious control. It's the thing that controls your heartbeat, controls your breathing and that also activates or flips on the switch of your immune system. When we get a lot of UVB light in our eyes, or I should say sufficient UVB light in our eyes, a particular channel, a particular set of connections within the sympathetic nervous system is activated, and our spleen deploys immune cells and molecules that scavenge for and combat infection. So if you've noticed that you get fewer colds and flus and other forms of illness in the summer months, part of that could be because of the increase in temperature in your environment, because typically longer days are associated with more warmth in your environment as opposed to winter days, which are short when it tends to be colder out. Well, that's true, but it's also the case that people around you have fewer colds and flus and that you will get infected with fewer colds and flus and other infections, because if those infections, whether or not they're bacterial or viral, arrive in your body, right, if you inhale them or they get into your mouth or on your skin, your spleen meets those infections with a greater output. In other words, the soldiers of your immune system, the chemicals and cell types of your immune system that combat infection are in a more ready, deployed stance, if you will. If you want to know more about the immune system and immune function, I did an entire episode about the immune system and the brain, you can find that at hubermanlab.com. We talk about cytokines, we talk about killer cells, B cells, T cells, et cetera, a lot of detail there. So we often think about the summer months and the spring months as fewer infections floating around. But in fact, there aren't fewer infections floating around. We are simply better at combating those infections, and therefore there's less infection floating around. So we are still confronted with a lot of infections. We're just able to combat them better. What does this mean in terms of a tool?"}
{"question": "What is the OVLT, and how does it play a role in the body's fever response to toxins and bad substances in the bloodstream?", "doc_id": "rW9QKc-iFoY_24", "video_id": "rW9QKc-iFoY", "video_title": "How to Optimize Your Brain-Body Function & Health", "video_header": "Fever: Triggers and Control Knobs: OVLT", "segment_idx": "24", "time_start": "1:30:40", "time_end": "1:36:59", "context": "Now let's talk about fever. In previous episodes, and in future episodes, we deal with thermal regulation, which is the body's ability to regulate its temperature. Talk about cold and heat and saunas and ice baths and physical performance. We're not going to deal with all that right now, but I promise we will going forward. Today, I only want to talk about fever because fever directly relates to interoception. What do I mean by that? Well, a fever is simply an increase in body temperature, that increase in body temperature is triggered by neurons in the brain. And those neurons in the brain are triggered by the presence of particular things in the bloodstream. What sorts of things? Well, toxins, bacteria, viruses, when something bad gets in our system, the body doesn't know it's bad, it just knows it's foreign, and it hasn't seen it before. Or that it's in the wrong compartment of the body. So earlier we were talking about proteins that leak out of the gut and get elsewhere, you know, you don't want a piece of steak sitting in your bicep. That would be bad, you would actually develop antibodies, you would have a horrible infection. But your body has this intelligence, and that intelligence is to know, Hmm, these proteins are normally not seen in this region and then your body or the cells there, I should say, we'll release something that then will travel to the brain and will trigger an increase in body temperature so that your body cooks the bad thing or the cause of the bad thing. It's really a beautiful adaptive mechanism. We always think fever is so terrible, but fever is there to cook the bad thing that's inside you, or that has left the correct compartment inside you and is in the wrong compartment inside you. So what's beautiful about the fever mechanism is that it looks a lot like the barfing mechanism. Basically you have a set of neurons that sit near the ventricles, remember the ventrals is hole in the tube, that is you, the tube that is, you are a tube, a series of tubes. And your brain has a hole down the middle. And it extends down to the bottom of your spinal cord, at the front, it's called the ventricles, they start with what are called the lateral ventricles and the excuse me, starts with the third and the lateral ventricles, and then it goes to the fourth ventricle and then to what's called the central canal. But basically is just a big space in the middle of your nervous system in the middle of your brain. And you have one ventricle that I already mentioned called the third ventricle. And it's shaped kind of like a thin oval up upright, if you're listening to this, just think an I, the shape of an I, but it's kind of rotated 90 degrees. So it's up and down as opposed to across. And along that third ventricle, there's there a little neurons that can sense what's in the cerebral spinal fluid that fills the ventricle. So in other words, you have neurons that are sensing the chemistry of your cerebral spinal fluid, and that have access therefore to the chemistry of your body. Because that cerebral spinal fluid is going up and down the brain and spinal cord. But into that cerebral spinal fluid are signals about the various chemicals within the body. So this is not a mechanical system. This is a chemical system. Remember we're talking about mechanical information and chemical information accessing the brain. So if you have something bad in your system, you've ingested a, you breathe in a virus or you inhaled some bacteria, or you got a cut on your leg and some bacteria are growing there. Of course, locally, there will be effects, little things called the mast cell. This M-A-S-T little packets of histamine literally will go there and explode and cause inflammation, which is actually a good inflammation. And we'll release little things called macrophages to gobble up the infection. The other day, it was in Texas, it was some mean little mosquitoes in Texas, and a lot of them, and I would stand outside and I'd get bitten, I didn't feel a thing, but then later that night, they started swelling up and itching and then I'd itch them, and then they'd swell even more. That was because of the release of mass cells, of histamines inside those mass cells that would literally causing inflammation of the tissue. It wasn't the poison from the mosquito itself. It was the immune response to those. Well, you also have this systemic or body-wide attempt to kill stuff, and that's the fever. So the neurons that these ventricles with cerebral spinal fluid go by a particular name, they're called circumventricular organs, meaning near circum, ventricular near the ventricles. And you have these organs and there are a set of neurons, has a really cool name called the OVLT. I don't know why I like that, but I just like it, it's the organum vasculosum of the lateral terminalis organum vasculosum of the lateral terminalis, OVLT are the neurons that respond to toxins and bad stuff in your bloodstream, however minor or major. And they release things like ILK-1, which are inflammatory cytokines inflammatory in this case is good, you want inflammation at the site of an infection. It's a good thing. It's going to help with healing. And it's going to change the conditions in your body, what's going to happen is when those OVLT neurons are activated, because you have something bad in your body or something bad is happening in your body, they communicate with an area of the brain called the preoptic area of your hypothalamus and the preoptic area cranks up your temperature and tries to cook that bad thing. Now it's worth talking about fever for a moment and talking about thermal regulation, because I think this actually could save some lives. So if you are overheated to a point where, you know, you're getting up past 102 or 103, it's going to vary depending on person to person and certainly age, you know, kids, some people think can tolerate higher levels of fever than adults, but look, you always want to be cautious about heating up the brain too much, because once those neurons are gone, they do not come back and neurons do not do well in very high temperatures. Once your body temperature starts getting up to 102, 103, certainly 104, you are starting to enter serious danger zone. This can happen through exercise in hot environments or an inability to escape heat because you don't have covering or adequate ventilation or cooling. It can also be because of excessive fever, for whatever reason. A lot of people think the way to deal with this is to put a cool compress on the back of the neck or to cool the torso."}

{"question": "What are the two unique characteristics of CBT/Exposure Therapy that are specifically tailored for treating OCD, and how do they contribute to the overall treatment of OCD?", "doc_id": "OadokY8fcAA_11", "video_id": "OadokY8fcAA", "video_title": "The Science & Treatment of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) | Huberman Lab Podcast #78", "video_header": "Unique Characteristics of CBT/Exposure Therapy in OCD Treatment", "segment_idx": "11", "time_start": "1:02:00", "time_end": "1:10:15", "context": "in the context of OCD that you often don't see in the use of CBT, that is cognitive behavioral therapy, for other types of psychiatric challenges and disorders. The first element is one of stair casing. And I already mentioned this before, but this gradual and progressive increase in the anxiety that you're trying to evoke from the patient, from the person suffering from OCD. That's done in the context of the office or the laboratory, again, by a trained and licensed clinician. But then the person leaves, right? They leave the office, they leave the laboratory. And a very vital component of CBT and exposure therapy for people with OCD is that they have and perform what's called homework, is literally what they call. This might be seen in other sorts of treatments but for OCD, homework is extremely important, because within the context of a laboratory experiment or the clinic, patients often feel so much support that they can tolerate those heightened levels of anxiety and interrupt their compulsions. Whereas when they get home, oftentimes the familiarity of the environment brings 'em to a place where all of a sudden those obsessions and compulsions start interacting the same way and they have a very hard time suppressing the behaviors. Why would that be? Well in neuroscience, we have a phrase, it's called conditioned place preference and conditioned place avoidance. There's some other phrases too but basically it all has to do with a simple thing which is, when you feel something repeatedly in a given environment, or sometimes even once within a given environment, you tend to feel that same thing again when you return to that or similar environments. Okay, So conditioned place blank, or conditioned place that is simply fancy nerd speak for the fact that when you're in a place and something good happens, you tend to feel good if you return to that place or a place like it, or if something bad happens in a given place, you tend to feel bad when you return to that place or a place like it. I think that most salient example that leaps to mind is in, unfortunately, the category of bad, but I had some friends years ago visit San Francisco. There's been a ongoing, it seems like it's been happening forever, but this is really in the last decade of daytime break-ins and nighttime break-ins into cars to steal anything from computers to what seems to be like a box of tissues. And there are numerous reasons for this, I don't want to get into, it's not the topic of today's podcast, but I will use this as an opportunity to say if you're visiting anywhere in the Bay Area, do not leave anything in your car because the window will get broken into, sometimes in broad daylight. Some good friends of mine were visiting the Bay Area and I texted them and said, hey, by the way, when you're headed to dinner, guys, make sure you bring in all your luggage and computers however inconvenient that might be. They wrote back, too late, everything got stolen. So some years ago now, I think five, six years ago this happened, sadly, everything got stolen. Most of it could be replaced, but some of it was very sentimental to them. Every time we talk, every time we consider having a meeting in a particular city, this comes up as I don't want to be there, I don't like that city anymore, et cetera. And of course, San Francisco has some wonderful redeeming features, but it only takes one bad incident in one location to kind of color the whole picture dark, so to speak. The brain works that way. The brain generalizes, it's not a very specific organ, again, it's a prediction machine in addition to other things. So in the case of CBT therapy, the reason there's homework is that when people go home, oftentimes that's when they relapse, if you want to call it that, back into their obsessions and compulsions. And that location, that conditioned place is where it becomes most important to challenge the anxiety and to deal with the anxiety, to not try and suppress the anxiety through compulsions or other means. And when I say other means, I want to highlight something, it will come up again a little bit later in the podcast, that substance abuse is very common in people with OCD because of the anxiety component and also because of people's feelings that they just can't escape from the thoughts or behavioral patterns that are so characteristic of OCD. So alcohol abuse or cannabis abuse, or other forms of narcotics abuse are very common in OCD. Later, we'll talk about whether or not cannabis can or cannot help with OCD. But needless to say, suppressing anxiety is exactly the wrong direction that one should take if the goal is to ultimately relieve or eliminate the OCD. So we now have two characteristics of CBT exposure therapy that are extremely important for OCD and somewhat unique to the treatment of OCD and that's the staircasing up towards the really bad fear, the really severe and specific articulation and understanding and feeling of how bad things really would be if someone engaged in a particular behavior or avoided a particular behavior. Then there's the component of homework given by the clinician for the person to be able to create a broader set of context in which they can deal with the anxiety, not engage in the compulsions. And then a very unique feature of treatment of OCD that you don't see in many other psychiatric disorders are home visits. And I find this fascinating. I think that the field of psychiatry and psychology traditionally doesn't allow for or invite home visits, but this component of context, location and context being so vital to the treatment and relief of OCD has inspired many psychiatrists and psychologists to get permission to do home visits where they actually go visit their patients in their native setting, in their home cages, right? They're not mice, but in their home-home cages, I'm being facetious here, but people, mice live in cages, at least in the laboratory, and humans generally live in houses or elsewhere, so they visit them in their home in order to see how they're interacting and the particular locations that evoke the most anxiety and the least anxiety. Some of the, I don't want to call them crutches, but some of the tools that people are using to confront and deal with the obsessions and compulsions and in particular to try and identify some of the tools and tricks that people are using to try and avoid that heightened anxiety, because, once again, and I know I'm repeating myself, but I think this is just so vital and so unique about OCD and the treatment of OCD, the critical need for the patient to be able to tolerate extremely elevated levels of anxiety is so crucial. So if people are avoiding certain rooms in the house, or if people are avoiding certain foods or certain locations in the kitchen, the clinician can start to identify that by mere observation. And I should mention here that patients are not always aware of how they're interacting with their home environment. Some of these patterns are so deeply ingrained in people that they don't even realize that they're constantly turning to the left, or they don't even realize that they're only washing their hands on one side of the sink. And so the clinician, by visiting the home, can start to interrogate a bit in a polite way, in a friendly, in a supportive way as to, do you ever think about why you always flip the faucet to the left or flip the faucet to the right, et cetera. Now, we all do a lot of things that are habitual. We all do things that are somewhat regular from day to day. In fact, I would invite you to ask yourself, do you always put your toothbrush in the same location? Do you always cap the toothbrush before or after you use it? What sorts of things do you- You wipe the little threading on the toothpaste or not? I'm somebody, I confess that I have, well, I have about 3,500 pet peeves, but one of my pet peeves is toothpaste kind of on the thread of the toothpaste. It really bothers me, I don't know why, almost as much as trying to wipe it off bothers me, which creates a certain challenge. And if I talk about this any further, then I think I would qualify for obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. But I have to say, I don't experience a ton of anxiety about it. It doesn't govern my life. In fact, I realize that right now there are tubes of toothpaste that have toothpaste along the thread everywhere in the world and it doesn't really bother me. I can still sit here and provide some information about OCD to you. It's not intrusive, at least not to my awareness. So by the home visit, the therapist can really start to explore through direct questioning and can allow the patient to explore through direct questioning of themselves the things that they might be conscious of and the things that they might not be conscious of that would qualify for OCD. So I'd like to just briefly summarize the key elements of cognitive behavioral therapy and exposure therapy"}

Generations as well like for the that empty frame the now empty frame um and then moving from dystopia to protopia that that all sounds great but I think a lot of people might think okay well at best I could do that for myself and the people that um that I know it's going to be hard to do that as as a greater good for the greater good and you could say well that does contribute to the greater good this is actually very similar to what we tell um graduate students when they're uh they get their first round of data you go okay well the data often times not always but often times you you say well the data are cool like if it continues this way that' be an interesting story and they get the sense and you already have the sense because you have the experience to know like the best case scenario is is a nice solid paper MH that your three reviewers and maybe 20 other people will read and you're going to spend the next five years of your life on this thing maybe three but probably five years of your life and you'll get your PhD and there's always this question like do you ditch that project and go for something else or do you stay with that project in other words what you're saying is you get to put your brick on the wall but it's a brick whereas you know there are other projects you go whoa like that's you know that's like One Wing of the cathedral and and it's a rare instance where that happens and a lot of it's luck and it's doesn't always work out anyway but you know what we're saying here is you know how hard people are willing to work is often related to what they feel the potential payoff will be if they can sense the payoff and by the way I love the protocols that you offered the empty frame the journaling to future self this notion of time capsuling your your present thinking into the future um the Aging of self these are these are very actionable things I plan to do them um and I think they're very valuable but if I understand correctly you are interested in creating a movement of sorts um where many if not everybody is thinking this this way because the other model is okay well the Elon will take care of it for us and I'm um or the uh you know the or the system's so broken and like there's nothing I can do I'm just trying to make ends meet so how does one create a like a like a reward system or a social media platform or you know how does one you know join up with other people who are trying to do this so the question you're getting at is in in a lot of the work that I've read and listened to on this podcast often times it's about how do we you know obviously how do we how do we optimize the self and I mean that in a good way not in a selfish way um how do we make ourselves better right that's where you have to start I'm advocating for for how do we optimize Society how do we optimize civilization and this is a clear case where unlike when think of scale being you know make more widgets at a cheaper price this is really a one plus one plus one plus one at Infinity so if at infinum if we think about just for example how many listeners and viewers there are of this podcast Millions right um and how many people they interact with within their within their closest sphere and you go out right so right now that your listeners have the potential to live and act long paath and in this way where they're doing something for a greater they're thinking about their purpose in the world as nested within the larger purpose of our species to to allow for more mass flourishing in the future uh for generations to come if you think about your listeners and how they interact and how they Model Behavior your potenti and in their spheres you're at 30 40 50 million people right that's a very very large number um and what we know about social emotional contagion is that these things are contagious they are memes this is Susan Blackmore's work um that's how it scales it actually is one of those things where you're not going to you know just add powder um and it all of a sudden will will create this this optimal future for everyone because only one person that does it like we all have a role to play in it it's like literally what what I would want is anyone who's listening or watching this uh when they're done it um take a few minutes and think about what what kind of Futures do I want for myself for my family for the generations to come and what is my role in that great play what do I have to do and yes you need the protocols to kind of bring you back into there right for me it's easy because I wrote the book I did the show I can just think long path I can do it for others this is going to be the first time they're thinking about this or maybe they've been thinking about it for years even in their smallest interactions they start doing it and we you know this is this gets into kind of the Santa Fe Institute and complexity Theory this stuff starts to actually reverberate that's how we do it you know there's not we don't need to March for long-termism right we don't we don't we don't need bumper stickers thank you there will be no bumper stickers there bumper stickers there will be no bumper stickers it's about placing our very essence and our actions within the realm of possibility for the Futures that we want and our role in that and then the purpose I don't care if you're a barista if you're a surfing instructor if you're a you know brilliant podcaster um whatever it is that you do do it with the intention and recognition that you're modeling a way of being in the world that has ramifications and reverberations Beyond this current moment I you said earlier well you know who knows if anyone will listen to your podcast what I can tell you with certainty because I'm sure it's probably already happened is a large language model an llm some you know what we call AI right now is already or it will at some point ingest the hubman Lab podcast yeah we have one we have a hubman lab AI there you go we haven't advertise it very heavily but it's there you can ask me questions it's pretty good it sounds a bit like me the jokes are dry they're dry and not funny I say mostly funny but you'll get I'll give you some more um but eventually that will pull that will percolate out so at the speed of things are going three or four years from now this very conversation how we're model what what I learned in school discourse ethics how we talk to one another that is teaching these machines how to think and act and who and what we are and how to become the best of or the worst of ourselves what we put out there the kind of the public facing content is going to become what these machines think of as how they should be and we're modeling it for for for them um and going back to the higher education example for a second I think higher education like many institutions as as AI what we call that fully comes online is going to radically radically change and it will be you know a Cambridge or an Oxford tutor in everyone's ear and higher education this idea that you kind of come together um to receive information will start to dissipate from higher education but what higher education will start to do and I think what I need to focus on is not just the intellectual and and and the cognitive but also the psychological and the emotional uh core of who you are and helping you develop that well aen to that uh you know there was a former guest on this podcast uh or there was a guest on this podcast previously uh Dr Wendy Suzuki's professor at NYU I think now she's the dean of of um Arts and Sciences I think is the correct title and you know she's trying to bring some of her Laboratories data on the value of even very brief meditations to Stress Management in college first to kind of to help students manage the stress that is college and being in your early 20s um but I think there's a larger theme there which is to try and teach emotional development to teach self-regulation um because many people don't get that I mean you know that or they get it but then there are big gaps um and I I love the way that you're describing this basically it's it's a

polypodium so this is a pill it's a supplement basically that one can take I only call it a supplement because um it's not a prescription drug correct yeah um that protects your skin from UV damage from the inside yeah so exactly right mineral based creams and lotions I tend to prefer and recommend in my practice and most people will if you're worried about any risk any consequence chemicals I tend to personally avoid now this may not be in line with all my Dermatology colleagues but I tend to avoid them and I don't not recommend them for kids in terms of things that you can do in addition to provide sun protection polypodium is a fern from the Amazon rainforest that was discovered when they studied an indigenous population that would eat this Fern before they would go on their fishing Expeditions on the Amazon and they'd be gone for 3 Days they'd eat this Fern and come back not burned so a lot of studies were done on this Fern in the last 5 10 years that showed it increases your Skin's minimal athema dose the amount of redness your skin gets from UV exposure that's our general barometer for Effectiveness without any topicals it's taken or ingested orally I personally use a form called Sun powder that also has nicotinamide in it we can talk about nicotinamide later but if in and of itself it works great in conjunction with topicals you get the best of both worlds you get internal shielding and external shielding now it is a supplement so it's not a controlled drug the way the FDA regulates sunscreen so it isn't really a sunscreen but it's a way to prevent sunburns increase the amount of time you can be outside and increase the efficacy of your topical so if you're somebody who is very fair skinned who burns all the time or if you're somebody who has like what we call Sun hives or or PE um prickly sun rash pmle um this is an added thing that you can use that will boost your sun protective factors it's awesome and if you're somebody who's active like you're in the water or you're you know exercising or you're playing a sport you can't reapply I I love polypodium for that added benefit what are the dosages of polypodium that are useful and are there any side effects great question so there's been a wide variety of doses um investigated anywhere from 500 240 480 generally you said 1500 no uh sorry 50 milligrams 100 milligram 240 480 uh um somewhere in the between 50 and 400 80 milligrams is what's commonly used the most common side effect can be a little um upside stomach if you can't to at the plant forever it's taken you can either take it daily as a method of preventing premature photoaging and pigmentary change or you can take it as an as needed an hour before you get sun um to Shield you from the Sun um the other thing that it helps prevent um that some sunscreens cannot particularly the chemical sunscreens cannot is the effects of visible light so there are certain skin conditions the most common is melasma which a lot of women have you know it's I think the bane of their existence it used to be called The Mask of pregnancy and melasma is something that is very sensitive to both UV and visible light chemical sunscreens don't do a good job blocking visible light polypodium has been shown to help block the effects of visible light as well which makes melasma worse it's this discoloration that we see mostly in women usually after pregnancy or women who are on birth control is really challenging to treat and sun protection is the first line like diligent sun protection but we found that supplementing with polypodium enhances this and makes patients treatments more effective interesting and you mentioned Sun powder as a potential that's a brand name so yes Sun powder is a brand it's um a product that I helped formulate with one of my colleagues um over at Harvard who's a a laser and aesthetic dermatologist Harvard trained and this is something that we came up with when I was up at Stanford and it's a it's a supplement dedicated to skin health and it does two things I take it daily myself as a single scoop it helps reduce your skin cancer risk your non-melanoma skin cancer risk by up to 30% and the data was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in a phase three randomized trial for one of the ingredients the other ingredient obviously is NI is polypodium and I take that one to prevent you know Sun rated Chang ches but also help reduce my risk of burning often when I personally find the need for sunscreen it's when I can't apply always at the water I'm swimming you know my my son he's seven he races on a swim team I cannot get this kid to reapply sunscreen so this is a supplement that I I give him and we it took us several years of formulation and testing including me testing which is minimal athema dose testing to come up with it's easy over the- counter and it's one of many supplements that contain polypodium I just like it because it's a single scoop and I mix it into my morning drink and I'm done"}

{"question": "Can you explain how the water content of food affects our sense of fullness and whether drinking water before eating can help us eat less?", "doc_id": "C5KpIXjpzdY_20", "video_id": "C5KpIXjpzdY", "video_title": "Dr. Zachary Knight: The Science of Hunger & Medications to Combat Obesity", "video_header": "Dopamine & Learning, Water Content & Food", "segment_idx": "20", "time_start": "1:46:03", "time_end": "1:53:22", "context": "other element that that that is important but very much less studied but I find much more interesting which is how you connect this this the sensory cues associated with food its taste its flavor um its smell uh with the consequences for the body and this is so important because um so much of whether we like or dislike a particular food or drink is related to its post-ingestive effects you come to like things for example that have calories so this is one of the reasons that adults will eat vegetables and other Savory Foods that children find disgusting even though they're a little bit bitter you learn through experience this makes me feel good to eat this and even maybe at a completely subconscious level there's also a level of learning that occurs um and this of course happens with other things like coffee and beer and other things like that and so there's been an idea that this this other much slower learning occurs and the reason I say it's slower is because because the time between when you taste the food and when it actually gets into your intestine and releases the the hormones that might drive this is quite slow separated by tens of minutes um but how that works hasn't been clear there's been an idea that dopamine might be involved um but it hadn't really received a lot of attention and so we set out to investigate what is the role of dopamine in these post-ingestive responses and sort of map out for the dopamine system how does the dopamine system respond not when you see the golden arches which is usually the kinds of experiments that have been performed but rather when you deliver nutrients directly to your stomach or when you deliver water directly to your stomach if you're thirsty and so on and what we saw was that there are these different populations of dopamine neurons that are tuned to respond to signals from inside the body and so there are some that respond when nutrients are in the stomach and intestine um there are others that respond when in a thirsty Mouse when the blood is rehydrated when you basically satiate your thirst and we showed that the um the purpose or at least at least a purpose of that activation is to cause you to learn about the effects of what you just ate basically to create this connection between the flavor of something and its post-ingestive effects so that sort of that that delayed dopamine signal uh after ingested food and fluids is sort of reinforcing this connection between the flavor of what I just ate and that it was something good for me one of the sort of interesting things about that paper that was not the direction we initially expected to go in is that um for food I think it's kind of intuitive there are lots of flavors to food you have to learn you know what all these different flavors mean for thirst people find it a little less obvious because thirst is just water aren't you just born knowing what water is like how do you have to learn anything to do with drinking a glass of water but it actually is a learning a learning question in part because for many animals probably most animals thirst is something that's associated with eating not drinking there's this study I love um of rabbits in New Zealand so so you there's not a lot of people studying what animals how they get their fluids in the wild cuz who cares but it's kind of interesting and so in New Zealand uh uh this huge rabbit problem because they're invasive P species that that that was introduced in 1800s and they're just eating all the all the land and so there's lots of money to study rabbits just understand their ecology and so um group of researchers did this experiment where they made this big pen outside where they put a bunch of rabbits in the rabbits couldn't escape but they had all their natural food it was like an outdoor area and they also put a trough of water so the rabits always had access to water just like clean water then they could measure how much water the rabbits drank and what they basically found is that nine months out of a year rabbits drink Zero Water they drink absolutely zero because they get all of their water from food the only time they drink is during the winter when all of the greenery has sort of become shriveled and then they can't get water from that anymore and so it's just kind of interesting aspect of of how many animals are very different from the way we think about ingestive Behavior but but that fact that animals have to get water from food raises this question how do they know which foods are rehydrating that's presumably they have to learn that because you can't just look at a food and say if you've never had any experience oh yeah this is something that's very water rich and this will rehydrate me when I'm thirsty and this one is not and so James the graduate student who led this project uh basically investigated this by uh giving mice different fluids and then measuring how the dopamine response and he showed there was this delayed dopamine response after the mice had drank the fluids uh uh that correlated with rehydration of the blood so a whole bunch of dopam neurons get strongly activated when the blood is rehydrated and he hypothesized this might be a signal this delayed this delayed activation of dopam neurons that allows animals in the wild to learn uh uh uh that food I just ate is is is rehydrating and so he did an experiment where he basically gave them two different flavors mimicking sort of the flavors of two different foods one of which was hydrating and one of which was not and the Animals couldn't tell because he infused the water directly into their stomach and uh he showed that basically uh uh these dopamine neurons are critical for them learning that Association so so that's the story of that I love it and I'll tell you why um when I was in college for reasons that I don't recall I decided to run an experiment on myself where I would eat one meal that was fairly low water content like a piece of meat or something with some cheese you know what some people call a keto meal but I wasn't ketogenic I don't even think I knew what a ketogenic diet was at that point and then the next meal I would have like a salad and some fruits and then I would back and forth and I generally would only eat two or three times a day you know anyway there's only so many hours in the day um and I found it to be incredibly satiating um and I found that I felt great and I can imagine any number of different reasons for that and there are these theories that you probably recall that the the diet that was being um promoted in the 90s where people would either eat carbohydrates or proteins separately like there was some wackiness out there and as I say that I'm sure I'll get assaulted in the comments probably not wacky I'm sure there's some enzymatic basis for why that would be useful if you enjoy it go for it um you know um I I don't have a feeling about it one way or the other but one thing I noticed was that um low water content containing meals um either by virtue of the foods that they include or by virtue of the fact that they're not diluted so to speak um it's a different taste experience to eat those Foods than it is to eat like a big salad or something of that sort um in any event I don't do that any longer I just sort of stopped but it was a fun experiment um and I think it was efficient because at the time I had very low money as a student so you know generally fruits and vegetables were less costly than meats and things of that sort but um in all seriousness um to what extent do you think humans uh overeat or undereat depending on the water content of the food it's an interesting question so you know there is this advice that you should um if you're hungry first drink something drink some water and see if you're still hungry and the idea is that um perhaps uh uh humans can't always I mean we our our interceptive sense our ability to sense what our body needs is not perfect and sometimes we could be confused and we could really be thirsty when we're hungry and hungry when we're thirsty and there's some evidence that that could help um I would say it's probably not a huge effect in most of modern day life but but uh it's an interesting idea mhm yeah um this brings us to the topic of thirst something that your laboratory has worked on extensively and the topic"}
{"question": "Can feeling bored and anxious actually be a catalyst for creativity, or are these emotions inherently at odds with the creative process?", "doc_id": "p3JLaF_4Tz8_8", "video_id": "p3JLaF_4Tz8", "video_title": "Dr. Anna Lembke: Understanding & Treating Addiction", "video_header": "Boredom & Anxiety Lead to Creativity", "segment_idx": "8", "time_start": "35:45", "time_end": "40:28", "context": "because I do think that people who have been addicted and then get into recovery, do have a hard won wisdom that we can all benefit from. And the wisdom, I guess, you know, to distill it down, I mean it's many things. But in terms of, you know, dopamine, the wisdom is there are adaptive ways to get your dopamine. And there are less than adaptive ways. And in general, you could describe the adaptive ways as not too potent. So not tipping that balance too hard or too fast to the side of pleasure. - So does that mean never allowing myself to be absolutely in complete bliss? Or does it mean not allowing myself to stay in that state too long? - The latter. I think the latter. Then that gets to temperament, so I'm going to get that to a second. So, in general, what we want is some kind of flexibility in that balance, and the ability to easily reassert homeostasis. We don't want to break our balance, which is possible if we overindulge for enough period of time and end up with a balance tipped to the side of pain, this dopamine deficit state we've been talking about. We want a flexible, resilient balance, right, which can be sensitive to things going on in the environment, which can experience pleasure and approach, which can experience pain and recoil, right? This is all adaptive and healthy and necessary and good. We would never want a balance that doesn't tilt. - Right. - That would be a disaster, we wouldn't be human. And we wouldn't want that, it'd be really, really boring. On the other hand, what people in recovery from addiction talk about is, to some extent having to learn to live with things being a little boring a lot of the time, right? So trying to avoid some of this intensity and thrill-seeking and escapism, that really is at the core of addictive tendencies. - Sorry to interrupt, but when you say boring, can we add stressful and boring? - Yes. - Because there are days where I'm not, I'm one of these people that have to remind myself to have fun, - Yes. - because I sort of forgot what the term means, because I like to think that I experience a lot of pleasure in little things, but I'm a pretty hard-driving guy. I like goals and big milestones and all that stuff. Anyway. The point being that many days I'm not bored thinking oh, there's nothing to do, but I am kind of overwhelmed by the number of things that are really not pleasureful that I have to do. - Yeah, right. - I won't mention what they are, 'cause I don't my colleagues to be like that's why you don't respond to emails. No, just your email. Not yours Anna, but theirs. In any event, so anxiety and boredom can hang out together, right? Am I correct in? - Oh, for sure. I mean, actually boredom is highly anxiety-provoking. - Okay. That's good to know, 'cause I think people hear boredom and they think like, oh, there's nothing to do here. - Right. - There's nothing. I feel like we have a ton to do, we just don't really want to do it. - Right, right. - As opposed to something that we're excited to do. - Right, okay, so this gets to sort of some of the core things. Also we were talking about earlier about finding your passion. So I'm going to try to link it all together. But basically boredom, first of all boredom is a rare experience for modern humans, because we're constantly distracting ourselves from the present moment, and we have an infinite number of ways to do that, right. But boredom is really, I think, an important and necessary experience. But it is scary because when you allow yourself to be bored, let's say you were, had that list of all the things you hate to do, but you actually got them all done. Imagine that. And you got your forthcoming book done, and you did all your interviews. - It could happen! Lightning could strike. - Right. And you walked your dog, and you cleaned your house, and you went shopping. Imagine that for a moment. You would be sitting in your house, and my guess is you would be terrified because, wow, what am I supposed to do now, right? There's nothing I really have to do. And that is really, really scary. That can feel like free fall. And yet that's really an important and good experience to have. And I think that is an experience out of which we can have a lot of creative initiative, but also really consider our priorities and values. Okay, here I am on planet Earth. What the he-haw am I going to do with my life? What do I really care about? How do I really want to spend my time, when I'm not distracting myself, you know, in order to spend it. And, you know, then this gets back to our conversation"}

night's sleep and and and we all know we all notice that I mean it's very it's very obvious I mean um and you and and you know it's hard to sort of quantify I'm a baseball fan so I can quantify it like if you think about it in a pitchure and how fast they throw you know a small drop for them someone who's throwing 100 miles an hour just a small drop turns them you know from really Elite to someone mediocre maybe it's more of a 10% drop but but but it's still relatively small drop can have a a huge impact I think people think that just because you're a little bit off that's not going to that's not a big deal you kind of you kind of work through it and that's what most doctors say you just just just plow through it just just work your way through it you're going to get better and um as opposed to saying yeah you really had a brain injury um this is what happened we need to rehabilitate you just like we would do if you tore your anterior crucial ligament I don't know why teing your crucial ligament or your kiles tending gets more interest than than tearing axons in in your brain it's it's it's amazing to me that that there's more emphasis on Orthopedic injuries than than brain injuries yeah I don't know why that is either I think the brain is mysterious enough that um most people and and um many clinicians just kind of back away with hands raised but if you are in the field of Neurology or Psychiatry I suppose that then one has officially signed on to try and resolve these matters um so for somebody that um has a traumatic brain injury or or low-level con concussion excuse me um would part of the uh primary advice be to try and get one's sleep as as good as possible given that sleep deprivation can compound um traumatic brain injury uh induce deficits in working memory and who knows maybe a good portion of the deficits in working memory due to um traumatic brain injury and concussion is because of the sleep deprivation that it can cause so it get it can get circular know not only that but one of the most common symptoms that patients my patient with C have is is their sleep is disruptive they they they're and that's true in neurology it's fascinating almost every neurological disorder my patients complain their sleep and and I started asking you know not a lot of neurologists ask you how your sleep you know but I real I remember back from my residency one of the first things my attending would do when we got to the ward is said I just sleep last night and it just across the board you know patients are not falling asleep they're not staying asleep and it's it's uh we still don't understand why just brain injury does that so almost every concussion patient says I'm not sleeping well which then compounds you know compounds the problem so optimizing sleep obviously optimizing nutrition um there's a a question about activity it used to be that uh we used to recommend you know you had a concussion you should you should s don't go to work you know sleep you know just just take it easy for a while don't exercise keep the BL blind strong but now it's it's it's the idea is that you should really get up and moving as best you got to you got to do what you can tolerate you don't want to give yourself a you you don't want to give yourself more of a headache or more light sensitivity but as much as you can tolerate is is the the thought these days about sort of promoting recovery and then really getting your brain back working I think you know a lot of my patients they're off from work for a couple weeks and they they feel fine and they they think they're pretty much normal and the first day of work is a complete disaster because until you actually test it in real life you don't know how what kind of troubles you have so I don't recommend going back full steam but I do recommend going back trying to build up these these Stills skills again and then I think we you I think we need to develop therapies that people will will use um you know things like goal Management training which involves a therapist and you know health insurance doesn't pay for this so 99% of my my patients don't get any help you know by any kind of intervention uh unfortunately but now we talked about technology things like um brain HQ do you know about brain HQ so Mike merenik um which I know you've talked about with with Eddie um developed a a a company called posit science where where developed these brain training games that that can help improve specific cognitive functions and they're very easy to do because they're online and they you know they're there's science behind them and and you can you can do them so that in that way you don't have a therapist in your room but you can online sort of do these sort of things that are targeting specific Mech mechanisms to trying to improve the kind of things that we think are impaired by concussion and I'd like to see more patients get started on some of those things unfortunately if you go on the web and just say I won do brain training you'll be overwhelmed with things and you don't know what works and what doesn't work I I think the work that merenik and colleagues have done we'll provide a link to that I don't have any Financial stake in his in his work or products um trainings that is um but I will say I think Mike's work has been um tremendous I mean he is so far ahead of the curve 20 years ago everyone was talking about neuroplasticity in critical periods um they gave a Nobel Prize to it to my scientific great-grandparents David hubel and Toren and weasel um and they deserved that Nobel Prize but there was a kind of a central tenant of neuroscience at that time was that critical period plasticity ends around adolescence or one's early 20s and that is simply not true and merenik really I think one of the people who deserves credit for um making it clear that plasticity is ongoing it takes some focus and and work to access it in adulthood but that we can all access neuroplasticity but it it takes it's there so I don't know they should give merenik and Nobel too but you know I'm not on the committee so um just a little

There's always a lot of questions about, \"How long, how much, how do I know if I've had enough?\" You'll know because your rhythm will start to fall into some degree of normalcy, you'll start to wake up at more or less the same time each day, you'll fall asleep more easily at night, generally, it takes about two or three days for these systems to align, so if you've not been doing these behaviors, it's gonna take a few days, but they can have tremendous benefits, and sometimes rather quickly, on a number of different mental and physical aspects of your health. Now let's talk about the bad effects of light because light is not supposed to arrive in our system at any time, and nowadays, because of screens and artificial light, we have access to light at times of day and night that normally we wouldn't. Now, earlier I said that you need a lot of light, in particular, sunlight, to set these clock mechanisms, that's true, but there's a kind of diabolical feature to the way all of this works, which is the longer you've been awake, the more sensitive your retina and these cells are to light, so that if you've been awake for 10, 12, 14 hours, it becomes very easy for even a small amount of light coming from a screen or from an overhead light to trigger the activation of the clock"}

I want to be clear, there are amazing people there. But philanthropy and foundations have been very important in supporting pioneering research, and so maybe we just talk a little bit about that? So your lab receives funding from taxpayer dollars through the National Institutes of Health? Is that mainly where your funding comes from? - So our group has gotten some funding from like, say, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, NIDA. For some, a small subset of the psychedelic work, but only for some work geared towards understanding these things as drugs of abuse. - Right. - Of course, when you do a study, though, - Explore how they're bad. - Right. - Right, right. But when you're doing that, you can explore like the good stuff too. But the large majority of the work, and the most interesting work, has been funded by philanthropy. - Private philanthropy. - Now, I still have some grant support from NIDA outside of psychedelics. - Right. - I'm shifting more and more of my time towards focusing only on psychedelics. And in fact, us getting the center-level funding from some really big picture philanthropists helped me to start to make that transition. But groups like the Heffter Research organization, Dennis McKenna, which is one of the founding members, the brother of Terence McKenna, who is, by the way, an ethnobotanist. That's what his PhD is in. - What does that mean, ethnobtanist? - Studying, essentially, the anthropology of psychoactive plant use. So, you know- - Wow! You can get a degree in that? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, hanging out with cultures, and studying their use of these compounds in the traditional ways. - Wow! At Hopkins? That degree exists at Johns Hopkins? - I don't think that degree exists at Hopkins, - Oh, okay. - but I mean, kind of the most... As you know from academia, I'm not... You know, sometimes folks... I'm not sure how many people's PhD is actually in ethnobotany, or if it's actually in - Yeah, I've never heard of- - something else. But the real focus is... My degree is general experimental psychology. - Ten thousand kids out there just decided they're going to major in ethnobotany, but, you know- - I mean, one of the pioneers of the psychedelic area, before Leary, and before, and actually, he was late, even for the human researchers. Folks like Humphry Osmond, and Abram Hoffer, and Sidney Cohen were earlier. But even before those folks, Richard Schultes at Harvard, I mentioned him earlier in the conversation, discovered all of this now. These various tribes using ayahuasca or yagé, a different name for the same thing, throughout South America, and these DMT containing snuffs, and all of this. So that was ethnobotany, this kind of intersection of anthropology and these psychoactive plant compounds. So the Heffter Research Institute, which Dennis is a founding and active member of, a board member, they have funded a lot of our early work. There's also an organization called the Beckley Institute based in England, that a lady, Amanda Feilding, has been the head of, that has... They provided the first funding for our psilocybin smoking cessation research, and then Heffter came in and provided subsequent funding. And then there are other groups. The Council on Spiritual Practices. A great guy named Bob Jesse funded some of the original work at Hopkins, looking at the nature of mystical experience outside of treating disease states or disorders. But just understanding these... Like people take these compounds, and astonishingly, frequently, will say, that was the most important thing I've ever experienced. And it's like, what the hell is that? You know? - I had someone mention recently, and I think this might surprise people a little bit. It's certainly surprised me. I had a friend who adores his children. He's got three children. He adores his children. Happy marriage and a great father. They're both great parents. And he told me, that as part of a clinical trial, he had a DMT experience that he claims, he said, \"I'd love to tell you that the birth of my children was as profound, but that was a more profound experience than the birth of my children, any one of them and all of them combined\". And I was like, \"Wow!\" Now, I've never done DMT, but I was like, \"Wow, that's a pretty strong statement\". Now, he did it in the context of one of these clinical explorations I assume that was part of a legal clinical trial. I mean, that's saying something. - Yeah. - It's saying something. I mean, he's a very rational, very grounded guy, otherwise. So philanthropy foundations. - Yeah. - And then in- - Most recently, and sorry, just I can't, - Mm-hmm, yeah. - 'cause I can't skip it. Our center level funding - Oh, yeah, you can't skip- - which came at a year and a half, - I see. - that's like, we... I mean, the Heffter group, the Beckley group, I mean, these are wonderful. I mean, these are people that have been holding the flame alive during the darkest hours. Same thing with the MAPS organization more on the MDMA side, like holding that candle during the darkest years. You know, so we've... Smaller organizations connected to smaller, but growing over time, pockets of wealth. But we basically limped along on a wing and a prayer until recently, when we got the $17 million gift, so that we could create a nominal center. And as you know, basically, to the university, that means you get a certain number of dollars, and a lot of them, you can call yourself a center. It's a capital investment. Staff, equipment, salary, support, which has always been the huge thing for us. But the $17 million gift, which was split between the Cohen foundation, so Steven and Alexandra Cohen, they covered half of it, and the other half, the Tim Ferriss collaborative. Basically, Tim and a few friends ponied up, divided the rest of that, half of that $17 million gift, and came together to just... I mean, it's completely transformed our, the work that we've done, and our ability to fully delve into this area, and not worry that, like, oh, if I focus on this, rather than putting another three NIDA grants on some other topic that may or may not get funded, if I focus too much on the psychedelics, am I putting my career at jeopardy? Like so- - But you're now not only a tenured professor, you're also a full endowed- - Right. So that came- - By the way, when you say somebody is a fully endowed professor, - I want to be very clear what that means. That means that there's funding- - Well, it might mean all of the above, but no, I'm joking [laughs]. - I have no knowledge of your particular situation, but you probably do. - Just kidding. - But sure. What we're essentially saying, is that funding, which does not change somebody's salary level... I just want to be clear, 'cause I think the general public isn't... There's no reason why they would understand all the nuts and bolts of how this works. - Academia is weird. - Yeah. Academia is weird, because we're not talking about increasing. We're not talking about an endowment or philanthropy that went to increase Matt's salary. That something that's set at the university level. It's always been said, and it is, at least, is still true now, which is that nobody goes into science for the money, at least not at the academic level, not in academia. But allows people to devote more of their time and energy to these exploratory realms, like psychedelic research, or the case of my lab, the work that we're doing with David Spiegel's lab, on respiration breath work and hypnosis for modulating brain states. These are not typically areas that the National Institutes of Health and other major organizations have, institutions set up to support. Now, there is an exciting initiative, which is the NCCIH, which is Complimentary Health. - Right. Used to be NCCAM. - Yep. - Yeah, and they changed their name. - At NIH. - Yeah. - And now, we're not just throwing out acronyms just to bat back and forth acronyms. But I think what we're looking, what we're seeing now is a movement toward science, and scientists, and clinicians, and the general public, and philanthropy being engaged in this dialogue, which says, okay, there are problems in the world, depression, head trauma, psychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD. These problems clearly exist. The solutions are going to involve behaviors that are going to involve nutrition, supplementation, social connection. However, there are drugs, there are compounds that can change the brain, and allow the brain to change its circuitry through experience, and psychedelics are one of several others, but one of the powerful leavers, it sounds like. And I just want to say, that I think the reason I reached out to you, and I'm so excited to sit down and chat with you is, because I see very few people inside the halls of academia who have thrown their arms around this issue of psychedelics in a way, and gone through the trouble of trying to find the funding to get it done, gone through the trouble of trying to set up clinical trials. I know what's involved in doing this. It's so complicated. It's so time-consuming and painstaking. And you've made real progress. I mean, you guys are publishing papers. There's a new dialogue emerging that isn't just books on bookshelves and psychedelic, psychonaut gurus on the internet, who also play an important role. But you're really moving this field forward. And I know there are others as well. There are colleagues in England and others as well. We acknowledge them. But I just want to say personally, that I'm inspired and impressed by the way that you've gone about this, and the level of rigor. I mean, when I ask you a question about serotonin, most people will just kind of kick back to me, well, yeah, you got receptors, and you've got a ligand, but I mean, it's clear to me that you care about the details, and that you care about the future of this area, and you also really care about these patients and these individuals. So I know I'm speaking on behalf of a ton of people now, and in the future, that don't even know what they're going to receive as a consequence of this. I just want to voice a real sincere thank you for that effort. It's like your lab and your work matters, and that's a really special and unique thing. - I appreciate that. In fact, I had a good colleague, in fact, she shared some grants support under the multi-PI system years ago, and she actually took a job at NIH as a review officer. And I remember her telling me... And she actually left when she had multiple RO1s. So it's like- - RO1s are kind of the bread and butter, - Big picture grant. - big grants - Yeah. - that every card carrying... It's a mark of respect in our community to have one or several of these, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. It's like you eat what you kill in academia. It gets to what we were talking about later, it's like you don't make more money by pulling more grants, but you're able to pay the salary that... The university doesn't pay you your salary. It goes through them. - Right. You're just able to do more work. - Yeah. - Yeah. - And you're able to... And if you don't pull in the grants to cover your salary, your job can come to an end. Even if you're tenured at a place like Hopkins, they can do tricks, like slowly lower your salary over- - Well, they just let- Or they just take away your space. - Yeah, they put you in a closet, and give you no support for trainees, and basically make life hell for you. So you can drive - It happens. - a cab in Baltimore, and call yourself a full professor at Hopkins, truthfully, but you may not have no ability to get anything done. - I'm sure they're out there. - But yeah, I remember one of the things this colleague has said, who's is successful, but left on top said, \"I really don't know that I'm making a difference in the world?\" And she did some great memory research and connected to drugs, also connected to aging. But she said, \"I don't feel the impact of what I'm doing in the real world\". Unfortunately, there, for a lot of academia, what we do, it stays in the ivory tower. The world is a... - Not anymore. - It's a beautiful, but messed up place, and a lot of this doesn't disseminate, - Right. - because of the various structures, the way the world is set up. And thankfully, this... I mean, because the work that our group, as well as a few others around the world, over the last 20 years, it's like you do have an emerging psychedelic startup industry now with billions of dollars of investment. And yeah, that's going to turn into both good and bad. You know, it's upping the ante. There's going to be a lot of good and bad that comes from that, - Sure. - but any new technology is going to result in that. But we've got psilocybin designated for two separate entities as a breakthrough therapy by the FDA, and people may not realize, and the MDMA is designated as a breakthrough therapy for PTSD. This is a really big deal. That's a very high... I mean, pharma companies would pay millions of dollars to get their new drug a designation like that. And what it means, is early research is showing, saying it shows a high potential for treating disorders that don't have very good treatments. And we're probably, again, a few years away from both MDMA, probably a year or two, after that psilocybin, and being treated for PTSD and depression respectively. You know, we have to wait for the Phase 3 studies, but if the results hold up... Even if the effect size is halved of what we're seeing now, it's still going to be a lot larger than what you're seeing with the traditional medications. And so it's going to be approved, if the data hold up, and it probably will from my judgment. So I feel like what I'm doing is actually having a positive impact in the world in a way that... And I feel lucky that I got interested in an area that happens to plug into a place in the world where there is that opportunity, where some great colleagues and friends are focused on areas where I wish they had the opportunity for their work to be disseminated. I mean, I was lucky to be interviewed on \"60 Minutes\" because of this work. And I was like, oh, my god, I know so many... There's a bit of imposter syndrome, like, oh, my god, I know so many scientists that deserve, more so than me, to be, had that level of exposure. But if you happen to be in that place where, you got to do your best to make it work, to take advantage of that luck, and that intersection of the world, and to push it. I've been lucky, but I also did take a bit of a leap of faith early on. I did have some advisors that told me, like, you've got a really promising pedigree early on, like, are you sure you want to focus much time on this psychedelic stuff? - Yeah, you've embraced risk. I mean, I think that... I mean, the world's changed since, in 2020, certainly, but channels like social media, podcasts, and things of that sort, your exposure is because people are interested in these topics, and that's why people, like myself, are interested in talking to you. I mean at Stanford, there are now a few labs starting to explore psychedelics, more at the mechanistic level, so in animal models. Some excellent labs. But also, I can imagine, because of the pioneering work that you've done at Hopkins, it'll start to become more common. I'm certain that people are going to have questions about how to get in contact with you and learn more."}
{"question": "Can deliberately dilating one's gaze to create tunnel vision and then expanding vision to a broader panoramic view have a calming effect on the mind when the body is in a high state of activation, such as during intense exercise?", "doc_id": "ntfcfJ28eiU_23", "video_id": "ntfcfJ28eiU", "video_title": "Tools for Managing Stress & Anxiety", "video_header": "Use Vision to Calm the Mind When the Body Is Agitated", "segment_idx": "23", "time_start": "59:51", "time_end": "1:02:31", "context": "The effect of that pupil dilation is to create tunnel vision. It literally narrows our view of the visual world. We no longer see in Panorama. And there's some other effects as well. But that's because the visual system through this cranial nerve system that I described before is tethered and is part of this autonomic nervous system. By deliberately dilating your gaze, meaning not moving your head and eyes around, but by deliberately going from tunnel vision to broader panoramic vision, literally seeing more of your environment all at once. You don't have to do what I'm doing, which is not blinking. You're welcome to blink. But it means deliberately dilating your gaze so that you can see yourself in the environment you're in. It creates a calming effect on the mind because it releases a particular circuit in the brainstem that's associated with alertness, aka stress. Now, this is very powerful. If you're running, for instance, and you're at max capacity or close to it, or you're kind of hitting like 80, 90% of maximum on the bike and you dilate your gaze, what you'll find is the mind can relax while the body is in full output. And this relates to work that in various communities, people are working with this in the sports community, military community, et cetera. But it's a form, not really of stress inoculation, it's more about raising stress threshold so that the body is going to continue to be in a high alertness, high reactivity mode, high output, but the mind is calm. And so, this isn't about unifying mind and body. This is actually about using body to bring up your level of activation, then dissociating, not the clinical dissociation kind of disorders, but dissociating the mental or emotional response from what's going on in your body. And over time, so if you do this a couple of times, you don't have to do this every workout, but if you do this every maybe once a week or so, you start being comfortable at these higher activation states. What once felt overwhelming and like a lot of work, now is manageable. It feels tolerable. So, that's for navigating medium-term stress. Now, there are other tools as well, but we don't want to go over 90 minutes because 90 minutes is one old trading cycle. I was trying to keep these podcasts to one on trading cycle, in case you haven't noticed, so you can derive maximum benefit from them based on all trading and cycle principles of learning. So, I don't want to go into every little bit of this. And I want to make sure we get to emotions. But I want to emphasize that these medium-term stressors, of, \"Oh, it's been a hard month, or hard week.\" Stanford's on the quarter system. So 10 weeks or semester. That becomes more manageable when we train ourselves to be calm of mind when our body is activated. And if you haven't noticed, most of the tools I'm describing today are nothing like the sort of, okay, sit and do meditation."}
{"question": "Can wearing sunscreen completely block the increase in testosterone and estrogen caused by sunlight exposure to the skin, and if not, what are the recommended precautions to take to minimize sunburn while still getting the benefits of UVB light?", "doc_id": "UF0nqolsNZc_12", "video_id": "UF0nqolsNZc", "video_title": "Using Light (Sunlight, Blue Light & Red Light) to Optimize Health | Huberman Lab Podcast #68", "video_header": "Tool: Skin Sun Exposure & Testosterone", "segment_idx": "12", "time_start": "1:02:14", "time_end": "1:06:08", "context": "Now, this study went a step further in defining the precise mechanism by which light can impact all these hormones and this desire to mate. And here, understanding the mechanism is key if you want to export a particular protocol or tool that you might apply. We talked earlier about how UVB light exposure to the eyes triggers activation of these particular neurons within the eye, and then with centers deeper in the brain, and eventually the pineal gland to suppress the output of melatonin and thereby to allow testosterone and estrogen to exist at higher levels because melatonin can inhibit testosterone and estrogen. In this study, they were able to very clearly establish that it is sunlight exposure to our skin that is causing these hormone increases that they observed in mice and humans. And the way they did that was to use the so-called knockout technology, the ability to remove specific genes within specific tissues of the body. And what they found is that UVB light, meaning sunlight-exposed skin, upregulated, meaning increased the activity of something called p53, which is involved in the maturation of cells and various aspects of cellular function. And the cells they were focused on were the keratinocytes, which you are now familiar with from our earlier discussion about the fact that the epidermis of your skin contains mainly keratinocytes and melanocytes. Sunlight exposure increased p53 activity in the skin. And p53 activity was required for the downstream increases in ovarian size, in testicular size, in testosterone increases, in the estrogen increases, and the various other changes that they observed at the physiological level when animals or humans were exposed to sunlight. So these data are important because what they mean is that not only is it important that we get sunlight exposure early in the day and throughout the day to our eyes, at least as much as is safely possible, but that we also need to get UVB sunlight exposure onto our skin if we want to activate this p53 pathway in keratinocytes and the testosterone and estrogen increases that are downstream of that p53 pathway. So even though the gene knockout studies were done on mice, they clearly show that if you remove p53 from the skin, that these effects simply do not occur. So in terms of thinking about a protocol to increase testosterone and estrogen, mood and feelings of passion, the idea is that you would want to get these two to three exposures per week, minimum of 20 to 30 minutes of sunlight exposure onto as much of your body as you can reasonably expose it to. And when I say reasonably, I mean, of course you have to obey cultural constraints, decency constraints. And of course you have to also obey the fact that sunlight can burn your skin. So many people are probably going to ask, \"What happens if you wear sunscreen?\" Well, in theory, because sunscreen has UV protection, it would block some of these effects. Now I'm not suggesting that people do away with sunscreen entirely. I do hope to do an episode all about sunscreen in the future because sunscreen is a bit of a controversial topic. Skin cancers are a real thing, and many people are especially prone to skin cancer, so you need to take that seriously. Some people are not very prone to skin cancers and can tolerate much more sun exposure. You're probably familiar with the simple fact that if you've gone outside on the beach with friends, some people get burned very easily, others don't. So you really should prioritize the health and the avoidance of sunburn on your skin. However, these data and other data point to the fact that we should all probably be striving to get more sunlight exposure onto our skin during the winter months and still getting sunlight exposure onto our skin in the summer months, provided we can do that without damaging our skin. Another set of very impressive effects of UVB light,"}

powerfully change outcomes for the better and can do so in a huge variety of real world contexts and the work that I'm referring to is the work of a person named David Yeager Dr David Yeager is a professor at the University of Texas Austin he did his graduate work with Carol dweck at Stanford and he now has his own laboratory in Austin and both when he was a graduate student with Carol and in his own laboratory he's been doing very impressive large-scale studies meaning many thousands of subjects so that itself is important and using subjects from diverse areas rural urban Etc different levels of affluence lack of affluence and finding essentially that when students are taught about a growth mindset what it is how it's different than a fixed mindset and when those same students are also taught about what a stress is enhancing mindset is and cultivating that again simply through information tutorial watching a video about growth mindset watching a video about stress is enhancing mindsets and then confronted with stress confronted with Tess confronted with opportunities to embrace hard challenges or easier paths across the board the results show up again and again as students who are taught about a growth mindset and are taught that stress is enhancing perform better now jaegering colleagues have shown that across a huge number of different experiments in fact there's a paper published quite recently this was about a year ago in July of 2022 in the journal Nature so Apex Journal published as a full article in Nature and Science and elsewhere they have letters and shorter formats like reports and then there are the Articles which correspond to major major findings so they published The Following results as an article in nature in July of 2022 the title of the paper is a synergistic mindsets intervention protects adolescents from stress and what I absolutely love about this paper is that it includes a lot of different kinds of experiments so for instance they looked at high school students who simply anticipated a stressful event and had been instructed on growth mindset or stress's enhancing mindset or both or control conditions where they weren't informed of those mindsets right It's always important to have control experiments where you're getting the same amount of information but it's not the same information and what they found was that anticipatory stress right the stress that we feel in anticipation of something that we think is going to happen is reduced when we are educated about growth mindset and we are educated about a stress's enhancing mindset and the basic takeaway from that experiment was yes indeed being educated on what a growth mindset is and how it differs from a fixed mindset which you now have been educated on definitely buffers you against stress in addition being educated on how stress can enhance performance can buffer you against anticipatory stress but it is clearly the case that when one is educated on both of those things growth mindset and stresses enhancing mindsets that one observes the greatest buffering or offset of the stress response in ways that can improve performance now that is but one experiment of the six yes six experiments included in this single Paper now I'm not going to go through each of those six experiments in detail and just as a side note I've invited Dr David Yeager to be a guest on this podcast and he has agreed so when he's a guest on this podcast I'm sure he will detail all the intricacies of those experiments in order to inform us about exactly what was done and how so that we can benefit from that information but just by way of example another experiment in this paper use what was called the trigger social stress test and the reason I'm going to highlight this a little bit is because I think it relates to a lot of things that many of us have experienced and that will experience that are considered stressful and of course we would all like ways to buffer ourselves against stress and or leverage that stress to improve our performance as well as adopt a growth mindset so the try our social stress test is a kind of standard mode of stressing people out in the laboratory or in the classroom where basically a subject comes in you tell them to wait a little bit of time then you measure their stress response at rest you're looking at their heart rate their blood pressure you might have them spit into a little tube and use that saliva to measure cortisol because that's how you measure cortisol then you're going to tell them that they're going to prepare a speech for presentation in front of a small group of actual people then they actually have to deliver that speech in front of that audience during that speech sometimes the people who are observing it are giving feedback like frowns crossed arms Etc then there's a pop quiz where they get a hard arithmetic test in front of that audience and when they get answer is wrong they're told they're wrong in front of that audience this all might seem kind of playful and silly to you but most people do not experience this as playful and silly almost everybody who goes into one of these experiments as a subject feel some level of stress especially those that don't like public speaking especially those that don't see themselves as very proficient in arithmetic or that don't like to work out problems in real time in front of people you can see how this would be stressful and all the while measures of psychological and physiological reactivity are being measured peripheral blood flow the thing we talked about earlier among those what I just described is pretty extensive but I provide all that as a backdrop so that you can understand what happened before which was people were simply educated on growth mindset how it differs from fixed mindset and or stress enhances performance mindset or not so basically what we have here is a condition in which people are just getting information right there's no pill there's no treadmill there's no going home and doing a bunch of problem sets and what they observe in this experiment and all the other experiments contained within this quite massive paper is that the mere learning about growth mindset and stresses enhancing mindsets allows these students to shift their physiology so enhance peripheral blood flow changes in hormone secretion like cortisol n shifts in their psychology such that when they feel stressed they start to see that and experience that as an opportunity for Challenge and to lean into that challenge and where they are told that they got the wrong answer where they are told that they are not performing well they are able to think about that and to allocate their mental resources such that they do start to perform better and the major takeaway from the study is that across the board in all six experiments in Imagine stress in real stress laboratory stress actual classroom stress and in embracing future challenges just the learning about what stress can enhance your performance mindset is allowed students to do just that now another really interesting feature of this study put

I'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today we are discussing memory. In particular, how to improve your memory. Now the study of memory is one that dates back many decades, and by now there's a pretty good understanding of how memories are formed in the brain. The different structures involved and some of the neuro chemicals involved. And we will talk about some of that today. Often overlooked, however, is that memories are not just about learning. Memories are also about placing your entire life into a context. And that's because what's really special about the brain and in particular the human brain, is its ability to place events in the context of past events, the present, and future events. And sometimes even combinations of the past and present. Or present and future and so on. So when we talk about memory what we're really talking about is how your immediate experiences relate to previous and future experiences. Today I'm going to make clear how that process occurs. Even if you don't have a background in biology or psychology, I promise to put it into language that anyone can access and understand. And we are going to talk about the science that points to specific tools for enhancing learning and memory. We're also going to talk about unlearning and forgetting. There are of course incidences in which we would like to forget things. And that too is a biological process for which great tools exist. To, for instance, eliminate or at least reduce the emotional load of a previous experience that you really did not like, or that perhaps even was traumatic to you. So today you're going to learn about the systems in the brain and body that establish memories. You're going to learn why certain memories are easier to form than others. And I'm going to talk about specific tools that are grounded in not just one, not just a dozen, but well over 100 studies in animals and humans that point to specific protocols that you can use in order to stamp down learning of particular things more easily. And you can also leverage that same knowledge to better forget or unload the emotional weight of experiences that you did not like. We're also going to discuss topics like deja vu and photographic memory. And for those of you that do not have a photographic memory, and I should point out that I do not have a photographic memory, either. Well, you will learn how to use your visual system in order to better learn visual and auditory information. There are protocols to do this grounded in excellent peer reviewed research. So while you may not have a true photographic memory, by the end of the episode you will have tools in hand, or I should say, tools in mind or in eyes and mind, to be able to encode and remember specific events"}
{"question": "Can chronically increasing adrenaline levels actually hinder learning and memory, or is it the amount of adrenaline released relative to my current levels that matters?", "doc_id": "szqPAPKE5tQ_18", "video_id": "szqPAPKE5tQ", "video_title": "Understand & Improve Memory Using Science-Based Tools | Huberman Lab Podcast #72", "video_header": "Chronically High Adrenaline & Cortisol, Impact on Learning & Memory", "segment_idx": "18", "time_start": "1:12:36", "time_end": "1:15:11", "context": "And as a cautionary note, don't think that you can push this entire system to the extreme over and over again, or chronically, as we say, and get away with it. In other words, you're not going to be able to take a Alpha GPC and a double espresso do your focus about of work, cognitive or physical work, and then spike adrenaline again afterwards and remember that stuff you did better, right. I'm not encouraging you, in fact I'm discouraging you from chronically increasing adrenaline both during and after a given about of work if the goal is to learn. Why do I say that? Well, work from McGaugh and Cahill and others has shown that it's not the absolute amount of adrenaline that you release in your brain and body that matters for enhancing memory. It's the amount of adrenaline you release relative to the amount of adrenaline that was in your system just prior. Particularly in the hour or two prior. So again, it's the delta, as we say. It's the difference. So if you're going to chronically increase adrenaline you're not going to learn as well. The real key is to have adrenaline modestly low. Perhaps even just as much as you need in order to be able to focus on something, pay attention to it, and then spike it afterwards. This is immensely important because while much of what we're talking about is actually a form of inducing a neuro chemical acute stress. Meaning a brief and rapid onset of stress. Well, chronic stress, the chronic elevation of epinephrine and cortisol is actually detrimental to learning. And there's an entire category of literature mainly from the work of the great and sadly the late Bruce McEwen from the Rockefeller University. And some of his scientific offspring like the great Robert Sapolsky, showing that chronic stress, chronic elevation of epinephrine actually inhibits learning and memory. And also can inhibit immune system function. Whereas acute, right, sharp increases in adrenaline and cortisol actually can enhance learning and indeed, can enhance the immune system. So if you really want to leverage this information, you might consider getting your brain and body into a very calm and yet alert state. So a high attentional state that will allow you to focus on what it is that you're trying to learn. We know focus is vital for encoding information and for triggering neuroplasticity. But remaining calm throughout that time and then afterwards spiking adrenaline and allowing adrenaline to have these incredible effects on reducing the number of repetitions required to learn. So if you're like me, you're learning about this information this beautiful work of McGaugh and Cahill and others"}
{"question": "Can EMDR be used as a standalone treatment for trauma, or is it most effective when combined with other therapies, such as exposure-based treatments?", "doc_id": "PctD-ki8dCc_13", "video_id": "PctD-ki8dCc", "video_title": "Dr. David Spiegel: Using Hypnosis to Enhance Health & Performance", "video_header": "EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing)", "segment_idx": "13", "time_start": "1:15:38", "time_end": "1:21:41", "context": "a lot of interest out there about EMDR, Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing. - Yeah. - Shapiro herself was working, she wasn't at Stanford directly, but was the local to Stanford. - Yeah. - I think in Palo Alto. - MRI, yeah. - So what are your thoughts on EMDR? Where is it useful, where do you think it's less useful? Are there things that EMDR could be combined with to make it more useful? The listeners of this podcast come to, I think, come to the podcast with a range of backgrounds and interests. To me, it makes sense why EMDR, lateralized eye movements might work, given the newer data that it can suppress amygdala activity in some animals and animal models and in humans as well. But it really hasn't been explored much, neurally. I've heard things like, it coordinates the two sides of the brain, which it, to me is just a throwaway. I don't think there's any evidence that, coordinating the two sides of the brain is better than not coordinating. I wouldn't be speaking right now if the two sides of my brain, were well correlated. - Yeah. - Because language is lateralized so, - Right, exactly. - I heard that it mimics, rapid eye movements during sleep, but actually it doesn't. So, - Right. - But I have heard people talk about their positive experiences with EMDR. What are your thoughts about EMDR? - Yeah, you had a good comment on that in one of your recent podcasts. And I'll tell you, one way I sort of think about it from a bemused point of view, is the old, you mentioned it earlier, the oldest sort of idea of a hypnotic induction, was a dangling watch, right? And watch. And, in fact, there was enough concern about it that when automobiles were invented, there was a movement to prevent installing windshield wipers because people were afraid that they would be hypnotized, if they watched the windshield wipers go back and forth on a car. Now, it turns out fortunately that, you tend not to look at the windshield wipers. You keep looking through the windshield. And so, we have windshield wipers today. But that movement is, what exactly used to be a hypnotic induction. I think there is a lot of hypnosis in EMDR. - Ah. - And I think, it's a combination of that with exposure based treatments, where you use EMDR to think about it. You tend not to process the experience as much and just do the physical part of it, which I personally think is a drawback. And, every study I've seen that was a dismantling study. There's no question that people who go through EMDR, many of them get better with trauma related problems and the VA has a big program using it and so on. But every program that has dismantled, going through the treatment with having the lateral eye movement, has shown that the lateral eye movement, doesn't add anything to it. And toward the end of her career, Francine was doing contralateral touching or something, it wasn't eye movements anymore. It was other things. So, I tend to think that, EMDR is another form of exposure based therapy for trauma, but as you've implied with the exception of this possible new data, it certainly doesn't have to do with, rapid eye movement sleep. And I don't think moving the eyes is the issue. I think it's a way of sitting down and confronting trauma. And I would rather, that the trauma itself be processed a bit more than often happens in EMDR. So, a lot of people have gotten therapy. Some of them have been helped. Francine used to originally claim that just one session would desensitize people and do it. And that's clearly not true. I see a lot of people who said, yeah, it helped for a while but I need more. So, I think it became a kind of a, overly simplistic approach to understanding brain physiology and that part is wrong. And the interesting thing, you mentioned suppressing amygdala activity. It's very interesting that, my late friend Allen Hobson, who was a brilliant sleep researcher, you know Alan- - Sleep researcher. Well, I don't know him, but I read his book when I was in college about the chemistry of sleep. - Right. And the similarities between dream states and hallucinations. - Yes. - And it's one of the reasons I got into this business. - Yes, well, I worked with him in a MacArthur mind-body network for many years. - Wow. - He was a brilliant guy, points out that we need to get into, primarily a parasympathetic state to go to sleep, that we have to shut off the sympathetic nervous system. And that's why a loud noise wakes you up, when your heart rate goes up and all this. So, he was brilliant at documenting what happens in the brain at sleep. He pointed out something also very interesting about dreams, which is that the stories in dreams, and even the images in dreams can change all over the place in crazy ways. But usually the affect is constant, he said, usually if it's a frustration dream, whatever happens, you end up frustrated. And if it's a enjoyment dream, you enjoy whatever's going on. So, there's an odd consistency and affect in dreams that you don't have in other states. And the idea of lateral eye movement, suppressing amygdala activity would kind of fit with that, that you don't allow intrusions of fear and anger and upset in dreams. It may be there all the time, but it may not be there when you think it should be. So, why is it that you can be falling off a building and somehow not that scared, you're just having this experience of flying in a dream. So, I think there may be something going on about regulating affect, but there are, we have elaborated better ways to regulate affect. - Great, so EMDR, might incorporate some elements of hypnosis, so the lateralized eye movements, perhaps by way of suppressing the amygdala, this fear associated center, might bring people into a more parasympathetic calm state. So, it might be pseudo hypnosis, and then an exposure therapy through the discussion about the issue. - Right. - Okay. More research needed on EMDR out there. And obviously, something that's come up a lot in this discussion and in our discussions that, have the great fortune of talking to you every week is,"}

And they offer a number of different ways, I think many of which are useful, trying to get you to organize different types of habits into different bins, like value-based, and goal-based, and trying to persuade you that structuring habits at the particular times of day or in a particular way are going to be beneficial, and indeed, I think they have helped a lot of people.

{"question": "What are some specific practices that can increase adrenaline, epinephrine, and cortisol levels in the body, and how often should they be done to be beneficial?", "doc_id": "JPX8g8ibKFc_12", "video_id": "JPX8g8ibKFc", "video_title": "Using Cortisol & Adrenaline to Boost Our Energy & Immune System Function", "video_header": "Ways To Increase Adrenaline, Epinephrine & Cortisol & Why That Is Good", "segment_idx": "12", "time_start": "30:06", "time_end": "34:59", "context": "and to do it in a deliberate way. There are also ways to do that that increase your level of stress threshold, meaning they make it less likely that epinephrine and cortisol will be released. So I want to talk about the science of those practices, 'cause I get asked about these practices a lot. Things like Wim Hof breathing which is also called tummo breathing. Things like ice baths. Things like high intensity interval training. All of those things have utility. The question is how you use them and how often you use them. Those tools just like stress from a life event can either enhance your immunity or deplete it. That's right those same practices of ice baths, tummo breathing, high intensity interval training, or training of any kind can deplete your immune system or it can improve them. Excuse me, they can improve it, meaning they can improve your immune system. The key is how often you use them and when, and so I want to review that now in light of the scientific literature, because in doing that you can build practices into your daily or maybe every other day routine that can really help buffer you against unhealthy levels of cortisol and epinephrine. Meaning cortisol increases that are much too great, or that lasts much too long. Epinephrine increases that are much too great, or that last much too long. And of course we'll talk about all the negatives that go along with having too much cortisol, too much epinephrine for too long. But you hear about those a lot. You hear about Cushing syndrome, you hear about abdominal fat accumulation. You hear about sleep disturbances. I want to arm you with the tools first and then we can talk about the dark side, and all the things that hopefully you'll be able to avoid entirely, or that you can get yourself out of once you have the tools in hand. Let's say somebody tells you something very troubling, or you look at your phone and you see a text message that's really upsetting to you. That will cause an immediate increase in epinephrine adrenaline in your brain and body. And chances are it's going to increase your levels of cortisol as well. Let's say you get into an ice bath or a cold shower, even if you love the cold, or if you hate the cold, that will cause an equivalent increase in epinephrine and cortisol. We don't know the exact levels but it's probably about the same. Let's say you go out for high intensity interval training, you decide you're going to run some sprints, you do some repeats, or you're going to do some weightlifting in the gym and you love lifting weights in the gym. Maybe you like the power lifting thing, or you decide that you want to do some hot yoga, or some thing that you really enjoy, or you hate, you're going to increase your epinephrine and cortisol levels. There's simply no way around this. Let's say you decide to sit down and you're going to do some deep breathing. We all hear about the benefits of deep breathing. So inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale. You're going to get big increases in epinephrine and cortisol. The data from multiple studies support this. All of those are stressors in air quotes. Now there is a way that you can cognitively reframe what those are. You can tell yourself I love high intensity interval training, or I love weight training. I personally love exercise. I'm not crazy about the cold, I do some cold exposure stuff now and again, and we're going to talk a lot about how to do that in the optimal way in an upcoming episode. But you know, getting into the cold doesn't feel good to me. I tell myself it's good for me and I enjoy it at some point usually when I'm getting out. All of those increase epinephrine and guess what, they increase your levels of energy and alertness. So if you're somebody who struggles with energy and alertness it can be beneficial, provided you get clearance from your doctor to have some sort of protocol built into your day where you deliberately increase your levels of epinephrine and your levels of cortisol. And I want to put the emphasis on deliberately. So how would you do that? Well, it's quite easy to turn the shower cold and get into that, that will wake you up. And it literally wakes you up because of increases in epinephrine. You can do deep breathing of the sort where you inhale and exhale repeatedly 25 or 30 times, maybe hold your breath for a few seconds on an exhale and then repeat, so-called Wim Hoff, or tummo type breathing. Lots of adrenaline is released into your system when you do that. You will have more energy afterwards. So it's really important to understand that the body doesn't distinguish between a troubling text message, ice, tummo breathing, or high intensity interval training, or any other kind of exercise, it's all stress. Cognitively reframing that and telling yourself I like this, I enjoy it. Is not going to change the way that that molecule impacts your body and brain. I sort of chuckle because people would love to tell you that all you have to do is say, \"Oh, this is good for me.\" No. What it does to tell yourself that it's good for you or that you enjoy it. Is that it liberates other molecules"}

we have testosterone estrogen growth hormone cortisol Etc there's a study that was carried out in humans in which subjects were informed about growth hormone release and cortisol release growth hormone is a hormone released from a gland in the brain called the pituitary the pituitary has different parts the anterior pituitary releases growth hormone each night when you go to sleep it's involved in protein synthesis tissue repair bodily growth appendage growth and many other things cortisol is a hormone that's released from the adrenals it can also be synthesized and released a couple other places in the brain and body and it's involved in immune system function in anti-inflammatory action a lot of people think cortisol is bad but it's actually an important hormone for our daily Health our alertness and waking up in the morning Etc in any event subjects in this study learned about growth hormone and cortisol and their release where they're released from what they do just as you did and then their growth hormone and cortisol levels were measured and not surprisingly they didn't change just learning about growth hormone and cortisol did not change growth hormone or cortisol levels in these human subjects now on days two and three of this experiment subjects received an injection of a drug the drug is called sumatriptan and sumatriptan is known to increase levels of growth hormone and reduce levels of cortisol and indeed that's what they observed when people received these injections and then their blood was drawn growth hormone levels went up cortisol levels went down now the interesting part of the study is a separate day okay so after the drug treatments they come back and they are injected with saline which has no specific biologic effect it's simply saltwater okay they're injected with saline and they experience increases in growth hormone and decreases in cortisol which on the face of it might seem like wow that's incredible but based on what you've learned thus far in today's episode you could imagine that knowledge about growth hormone and cortisol somehow combined with the injection to lead to an expectation of increases in growth hormone and decreases in cortisol which would be amazing in its own r right okay after all saline is inert it doesn't do anything directly and specifically to the growth hormone or cortisol system but get this it turns out that a saline injection which does nothing on its own on day four or five after people have received this drug treatment increases growth hormone and decreases cortisol independent of what people are told they are being injected with even if they are told they are being injected with a drug that has completely different effects than sumatriptan so why would this be how could this be in fact there was even a condition in which subjects were told on the day they receed the placebo you're about to get an injection of something that's going to decrease growth hormone but rather they experienced a genuine increase in growth hormone and decrease in cortisol in the exact same way they did when they received the active drug Summa triptan okay so this wild type of scenario has to be explained and in order to explain it we need to zoom out from the experiment and ask what's the similarity between Day 2 and three of the experiment meaning the days in which the people received the actual active drug sumatriptan that increases growth hormone reduces cortisol and the day in which they receive the placebo and the one thing that anchors both those days together meaning the one thing in common that can explain this effect is that those were the days in which people received an injection and in fact through various control experiments and a few other experiments that were done subsequent to this because this experiment has been more or less repeated in different forms in different Laboratories it became clear that the brain and body somehow came to expect that receiving an injection leads to increases in growth hormone and cortisol now this is not an indefinite effect right people will get injections of other things in the future presumably active drugs not just saline that will change hormone levels or change neurotransmitter levels but in this experiment what happened is is is that there was a pairing within the nervous system there was a somehow a binding of the notion of getting an injection with a syringe which in the first case was of a drug that increases growth hormone decreases cortisol and then when subjects came back and were injected with a different syringe presumably I would hope so with a different syringe filled with saline even though the saline should do nothing the body and brain had somehow formed a pairing an association between syringe injection and increased growth hormone decreased cortisol which is incredible given that these systems the anterior pituitary the adrenal glands I mean these are ancient systems that to our knowledge we can't directly control with our mind I can't simply like close my eyes and grit my teeth and cause the release of growth hormone I can't simply decide to deploy cortisol from my adrenals although if I thought about something very very stressful for a long time there'd probably be some cortisol secretion but to our knowledge there is no way to use thoughts to use beliefs to use understanding of knowledge to cause changes in our endocrine glands right our hormone glands the pituitary the adrenals but here we have a case where a drug that increases certain hormones and decreases other hormones simply by virtue of the fact that it was injected into somebody leads to a case where subsequent injections at least in the short run lead to the exact same hormone changes simply because in the mind and or body of these individuals injection comes to equal increase in growth hormone decrease in cortisol independent of what's being injected now a key point is that had on the final day of the experiment the subject's been injected with a different drug that for instance you know increases serotonin or reduces epinephrine I doubt that they would have instead experienced increases in growth hormone and reductions in cortisol that's simply not the case the fact that there was only saline in there meant that there was an opportunity for the the syringe and the injection we don't know which to lead to some sort of pair dissociation in the brain and body that led to increased growth hormone decreased cortisol which mimic the drug effect but the whole scenario here as wild as it is really speaks to the fact that often times we think a given treatment is causing a given effect only because of the action of the drug or the action of a given behavioral protocol but in fact the drug and the protocol exist in a big context of different things that the brain and body are integrating and trying to make sense of and that often gets lumped together I often say that your brain is yes a prediction machine but it's also trying to simplify things in those predictions it's not taking into account all the information it's often lumping information together and coming up with ideas about what's going to happen and why and doing this subconsciously in a way that as you just learned can have profound effects on what happens within us even at the level of something as basic as hormone release now what I just described is a pretty extreme example"}

So we roll into a case, and I hadn't had anything go bad at that point in time. Very next case, a Burnham-Sobero case by a different faction of the terrorist group, 13 months later ends up in two of the three remaining hostages shot and killed by friendly fire along the way. Hostages had been executed. An American had been executed early on, and it was a train wreck, and lots of people got killed all along the way, and just really ridiculous bad things happening. And that was bad all the way through. So learned a lot from it, went back and checked everything we did, and we didn't do anything wrong that we felt based on our strategy, didn't miss anything. And that was why I ended up going collaborating with the guys at Harvard, because my reaction was, if we did everything we know how to do and it wasn't enough, that means we're not smart enough, we got to get better. And so that case taught me a lot about the dynamics that really happen on the other side and the difference between whether or not people are really on your side. The US government was not highly collaborative. The Philippine government was not highly collaborative. Everybody wanted to get their pound of flesh out of the other side. I mean, just everything bad that you can imagine. Early on, when Guillermo Sobero was murdered by the Abu Sayyaf, it was a national holiday in the Philippines, and the bad guys had a history of killing people on national holidays, and we weren't from the Philippines, and we had no idea that that day was a national holiday. And we showed up at Philippine National Police Headquarters, in Manila, and it was closed. Now I got an ongoing hostage case with bad guys threatening to kill hostages. And we show up at the gates, and the gates are closed, and we're like, what the hell's going on here? Well, it's a national holiday. Nobody's working today. I'm like, first of all, nobody told us that. Secondly, I don't think the bad guys really care that it's a national holiday and nobody's working. Our negotiator is nowhere to be found. We got a guy there that the previous negotiator we worked with, Philippine National Police, was not that happy that they didn't have him under complete control. So they give us a guy that will not tell us anything until after he's told them. So he's having conversations with the bad guys, and we're actually hearing about him secondhand. He didn't show up that day. And, of course, that day, the bad guys announced they're going to kill a hostage and give it as a gift to the country of the Philippines because it's a holiday. And they go, oh, by the way, they like doing this on holidays. And Guillermo Sobero ended up getting his head cut. Because of all the warring factions on our side of the table not telling each other what the hell's going on. So I had assumed at that point in time that people would tell us the stuff we need to know, we didn't need to ask. And after that, I got like, look, there ain't nothing here that I don't need to know. If it's a holiday, it's coming up, and you assume, I know you got to tell us. So, really learned a lot about collaboration on our side of the table and also the lack of collaboration on the other side of the table. Just because we're a mess doesn't mean they got their act together and the bad guys didn't have their act together. And ultimately the hostages, one of the reasons someone didn't come out, because internally, they had double crossed each other. So learned a lot about what really fundamental human nature dynamics are in teams, and your team has not got its act together, and the other team does not either. So what can you do as a communicator to make up for that? Really learned a lot about that in that case. I had cases subsequent to that involving Al-Qaeda when Al-Qaeda was killing people on a regular basis. But we saw those coming and we did everything we could do to keep the train from smashing into us. You see a train coming down the tracks, you know it's coming down the tracks, and you do the best you can to derail it, and sometimes you can't."}
{"question": "What are some strategies for creating a conducive sleep environment during Phase 3 of the 24-hour day, which involves rewiring the brain and consolidating habits formed in Phase 1 and 2?", "doc_id": "Wcs2PFz5q6g_14", "video_id": "Wcs2PFz5q6g", "video_title": "The Science of Making & Breaking Habits", "video_header": "Tool 3: Phase-Based Habit Plan: Phase 3", "segment_idx": "14", "time_start": "55:27", "time_end": "1:01:28", "context": "from about 16 to 24 hours after waking. During that period of time, there are few things that are going to support being in a state of mind, state of body that are going to allow neuroplasticity to occur, that are going to allow the rewiring that you've triggered during the waking part of the day to actually take place. Those things are very low to no light, meaning keeping your environment very dark or very, very dim. I don't think it's necessary to sleep in a room that's complete blackness. I think that's a little bit overkill, but for most people keeping the room dark and keeping the room temperature low is very beneficial for getting and staying in deep sleep. The body has to drop by about 1 to 3 degrees in order to get into sleep and stay asleep, so low light, low temperature environment, you can always pile on blankets of course if you don't want to be cold at night, you want to be warm enough, but you want your environment to be cold. Typically people aren't eating in the middle of the night, although one thing that can be useful is to make sure that you're at least well-fed enough when you head into this third phase of every 24-hour day that you're not awake because you're hungry. A lot of people recommend putting a gap between your final bite of food and when you got to sleep at night. Some people say that gap should be 4 hours, other people say 2 hours, if you're me, I generally have something, I don't know, within 2 hours or 90 minutes of going to sleep, but it's not a big meal, but that's just me, and I fall asleep and stay asleep fine with that. You have to experiment for yourself. I've talked about supplements that can support sleep in previous episode of the podcast, things like magnesium threonate, or magnesium bisglycinate, things like theonine, apigenin. If you'd like to read more about those, we actually have a newsletter that I'll just quickly refer you to this is the Huberman Lab Neural Network Newsletter, you can sign up for it by going to hubermanlab.com, it's very easy to find, but even if you don't sign up, you can go to the toolkit for sleep that's listed there and that tool kit is not just supplements, that tool kit is a number of different things, both behavioral and supplement-based and nutrition-based, et cetera, that can allow you to get in to sleep and to stay asleep more readily. It's totally zero cost, you can find that again at hubermanlab.com. So things like low light, low temperature, the supplements I mentioned, adjusting your eating schedule appropriately, obviously not drinking caffeine in the middle of the night or too close to bed, that's going to be critical. In fact, ideally you wouldn't ingest any caffeine in phase two of the day, so that you could get into this deeper state of rest in which habit formation and neural plasticity can occur. What if you wake up? The way I've cast phase three is that you're supposed to be in this deep slumber, you're not supposed to wake up at all, you're supposed to be in low light and your brain is rewiring and those habits are getting consolidated, et cetera. Well, if you're like me, you probably get up once in the middle of the night. Maybe go use the restroom. Perfectly normal, perfectly normal, but a lot of people have trouble falling back asleep. Very important if you get up in the middle of the night to use a minimum of light in order to navigate your surroundings, just as much as you need in order to safely do so, because light inhibits hormone melatonin, can make it very hard to fall back to sleep if you inhibit melatonin. The effects of light inhibiting melatonin are actually very potent. It happens very, very quickly, so try and keep the lights low. And you have trouble falling back asleep, that's when you might also want to use something like a Reverie app, they have a sleep script there that can hopefully help you get back to sleep. Or something like NSDR, you can find NSDR scripts on YouTube. These are zero cost. You can look up one that I particularly like is NSDR Madefor. It's a company I'm associated with, but the NSDR is completely zero cost, and there are other things, like Yoga Nidra, which you can find scripts for elsewhere. Again, all of these habits or these behaviors, these do's and don'ts around phase three, themselves might be habits that you're trying to create for yourself. But again, phase three is really about making sure that whatever limbic friction you've been able to override in phase one and trigger some new habit, right? Forcing yourself to write or forcing yourself to study or forcing yourself to exercise during that high limbic friction state. And then whatever things you've been doing in phase two, which are habits that hopefully have moved a little bit further along the continuum of newly-formed versus all the way to reflexive, or things that take less limbic friction in in order to do. Phase three is when all of that gets really locked into the nervous system through those Hebbian mechanisms, like NMDA receptors, et cetera, that I talked about before. Again, neuroplasticity is the basis of habit formation and neuroplasticity and the rewiring of neural circuits happens in these states of deep sleep. So if you're not obeying this phase three, if you're not giving phase three the material it needs, and you're and you're not avoiding the certain things, like caffeine and bright light and stress during phase 3, you're simply not going to be able to build those habits that you've been working so hard to trigger in phase one and phase two of the day. Again, these are things that I've talked about previous episodes of the podcast and elsewhere, but really this is about habit formation. And the whole reason for placing particular types of behaviors at particular phases of the day is to set a framework for that task-bracketing. Again, task-bracketing and the circuits of the basal ganglia indicate that it's not just the neural circuits that are engaged by the task itself, but the neural circuits that are engaged before and after that task execution. That's what gets consolidated. So when you do things that particular phases of the day, under particular conditions of neurochemistry, what you're doing is you're giving the brain a very predictable set of sequences that during sleep it can start to put into your hard drive, if you will. It can really program it into your nervous system, so that within a short period of time, hopefully within 18 or maybe even 6 days or who knows? Maybe even fewer days, you'll find that executing those behaviors is very, very straightforward for you and that you won't have to feel so much limbic friction or override so much limbic friction."}
{"question": "What are some everyday activities that can bring about a sense of peace, contentment, and delight, and how do they relate to agency and gratitude?", "doc_id": "qPKd99Pa2iU_3", "video_id": "qPKd99Pa2iU", "video_title": "Dr. Paul Conti: How to Improve Your Mental Health | Huberman Lab Guest Series", "video_header": "Agency & Gratitude", "segment_idx": "3", "time_start": "16:25", "time_end": "21:09", "context": "Andrew Huberman: I really appreciate that you highlight that agency and gratitude are verb states from which peace, contentment and delight emerge. And also the way that you explain the generative drive that is distinct from aggressive drives and pleasure drives that exist in all of us. I'm smiling because a number of examples of peace, contentment, and delight while in action come to mind. I mean, for me, podcasting, and in particular, preparing for a podcast, trying to mine the literature and figure out where the gems reside and where the confusion could emerge. And all of that brings about such peace, contentment and delight for me, but it's anything but passive. Likewise, yesterday had the experience of running into a puppy. It's been a while since I've owned a dog, and dogs are delightful. Puppies are particularly delightful. Paul Conti: I had the experience of seeing you light up when you ran into the puppy. Andrew Huberman: You did, and I'm still buzzing from that short interaction with the puppy. Downstairs the way Mariner puppy. I don't know why, but I just delight in animals of most all kinds. Not a fan of reptiles, sorry, reptile fans so much, but I just drive so much energy from it, and it felt like life energy. And the way the animal is sort of attentionally scattered is amusing to me as compared to the dog that he will eventually be, which is going to be more linear in his thinking. It encapsulates so much of the other things I love, like brain development, et cetera. Anyway, I highlight those examples because there's nothing passive about it. It's pure delight and joy for me, and it intersects with other delights and joys. And I think that as you describe agency and gratitude, peace, contentment and delight in these generative forces as well as other forces that exist in us, I think it's really critical that people understand that these are not states that you sit down and place yourself into, although perhaps one could through reflection or meditation or waking up from a really great night's sleep, things of that sort, but that these are things that we can find ourselves awash in if we are doing the right things. And those things can oftentimes be very challenging. So assuming I understand the way the model is spelled out correctly, I'm more and more delighted at the fact that this is not just accessible in one domain, but is accessible in many, many different domains for everybody. This is not something unique to my experience, even though I give examples from my own life, but that we really all do have access to this if we're looking in those cupboards, those ten cupboards, and asking the right questions and. Paul Conti: To maybe comment even a little further on the experience of you and the dog. So it was an experience of delight. And you enjoyed it, and it brought a sense of peace and contentment, like, all of that happens. But think about what that's linked to. I believe there's a strong sense of agency in you that you are enacting. There's a strong gratitude in you that you're enacting. You're handling your life in a way. And also for all of us, good things always come with good fortune, but it comes with our strivings and our achievements that you're in a place to delight in that. If you are unhappy, like, I don't like what I'm doing, I'm angry, I'm frustrated, then there's no room in you to find the delight. And the delight that you find is also very much linked to the generative drive. It makes me think of how you loved and nurtured Costello. So you have it in you to love and nurture a dog, and you have done that in a really wonderful way. And that generative drive is part and parcel of the delight you feel when you see a dog, because you love dogs and you think about nurturing, and it all comes together. The agency and the gratitude expressed as verbs puts you in a position to have that sense of delight which is so intertwined with your generative drive, with a sense of caretaking, a sense of creating the beyond self. Because although you enjoyed and loved Casello, you enjoyed and loved his happiness, right? So it all comes together. And I think it's interesting because in some ways it's a simple example, but that's life. Life has its big moments, but so much of our lives are the smaller moments that link together. And I think that smaller moment becomes a big example. Andrew Huberman: I appreciate that you mentioned Costello. For listeners of this podcast that have tuned into early episodes, Costello was the source of the background snoring. For those of you that haven't, you can go check. He was a 90 pound English bulldog mastiff who had many skills, the best of which was snoring. So in addition to the generative drive, which is something that we"}
{"question": "What are the numbers 3, 5, and 8 to 10, and how do they relate to my carbon dioxide tolerance rate?", "doc_id": "x4m_PdFbu-s_12", "video_id": "x4m_PdFbu-s", "video_title": "How to Breathe Correctly for Optimal Health, Mood, Learning & Performance | Huberman Lab Podcast", "video_header": "Tool: Train Healthy Breathing, Carbon Dioxide Tolerance Test & Box Breathing", "segment_idx": "12", "time_start": "1:09:47", "time_end": "1:22:38", "context": "And, again, when I say healthy or unhealthy, I mean, are you overbreathing? Are you underbreathing? Are you delivering the appropriate ratios of oxygen and carbon dioxide to the tissues of your brain and body? In order to do this, we're going to do a simple test. Again, please don't do this while driving or operating heavy machinery or near water of any kind. But assuming that you're not doing any of those things, I encourage you to sit down, certainly not lie down but just sit down. I suppose you also could do it standing. And we are going to do what's called the carbon dioxide tolerance test. The carbon dioxide tolerance test is a sort of back of the envelope measure of how well you are managing carbon dioxide, that is, how well you can control your breathing at both the mechanical and the chemical level. It's a very simple test. What you're going to do is for the next 10 seconds or so while I'm speaking, you're just going to breathe normally. Now, again and again throughout this episode, I'm going to encourage you to be a nasal breather whenever possible. But of course, there are instances in which you want to engage mouth breathing. But for the time being, as I continue to blab on for the next few seconds, just inhale through your nose, exhale through your nose. You don't have to deliberately slow your breathing or increase the cadence of your breathing. However, in that time, you're also going to want to find some sort of time measuring device, like could be your phone or it could be a stopwatch. What I'm going to ask you to do in a few minutes is I'm going to ask you to inhale through your nose as deeply as you possibly can. That is, you're going to fill your lungs as much as you can through your nose. And then start a timer and measure how long it takes for you to deliberately control that exhale until your lungs are empty. So this is going to be a controlled exhale through the nose after a big deep breath. But for the time being, keep breathing at a kind of calm, regular cadence. So you can find that time measuring device now, or you can come back to it later if you like. When I say inhale, you're going to inhale as deeply as you can through your nose, remembering that the diaphragm can really help you here to get a deep inhale by having your belly move out while you inhale. And then when I say start, you're going to measure the time that it takes to do a complete lungs empty exhale. In fact, I'll measure it for you. This will be one of the rare instances in this podcast where there's going to be a long period of silence as I measure something. So I've got a stopwatch here. So please prepare to do the big inhale and start inhaling now. So inhale as deeply as you can through your nose. Fill your lungs as much as you can. OK? Now start, meaning slowly control the exhale through your nose. You're trying to let that air out as slowly as possible. And I'm just going to call out every 10 or 15 seconds or so. And you want to note when your lungs are empty. I know you can hold your breath with your lungs empty. That is not an accurate measure. 15 seconds. It is important that when note your lungs are empty and that you're trying to control the exhale as much as possible so that you don't arrive at that lungs empty time too quickly. I'll explain what too quickly means. 30 seconds. OK, for those of you that have already reached lungs empty, please go back to breathing normally. For those of you that haven't, you can hang in here a little longer if you're still discarding that air. 45 seconds. And we're rounding toward a minute, not quite there. Some of you are probably still letting out that air. I want to point out none of this has to do with cardiovascular fitness level, at least not in any kind of direct way. And 60 seconds. And I realize there will be a small subset of you out there that are still expelling your air in a slow lungs-- slow exhale manner through the nose. OK, so what we just did is a back of the envelope carbon dioxide discard rate if you need to pause this and go back and try it again you just want to time how long it takes you to go from lungs full to lungs empty, again, with the full understanding I know that you can all sit there like beasts and hold your breath with your lungs empty. But please don't do that because that's not going has been informative for what I'm telling you now. What I'm going to tell you now is that if it took you 20 seconds or less to expel all your air, that is, you couldn't extend that exhale longer than 20 seconds, in a kind of back of the envelope way, we can say that have a relatively brief or low carbon dioxide tolerance. If it took you somewhere between 25 and 40, maybe 45 seconds to expel all your air, that is, you could control that exhale for about 45 seconds or 30 seconds, then you have a moderate level of carbon dioxide tolerance. And if, for instance, you were able to go 50 seconds or longer for that discard until you hit lungs empty, you have a fairly high degree of carbon dioxide tolerance. Now, here's the deal. If you had low carbon dioxide tolerance, that is, you're 20 seconds or less, you're going to write down the number three. If you had moderate levels of carbon dioxide tolerance, you're going to write down the number five. or you could even put five to six. And then if you are in that bracket of people that was able to discard your air over a period of 50 seconds or more, you're going to write down the number 8 to 10. OK? Now, what are these numbers? What are we talking about? And before we get into what to do with these numbers, I want to emphasize again, this does not have to do with fitness level per se. I know some world class triathletes that have very fast carbon dioxide blow-off times. That is, their discard rates are 20 seconds or less. I should also point out that if you're very stressed, that number is going to be very small. If you're very relaxed, like you just woke up after a long night of sleep and you feel great, that number is going to be extended. So this is a back of the envelope measure that you're going to use each time you decide to do the exercise I'm going to tell you about in a moment. And the exercise I'm going to tell you about in a moment can be done every day if you like. But what the most interesting studies, at least to me, indicate is that you could do the exercise I'll tell you about even just once or twice a week and greatly improve your efficiency of breathing and shift yourself away from overbreathing when at rest, even if you're not thinking about how you're breathing at rest. So what is this exercise? Well, you just got your number, either low, medium, or high bracket number for carbon dioxide discard rate. Remember, if you're in the low category, your number is three. If you're medium, it's five to six. And if you are in the long carbon dioxide discard rate, long duration carbon dioxide discard rate, that is, 8 to 10 is your number. Now you're going to do two minutes of what most people would call box breathing. What is box breathing? Box breathing are equal duration inhale, hold, exhale, hold, repeat. So inhale, hold, exhale, hold. Sounds very easy, right? How long do you inhale and then hold, exhale and then hold? Well, you now know. If you are in the low group of carbon dioxide discard rate, your inhale is going to be three seconds, your hold will be three seconds, your exhale will be three seconds, and then you repeat, three seconds. So each side of the box, if you will, is going to be three seconds long. If you were in the moderate carbon dioxide discard rate category, then you're going to inhale for five to six seconds, hold for five to six, exhale for five to six, hold for five to six, repeat for about two minutes. You could do three minutes if you want. But I think it's important to have protocols that are feasible for most people. And that's going to mean doing things for about two to five minutes when it comes to these breath rehabilitation exercises for restoring normal breathing. And then, of course, if you are in the long category of carbon dioxide discard rate, you should be able to do an 8 to 10 second inhale, 8 to 10 second hold, 8 to 10 second exhale, 8 to 10 second hold, and repeat. So you could do that exercise now if you like, or you could do it at some point offline. You can pause this podcast if you want and go try it. That's an exercise that you can do for about two to three minutes once or twice per week. What's happening when you do that exercise? Well, first of all, you are greatly increasing your neuromechanical control over the diaphragm. This is very important. Most people are not aware of this phrenic nerve pathway in the diaphragm. And you are greatly increasing your mechanical control over this pathway through the process we call neuroplasticity. When you deliberately focus on a aspect of your nervous system control and particular nervous system control over musculature that normally is subconscious and you're not paying attention to and when you actively take control of that, it requires that your brain adjust and rewire the relationship between the different components of that circuit. And the wonderful thing is that has been shown to lead to changes in your resting pattern of breathing. Now, why did we go through the whole business of doing the carbon dioxide tolerance test? Well, for people who don't tolerate carbon dioxide very well, they don't have very good phrenic, that is, neuromechanical control of the diaphragm, for whatever reason-- again, it doesn't mean you're not fit. It just means you don't have or you have not yet developed neuromechanical control of the diaphragm. It would be near impossible for you to do box breathing for two or three minutes with eight seconds in, eight seconds hold, eight seconds exhale, eight second hold. So that's why we do a test to see what you're capable of doing. You don't want the box breathing to be too strained where you're [GRUNTS],, where you're really challenged to get around the whole box. You want it to be relatively easy because, remember, you're trying to translate this pattern to your normal pattern of breathing, that is, your pattern of breathing when you're not consciously thinking about breathing. And what are we really translating when we do this box breathing type exercise? What you're translating is the ability to pause between breaths and yet take full mechanically-driven breaths that involve the phrenic nerve and diaphragm. So, again, you're encouraging, especially if you use nasal breathing when you do the box breathing-- you're encouraging phrenic control over the diaphragm. And you're getting that six liters of air per minute or so using fewer and fewer breaths over time. So this is a, again, zero cost-- although it does cost a little bit of time-- zero cost approach to adjusting your normal pattern of breathing at rest, which has a huge number of positive outcomes in terms of your ability to stay relatively calm, to not get the hyperexcitability of the brain. It has actually been shown in various studies-- and we'll talk about one in particular later-- to greatly improve not just levels of calm and reduce bouts of stress but also improve nighttime sleep. There are huge number of benefits that can come from doing this box breathing exercise. But you got to get the duration of the size of the box right, and that's why you do the carbon dioxide tolerance test. One thing that many people notice after doing the carbon dioxide tolerance test even just once and then doing this box breathing exercise once or twice a week is that after two or three weeks, the box breathing itself becomes very easy. And in that case, I recommend taking the carbon dioxide tolerance test over again. And almost always what you'll find is that you have been able to extend your carbon dioxide discard rate, and therefore, you now fall into a different category, not just the lower medium but the long carbon dioxide discard rate category, and you are able to extend the duration of those inhale, hold, exhale, holds during the box breathing. And, of course, the ultimate benefit of all this is that it translates to deeper and yet less frequent breathing when at rest and when not consciously paying attention to how you're breathing during the daytime. Again, if at all possible, do all of this breathing through the nose. For those of you that have a severely occluded nose, the recommendation always is to breathe through your nose more. But I do realize that for some people, it's really uncomfortable to breathe through the nose because they have such an occluded nasal pathway. And for you folks, doing some of this breathing through the mouth can probably suffice. But if at all possible, do the breathing through the nose. And please also let me know how your progress evolves over time with the carbon dioxide discard rate and the box breathing. And of course, the positive shifts that occur in normal unconscious daytime breathing translate to all the opposite things that we talked about when you are overbreathing during the daytime. So what I just described in terms of the carbon dioxide tolerance test and the exercise using box breathing to restore normal patterns of breathing and not overbreathe and therefore not eliminate too much carbon dioxide is exactly the two tests that were incorporated into a study"}

So growth hormone is released, goes to the liver, and then the liver releases something called IGF-1, insulin growth factor 1. Insulin growth factor 1 was popular in the neuroscience community as an area of focus because of its ability to trigger improvements in memory and learning after exercise. And indeed exercise triggers both the release of growth hormone and IGF-1. IGF-1 seems responsible for a lot of the effects of improved memory. Some people report that that is due to increased number of neurons or neurogenesis, birth of new neurons. It's pretty clear that in humans, that's not what's happening. Yes in animals, not in humans. IGF-1 nonetheless has positive effects on memory and cognition. And a great way to trigger IGF-1 release and growth hormone release is through exercise. Now, the interesting thing, and the reason I'm bringing up IGF-1 here is that certain patterns of exercise, actually duration of exercise have different effects on IGF-1 and growth hormone, depending on whether or not the exercise is done by men or women. There's what we call sex-dependent effect. And the sex-dependent effect is as follows. In this particular study and several others, what they did is they had people exercise. They measured growth hormone and IGF-1 levels from the blood before, during and after exercise. And they could see when the greatest increases occurred. This was standard sorts of resistance exercise. So some squats. There was a sprint like activity. It doesn't really matter what the specific exercises were. None of them were to failure. These were in kind of the 10 repetition or less range, six sets. So kind of standard weight training stuff that anyone might do. But what was interesting is that women were able to access the biggest peak in growth hormone and IGF-1 early in the exercise. So in the first 30 minutes. So what this means is even if you just have 30 minutes, at least for women, there's going to be a big increase in growth hormone and IGF-1 in the first 30 minutes. For men, the biggest increase occurred later in the exercise, which was at 60 minutes or so total. And so the sex-dependent effects are interesting. They point to the fact that things like cortisol, testosterone, and estrogen, which of course vary in different levels in men and women are going to impact the release of things like IGF-1 and growth hormone. And yes, they did control for all sorts of things like diet and they controlled for weight and prior experience. It's actually a quite nice study. If you'd like to check it out, it's by a Pierce et al, \"Growth Hormone and Insulin Growth Factor-I Molecular Weight Isoform Response to Resistance Exercise Are Sex-Dependent\" in Frontiers in Endocrinology, fine journal in 2020. So it's quite recent. So what does this mean? This means if you're exercising and you want growth hormone release, warm up, do the type of exercise that we've been discussing. Women, in the first 30 minutes, is when you're going to get the maximum benefit in terms of growth hormone and IGF-1. Men, you have to keep going for the entire 60 minutes. So don't tap out early if you're interested in getting the growth hormone and IGF-1 release. And the same conditions apply about then cooling down and not making the exercise last so long that you don't get the increase in growth hormone the following night. My experience thus far in doing this podcast is that people fall into one of two categories."}
{"question": "Can stress and a positive mindset actually influence the growth of tumors, and if so, how does the dopamine system play a role in this process?", "doc_id": "poOf8b2WE2g_19", "video_id": "poOf8b2WE2g", "video_title": "Using Your Nervous System to Enhance Your Immune System", "video_header": "Brain Chemicals & Cyclic-Hyperventilation; Catecholamines, Dopamine", "segment_idx": "19", "time_start": "1:29:11", "time_end": "1:32:06", "context": "that I want to emphasize. And that was that they actually measured the so-called catecholamine concentrations. Catecholamines are things like dopamine, epinephrin, norepinephrine. These are chemicals in your nervous system and body that promote states of alertness, dopamine, of course, part of the reward and motivation pathways. They explored the levels of these molecules in blood, in plasma during and after this breathing protocol. And it was interesting, as I mentioned before, epinephrin showed robust increases compared to the control group, norepinephrine, significant increases occurred in the breathing group, in the cyclic hyperventilation retention breathing group, of course, but less so. And dopamine levels actually dropped somewhat. But this is very interesting because there's a new and emerging literature largely from Asya, A-Y-S-A Rolls' lab in Israel. What her laboratory has shown is that motivational state and mindset has a powerful impact on various aspects of the immune system that were thought to be independent of the brain and mind and thinking. So this brings us back to something that we discussed at the very beginning of this episode, which is that 20, 30 years ago, the idea that you could heal the body with the mind was considered kind of quackery. I think that there was an intervening period up until now where people might've said, \"sure, if you're stressed out, it's going to make things worse.\" I mean, I think everyone agrees that stress makes every thing worse at some level, outcomes to neurodegeneration, performance in a physical endeavors and mental endeavors. If stress is too high for too long people experience different challenges and essentially every major psychiatric disorder, everything suffers, but in the short term, stress can actually be beneficial in the ways that we just described. And stress, if we break it down is really a neurochemical state, right? It's the release of these catacholamines. And what Asya Rolls' laboratory has shown is that when the so-called dopamine system and at several episodes, I described there are multiple dopamine systems, but the so-called mesolimbic reward pathway involving areas like the nucleus accumbens, et cetera. When the reward system that's associated with dopamine and norepinephrine is activated, you see incredible effects, including for instance, highly significant reduction in tumor size in cancers. Now, why would that be? How is it that mindset, dopamine and tumors, and tumor growth are somehow linked? We now know how this occurs largely through the incredible work of Asya Rolls and others. So, now I'd like to turn our focus to how it is specifically"}

{"question": "Does feeling a strong desire for social interaction or food have a common underlying biological mechanism?", "doc_id": "RgAcOqVRfYA_12", "video_id": "RgAcOqVRfYA", "video_title": "Science of Social Bonding in Family, Friendship & Romantic Love", "video_header": "Socializing & Food Appetite: Crossover Craving", "segment_idx": "12", "time_start": "38:05", "time_end": "42:38", "context": "Now I've been drawing a lot of parallels between this social seeking or avoiding social isolation and hunger, but is that really the case? And could it be that they're actually interactions between the different drives? Meaning could social isolation or the desire to seek out social interactions actually relate to the hunger system and vice versa? And indeed the answer is yes. We don't have 50 different homeostatic systems and 50 different neurochemicals to underlie our drive, to eat our drive for romantic interactions, our drive for friendship interactions, we have essentially one, maybe two, and they all funnel into the same dopamine system. And there's a beautiful paper that illustrates some of the crossover between these different homeostatic drives. The title of the paper is Acute Social Isolation Evokes Midbrain Craving Responses Similar to Hunger. This from Rebecca Saxe's lab at MIT, Massachusetts Institute of technology, Dr. Kay Tye is also an author on this paper, the paper was published in Nature Neuroscience. It's a really terrific paper. Just to briefly summarize what they did, they took people that were categorized as socially connected healthy human adults. So these are people that are used to pretty frequent social interactions, and they socially isolated them for about 10 hours. And they had no opportunity to access social media, email, fiction reading even, and certainly didn't have the opportunity to interact with people face to face. So what this did is it increased social craving, both subjectively the people said that they were now craving social interactions, and then they did brain imaging in response to images of people, people interacting, food, flowers, other types of stimuli, some of the stimuli or these images that we call them stimuli but their images really, had a lot of social engagement going on in them, others did not, some had a lot of faces showing, others did not. And as you might suspect, there was activation of many of the brain areas that we've talked about earlier, dorsal raphe nucleus and other brain areas associated with dopaminergic neurons. When the socially isolated people viewed social cues, people interacting, faces, and so on and less so for things like flowers, however, they also had increased responses to images of food, which is interesting and actually is consistent with the literature that when people are socially isolated, they often will start eating more, or they will change the nature of the foods that they eat. Now we think of that as comfort foods or soothing oneself through eating rather than social interaction as a kind of pathology, but while it might not be healthy, depending on the context and the person, it's really important to understand that the reason that happens is because we have a common circuit and that the system meaning the person is actually craving dopamine release. They don't consciously know this, this is all subconsciously carried out, but they're craving dopamine release. And if they can't get it from social interactions, as they normally would, they'll start seeking it from food. Now they did an important reverse experiment as well, where they had subjects go on 10 hours of food fasting. Now these were not people that were familiar with fasting, they weren't doing intermittent fasting, they were eating more typical meal schedules, and so that created increased hunger, et cetera, but it also increased their appetite if you will, for social interactions. And so the important point here is that there's a common biology, there's a common circuitry that underlies homeostatic craving of things that maintain us as individuals and as a species. And it really places social interactions as right up there in the list of things that we could consider so vital for our survival and for our health. Things like food, water, social interactions really sit within a top tier amongst each other, and they use the same common circuitry, dorsal raphe dopamine neurons, in addition to other structures, in order to create this drive, to seek out certain types of stimuli. Now, this is a very reductionist view of social bonding, I realized that, but it's important to realize that while we place all the subjective context, oh, I miss this person, or I really would like to avoid that person, at the end of the day, it really all funnels into a system whereby a single neurochemical is either being released and motivating us to seek out more of a particular type of interaction or is not released, and therefore we are perfectly comfortable staying exactly where we are."}

control their anxiety yes because it it gives them a sense of control right and and they have control over this and some people may choose to leave them in the fridge and some people may choose to put them elsewhere but is what they decide is that decision they're making that gives them uh a sense of control that's important it's so interesting the sense of agency and control over the um non-negotiable stress response you know I sometimes unfortunately get um in my opinion uh incorrectly attached to ice baths uh we've talked about cold water exposure on this podcast our colleague Craig heler at Stanford Department of biology phenomenal scientist was on this podcast we talked about some of the beneficial uses of deliberate cold exposure there are a lot of arguments does it increase metabolism doesn't seem like it does very much is it useful for inflammation perhaps um but the one thing that everyone agrees is that being in uncomfortably cold water makes you breathe F faster excuse me and stress a bit in other words it kind of sucks it's uncomfortable and I think one non-negotiable fact about deliberate cold exposure is that it gives people an opportunity to explore their own stress response if they're going to do it safely right you take a cold shower you have some control you can get out immediately obviously you don't want it so cold that you give yourself cardiac arrest you know you have to be care care f with deliberate cold exposure but the adrenaline response to uncomfortable cold is non-negotiable and I believe that whether or not somebody decides to you know recite the alphabet or think about how cold it is or whatever it is what they're doing is they are practicing this frontal control over the lyic pathways it's just sort of a general exercise for controlling the lyic system through thought but as our colleague David Spiegel has said to me many times says um you know it's not just the state that you're in here we're talking about stress as the state it's how you got there and in particular did you have any control over how you got there and whether or not you can get out and I think that the kind of stress that you're talking about in post-traumatic stress disorder or in post-traumatic stress injury is typically of the sort that people didn't have a choice certainly these kids didn't have a choice about the initial exposure to the trauma or stress but that also the stress is showing up when they would least want it to appear or when it's very inconvenient to appear so this this narrative is important is an important part of of recovery um but we feel that it needs to come after the education piece and after learning uh a toolbox having defenses because sometimes it can get very charged when you go through the narrative and you want to assess many things during the narrative you want to assess gaps of memory you want to assess potential cues you want to assess the emotions that are present so and and the narrative should be one that covers not only negative events but also neutral ones and also positive events and and it sounds like a lot right but when you're talking about kids that have 10 11 12 years it is doable you know you can really manage it by the way with the cold showers I I think you're getting to the hinge of that seao I I think the cold shower probably does not the cold shower what do you call deliberate cold it could be from cold shower I always say that because oftentimes people think oh you know they're just trying to sell cold plunges and the truth is you don't need that I mean the fact of the matter is uh it's uh independent of income actually a cold shower will save you money on your heating bill I'm not saying everyone should take a cold shower I I love a nice warm or hot shower I sometimes use the cold shower as a stimulus and I hate it every time but I always learn something each time um by the way it feels great when you get out so that's nice and it does for many hours um especially if you end it with some warm water but the uh the learning I believe is in recognizing just how destabilized our patterns of thinking get when we have adrenaline in our body which is what uncomfortable cold does and it deploys that adrenaline in the brain and body and it also is a great learning in seeing the return to a BAS line just seeing how that affects our psychology and I I to my mind I can think of no other zero cost or even negative cost um meaning saves money approach that works the first time and every time you know that is safe enough right I mean I'm not interested in anything that has to do with snakes for instance I don't mind spiders I'll pick them up with my hands as long as it's not a black widow or a particularly large spider and I'll put it outside but I don't like snakes I don't like thinking about them I don't like being near them so you know there are other stressors that one could use but it's so individual whereas cold water seems to be uh pretty uncomfortable for everybody I think you need some exposure of snakes and you're cold no interest it's so interesting you know these things get so firmly rooted but I'd love to talk about this toolbox um because first of all it's according"}

I don't want to get into diagnosing hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. It's just impossible 'cause you're there and I'm here and we're kind of shouting back and forth through a tunnel of video and comments. If you're concerned about having excessively high or excessively low levels of thyroid hormone, absolutely look up what the symptoms are. Talk to your physician. And there are a number of good treatments. I didn't talk about prescription drugs that can improve symptoms related to hypo or hyperthyroid. Of course, they have synthesized thyroid. So if you don't make enough thyroid, you can take thyroid, it's by prescription. If you have too much thyroid, sometimes they'll take out the thyroid gland or they can administer drugs that will either block receptors or will interfere with some of the pathways from the brain to the pituitary or from the pituitary to the thyroid in order to adjust the thyroid hormone that way. So there are the big guns in terms of the treatments for different thyroid disorders but we're not talking about thyroid disorders, we're talking about how to get and maintain thyroid levels in healthy ranges and some straightforward ways to do that through diet and supplementation. There's also a lot of evidence that for people who menstruate, levels of thyroid hormone can fluctuate dramatically"}

So the simple way to think about this is you want as much light as is safely possible early in the day, morning and throughout the day, including blue light, so take those blue blockers off during the day unless you have a real issue with screen light sensitivity, and you want as little light coming into your eyes, artificial or sunlight, after, say, 8:00 p.m., and certainly, you do not want to get bright light exposure to your eyes between 11:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m., and here's why, David Berson, who I mentioned before, and another and friend and colleague, Samer Hattar, who's director of the chronobiology unit at the National Institutes of Mental Health published a paper in \"Cell,\" which is a journal, another excellent journal, very high stringency, showing that light that arrives to the eyes between 11:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m., approximately, suppresses the release of dopamine, this neuromodulator that makes us feel good, and it's sort of an endogenous antidepressant, and can inhibit learning and create all sorts of other detrimental effects, it does this through a mechanism, for those of you that wanna know the neural pathways, that involves light to the eyes that's then signaled to a structure called the habenula, the habenula looks like two little bat ears sitting right in the middle of a structure in your brain called the thalamus, don't worry about these names if you're not interested in this stuff, if you are, these are just avenues to explore, when that habenula gets activated it's actually called the disappointment nucleus because it actually makes us feel less happy and more disappointed, and can lead to certain forms of depression in the wakeful state. Now, if you wake up in the middle of the night and you need to use the bathroom or you're on an all-night flight and you're, you know, need to read or whatever it is, fine, every once in a while, it's not gonna be a problem to get bright light exposure to your eyes in the middle of the night, but if you think about our lifestyle nowadays and being up late looking at phones, even if you dim that screen, you're triggering this activation because your retinal sensitivity and the sensitivity of these neurons has gone up late in the day. Now, I'm not here to dictate what you should or shouldn't do, but for those of you that are experiencing challenges with mood, those of you that have anxiety, learning problems, issues focusing, the questions I usually get are, \"How can I focus better?\" Well, we will get to that, but one of the best ways you can support your mechanisms for good mood, mental health, learning, focus, metabolism, et cetera, is to take control of this light exposure behavior at night and not get much or any bright light exposure in the middle of the night. Red light won't trigger this pathway, but very few people have the kind of infrared lights that are set up, or floor lights, and that brings me to an important point, which is about the location of light, this hasn't been discussed much out there, I don't think, these cells in our eye,"}

And if you have the it's unfortunate, there are so many people that are out on the street these days who have schizophrenia, some of whom are taking their meds, some of who, whom aren't if you ever see somebody on the street that's doing what's it's like a lip smacking and writhing it's actually called tardive dyskinesia. This is a movement disorder that's created by taking these anti dopaminergic drugs. So you can imagine these anti-doping synergic drugs while being very effective in suppressing hallucinations they create these movement problems because of dopamines importance for the movement circuitry so-called pyramidal circuitry for the aficionados. In addition, you sometimes see in males that take these drugs, drugs like haloperidol and the other dopamine blockers that they actually develop breast tissue gynecomastia. So the development of male breast tissue is because of the elevated levels of prolactin because they're suppressing their dopamine so much. Now that's a really extreme case, but maybe perhaps if you see somebody engaging these very strange kind of face riding and body riding behaviors that's actually not a consequence of their mental illness. That's a consequence most often of the drugs that they're taking to treat the mental illness. Those are side effects of those drugs. Now prolactin is increased any time.

you know I'm not intrinsically attached to money I mean I certainly have needs in in life but but I don't enjoy spending money for the sake of spending it or for gaining more possessions but I know people that do and I certainly don't judge um are they somehow existing in a um in a diminished landscape of happiness or or because they seem pretty happy to me uh but they seem to have also worked out this relationship they do certain things to get the extrinsic rewards and they really enjoy what they can do with those extrinsic rewards there's a so there's a huge body of evidence on what are the effects of extrinsic rewards on motivation and performance and I think the latest conclusions if you look at the the latest met analyses so you know huge study of studies trying to accumulate like what's the average effect of adding a financial incentive to a task that wasn't incentivized before or to a job where you know you were paid salary and now we're going to give incentive compensation um there is a boost so in general um people are are more productive when they're incentivized for their output but um these incentives are better for uh for motivating quantity than quality so you see people get more done but they're not necessarily more careful or more thorough are they less careful and less thorough no um actually they there's still positive effects on average they're just weaker um and of course you could then start to say well how do I incentivize you know being fast and careful um but I think where where we do have to be really cautious is um there's an undermining effect of extrinsic rewards on intrinsic motivation and you were you were alluding to this earlier dating back to the early 70s where we know that if we take an interesting task and then we pay you for it you might conclude that you're only doing it for the outcome and you lose interest in the task so the the classic demonstration Mark leer and colleagues is kids playing video games and they're um they're playing them because they're fun and then you start to add in an incentive and then when the incentive is taken away they don't want to play anymore because the meaning of the task has changed and now I'm doing it because I want to get something out of it as opposed to I love the process I think that that um that phenomenon um does not have to exist so we know for example at work um if managers uh as long as they give people autonomy um they don't present the rewards in a controlling way um so instead of saying you know Andrew in order to earn this you need to do the following work uh if they say hey look you know I'd really love it if you you know if you would deliver the following um and in order to make that worth your while I'm offering this incentive people react very differently when they have a sense of choice and control um so I think that that's I guess the starting point in the presence of autonomy I don't I don't think there's a major downside of of extrinsic rewards I think you also have to be careful that um yeah I guess that you're not over justifying the task in other words you're not um you're you're not swamping people's intrinsic reason for doing it but you're adding a reason to try it so actually um if we if we go to a different domain for a second so um look at kids who don't want to eat their vegetables externs incentives are very effective to get kids to try vegetables for the first time but then the hope is that they discover a vegetable or two that they don't mind and then they find reasons to keep doing it um and I think that that's how I want a lot of rewards to work I don't think that rewards should be carrots that we dangle to try to control people's behavior I think they should be symbols of how much we appreciate and value a particular behavior and if you frame them that way it's a lot easier for people to say yeah you know what I'm that that reward is something that I really want but I'm I'm not only doing the task for that reward yeah that that you basically answered the question I was going to ask which is and you know at risk of sounding new Agy um but we are sitting in California um I could imagine that when one is focused on the extrinsic rewards so a physical task or a cognitive task for an extrinsic reward if I'm focusing on the exic reward I'm also air quotes again not present right I'm I'm thinking about the outcome I'm not thinking about process and I think there's perhaps you can flesh out some of what this is exactly but I think there's a fairly extensive um data to support the idea that when we are physically and mentally present to the task that we're going to perform better and presumably our our um intrinsic liking of that task or performing that task increases as well is that true yeah I think so I think so if we want to break down the mechanisms for why intrinsic motivation is useful for for performance um one you touched on earlier it's focus of attention um you're it's much easier to find flow when you're intrinsically motivated you get into that state of deep absorption where uh time melts away so you mentioned you know sort of either speeding up or slowing down your your sense of time you forget where you are sometimes you even lose track of your identity and you're just you're just merged into the task uh and so that that that concentration is helpful there's also a greater persistence effect that when you enjoy what you're doing you're less likely to give up in the face of obstacles uh you're more likely to think about it when you're not doing the task and come up with great ideas and so um you know I think there's there's a working harder there's a working longer there's a working smarter and there's also a thinking more clearly effect this is a uh brief but related tangent one of the things that I've found incredibly difficult in recent years is that um you know most of my life really since I was a small kid I was forging for things and then you know I used to give lectures on Monday in class if they let me until they eventually stopped me about the stuff I was reading about all weekend so got an early start in the the professorial um front but now if I'm reading something and I discover a what I think is a really valuable piece of information or a tool or a protocol I'm like wow this is really cool these findings are oh so cool there's a problem which is that now I have an opportunity to cast that out to the world through social media we all do this could be sorry you're on social media um from time to time I do you're all over my feet uh you and and I both do our own social media by the way which I really appreciate I think one can always detect if if someone else is handling someone's Social Media so yes I'm on soci media and and I love that I have the opportunity to both um send out ideas and information and also receive feedback I really love the comment section um and always encourage comments I I learn from it uh frankly love is a strong word I learn from it you know and and you and I were weaned in the academic culture where frankly the the kind of hazing that that one receives in academic culture is very different than the kind of hazing that one receives on social media but um let's just say that if you come up through Academia you develop a pretty thick skin um I agree I I do have to say though that there there was a part of me that was really surprised when I started posting on social that I love I love constructive criticism I was unprepared for the number of people who will knee-jerk criticize a study without even looking at whether the methods are rigorous right I'm like come on if I posted this surely it's at least worth considering the possibility that there's strong evidence behind it right well that's where a uh a um a brief uh I want to call it a r but a response of you know um you know uh clearly you should read the study further because I think you'll be satisfied with the answer or something I don't know um but I agree it it can be a little bit harsh in there sometimes but you know the social media uh channels are I think have you know they have it's a double-edged blade um they obviously have their issues but um can be a wonderful opportunity to share information and share it quickly the problem is that it takes me out of what I was doing initially which was learning searching for those gems with with which to share later and I think there's a broader landscape to consider this where people for instance are uh I was at the beach yesterday it was just absolutely spectacular day at the beach uh especially for this time of year and everyone was taking pictures of that experience on their phone and probably sharing that experience either social media or with friends um this is very different than taking a photograph and not seeing that photograph until later or not sending it out and so there are now near infinite number of circumstances where we are taken out of the rewarding experience I should rephrase that we are taking ourselves out of the rewarding experience and focusing on a different rewarding experience that I think by definition is an extrinsic reward so we are taking ourselves out of our intrinsically rewarding experiences and activating these extrinsic rewards and do you think in any way that's undermining our experience of things that we really enjoy um again not to demonize social media or these channels but um I've personally found it difficult to refrain from sharing this knowledge I'm so excited to share but I deliberately delay and there's a lot I have a deep list of folders full of things that I want to post but I'm just doing it you know systematically over time because I really fight the temptation to to do this mostly because I want to continue to enjoy this learning process and this seeking process so much yeah I I feel the same the same um I feel torn I think"}

and four as well but they're in reference to um to other things um learning memory creativity the role of naps Etc and I'll refer people back to this um beautiful formula uh q qrt that it's not just about getting enough sleep it's about the quantity indeed but also the quality QQ regularity and timing of sleep and knowing one's chronotype that is the best time to go to bed and the best time to wake up in the morning for them is going to be critical here and and I can raise my hand I'll raise both hands in fact uh metaphorically and say that when I've gone to sleep early and woken up early so for me 8:30 9 p.m. and then waking up at 4:35 a.m. which for me matches my chronotype uh it has served as a powerful anti-depressant effect and when I've gotten an equal amount of sleep but going to bed too late for me that is you know midnight 1 a.m. and sleeping in until 8: or 9:00 a.m. um I always carry a low-level depression um fortunately not something that needed to be uh medicated but uh it's it's a striking effect in the positive direction when obeying qqr and in in the negative Direction when not so maybe just for because we can provide some links to um those segments in the show note captions but maybe just um for people that are here now um if we were going to list out you know two or three things that one can do to try and maximize um the quality and quantity of REM sleep uh without going on too much of a tangent but um at the same time we do want to highlight that addressing that Q qrt formula um for ourselves is going to be critical so maybe so for REM sleep um yeah you know in the domain of exercise temperature Etc are there any kind of quick quick bullet points that we can refer people to I would say just to keep it high level and and brief the single best way cheapest non-pharmacological way that you can enhance your REM sleep is to just sleep an extra 15 or 20 minutes later into the morning don't try to put if I tell you this is about by the way this is about the the quantity the your sleep opportunity don't try to add that 30 minutes or 20 minutes if your goal is to increase real sleep at the start of the night at the front end instead take that desire that I've offered you of adding just 20 minutes or 25 minutes of extra sleep now to the last part of your night wake up that sort of much later 20 25 minutes later that's the REM sleep Rich phase so if people go back and listen to episode one we'll describe to you exactly how the different stages of sleep unfold across the night and they're not evenly distributed it's not as though you get just as much REM sleep as well as deep non-rem sleep in the first half of the night as you do in the second you get most of your deep sleep in the first half and you get most of your REM sleep in the second half and particularly in the last quarter of the night and this leads us to understand that the later into the morning hours that we go the greater the hunger preference and The Taste desire there is of your brain to start sampling from the finger Buffet of all of those different stages this thing called REM sleep and the later that you sleep into the morning the more of that REM sleep that you will have and many people will have experienced this at the weekend where they have this pattern that we don't Rec recommend based on the qqr T um QQ our regularity go to bed at the same time wake up at the same time what we see often in society is something what we call social jetl where you're short sleeping during the week and then at the weekend you're out with friends or you're out sort of on the town you go to bed late and you wake up late and maybe you're doing that by 2 hours maybe you're normally in bed by 10: p.m. during the week but now at the weekends you're going to sleep maybe 12 12:30 and you're waking up 2 3 hours later on a Saturday and Sunday and then the problem with that parenthetically is on Sunday evening you've now got to go back to work the next day so you have to push yourself back to 10:30 or 10:00 whereas you were going to bed let's say at 1 a.m. on Friday and Saturday night that's a 3-hour Time shift and people are doing that very frequently that's the equivalent of you and I flying back and forth from Los Angeles to New York every single weekend in terms of oaan Rhythm and it's brutal on it but this is separate from this notion of your timing the final part of the Q qrt and by pushing your timing a little bit later into the morning when you wake up you will experience more REM sleep and as I said when people sleep later they go to bed later at night and they wake up much later in the morning at the weekend I strongly suspect that if they paid attention they would say at weekends I always dream more I always can remember my dreams and they're more intense it's not because there's something magical about how your memory recollection of Dreams operates on Saturdays and Sundays it's because you've slept in later you've gone into that REM sleep Rich preferential phase in the morning and therefore you've increased your REM sleep so I would say that that's probably the easiest way that you can start to modulate REM sleep so that's a terrific do and um I think we can probably summarize the the top don't as uh don't drink alcohol because it abolishes REM sleep alcohol and THC are both very potent ways that will remove or obliterate your REM sleep and we spoke about this in the episode on um on THC when we discussed this I think just yesterday I got a very long email and you know I'm sure you get lots of emails from um from delightful people in the public and a Gentleman just saying you know I was using cannabis for probably about 7 years and then I watched um or listen to some of your content and I stopped and I just had this explosion of dreams and I was never recollecting any of my dreams before but now they came back and goodness were they Vivid they were Rich they were and I could not believe it and that's REM sleep and that's because during the kind use by way of the THC not the CBD you've been blocking that REM sleep you've built up that pressure just as we described in the dementi these and then when you finally do take away the agent that is blocking the generation of REM sleep the THC all of a sudden your brain doesn't just go back to having its standard amount of REM sleep and dreaming it has that plus it tries to get back as much of it as it possibly can by having what we call a REM sleep rebound and that's why people when they they stop using they end up having this intense real sleep by the way to your point about reward and um addiction sensitivity with sleep deprivation one of the things that we um we did in a collaboration gosh this was years ago when I was at Harvard with Carl Hart who I think you I don't know if you colia yeah Colombia you know him yeah he's fantastic researcher very interesting man too um and what we found was that a lack of sleep was not only predictive of your addiction potential but when you went into a clinic to abstain and trying to come off some of those and here we were looking at cocaine um addiction a lack of sleep was a strong predictor of your abstinence and you falling off the wagon and going back to you so sleep is so critical not just for um maintaining or pushing you away from that addiction potential but once you are addicted and you're trying to abstain it gives you that lift of altitude to try to resist falling off the wagon and when sleep gets short that's when you become vulnerable again probably because your reward circuitry becomes enhanced and all of a sudden you just cannot resist the temptation anymore I want to take a"}

But I only got accepted in one university at the time. And I joined the Learning and Memory Lab. And I liked learning and memory at the beginning, I worked on the snails on Aplysia californica, and started looking at learning and memory. But then the same lab was looking at these daily variation. I was really struck. Like you never think about it outside of science. It's really struck me that organisms can measure day biologically. That was very shocking to me. And I just really got attracted and I wanted to see why does this happen? What is the effect of different times of day? And I just stuck with it. It just, it was mind blowing for me who was in medical school, that I've never heard about it before. You know, it's really amazing medicine, I think still now we are very good at looking at stuff spatially, but we're very bad at looking at temporal aspects. So we always like to see images, static images, spatial information. - Right, take an x-ray, measure a temperature- - Yeah, exactly. - Measure a blood pressure. - But we don't think of temporal. And you talk to John Hogenesch right now, and he's telling you the importance of chronomedicine or chromo pharma... Whatever the word is.

realize this is getting into the details but I'm sure a percentage of our listeners would be curious to do that and of course um milk proteins always make me sleep so uh kind of fits you know it's really interesting I I will say that milk protein casine seems to be slower absorbing and that's because of the impact with the the gut obviously but is there anything special about casine or milk protein the answer to that would actually be no but the the length of time that it takes for digestion absorption maybe where the benefit comes in that being said there's some data to support High saturated fat Dairy believe it or not actually can be good for Health and Longevity I know there's uh people will say high saturated fat or or high fat Dairy would be negative but I would say that there is evidence to support it being Health promoting well nothing like a piece of terrific cheese like a Parmesan or a um or a shot of uh full fat cream and I will mention the which I love every once in a while that's a guilty pleasure a shot of full fat cream with equal part espresso I'll take it I'll take it I will mention that the Lucine content in milk protein is a little bit lower okay or um say Greek yogurt are there any sort of um cryptic Champion proteins you know I I think most of us think okay steak and ground beef and maybe Venison and elk and eggs and all the obvious things chicken fish Etc but are there any kind of um cryptic proteins out there that are particularly good for us in terms of their amino acid content that people don't think of you hear these days about Li I frankly don't like the taste I don't like liver but um liver has a lot of other benefits to it so it's high in fat soluble vitamins and iron very bioavailable but I'm not it's very difficult to eat yeah I think people either love it or hate it um I'm on the second category so no no proteins come to mind is you know is salmon you know quality protein salmon is a quality protein is higher in fat again calorie balance does matter fish is interesting fish has 5 gram of protein per 1 ounce versus me meat has on average seven gram seven or eight red meat has seven or eight grams of protein per 1 ounce so interesting you know that this idea that you know eating muscle can support the health of muscle it makes sense though doesn't it it makes perfect sense and and You' explained very clearly as to why that why that is um okay we set aside liver um for this conversation some people are into cricket and maybe there is sorry I apologize to the well not to the Crickets The Crickets probably thank me for for my response but I'm not judging it's just my my personal visceral response um my other people may like insect proteins but what about other organ Meats heart um I know I mean around the world you see the consumption of of lots of different organ Meats is there any evidence that that heart um is a good protein or are we I'm generally looking at skeletal muscle as the the best source of of amino acids uh Heart is also a good source of protein it's also high in CoQ10 which is is good for muscle Health but many people again we don't seem to eat that however other places eat the full animal but they are all they are all good sources of protein aside from collagen which would be that protein score of zero and if somebody insists on being vegan or vegetarian um let's just say Vegan what are their best options there are rice pea blends of protein which are absolutely suitable there are a lot of now fermented types of protein powders out there that seem to have the same profile as we the one thing that I would say as individual's age a a vegan diet can be very challenging need to make sure that you are getting enough B12 zinc iron things uh nutrients of concern that seem to be going down in general and we're seeing decreases of that um in the general population what are your thoughts on magnesium we sometimes hear that excellent people are magnesium deficient based on depletion of the soil o you hear this stuff but um what's the story with magnesium that is true there seems to be um less magnesium in the diet very easy to supplement whether the the form that you use whether you use a magnesium glycinate or there's a whole host of magnesium citrate for gastrointestinal Health whatever it is but yes magnesium supplementation can be very beneficial uh for muscle for brain do you support the idea of supplementing with zinc or is that something that is kind of you know sometimes yes sometimes no I think if you're eating a Whole Foods diet you're going to be unlikely to be deficient in zinc zinc is interesting because you don't want to supplement zinc without copper there is a zinc copper ratio that is well-maintained in the body supplementation with one or the other will typically deplete the other and you know as a geriatrician there's a a zinc copper ratio things that we think of as kind of proxies for overall brain health not saying that the zinc copper ratio is the only thing but certainly supplementing with one or the other one would be careful what are some things that people might be doing or taking that"}

{"question": "What are the potential therapeutic benefits of psychedelics in treating mental health conditions like PTSD and depression, and how do modern researchers approach their use compared to the counterculture movement of the 1960s and 1970s?", "doc_id": "X4QE6t-MkYE_22", "video_id": "X4QE6t-MkYE", "video_title": "Dr. Nolan Williams: Psychedelics & Neurostimulation for Brain Rewiring | Huberman Lab Podcast #93", "video_header": "Clinical Use of Psychedelics", "segment_idx": "22", "time_start": "1:57:18", "time_end": "2:01:55", "context": "I mean, there's this kind of, as you said earlier, Timothy Leary kind of sociocultural construct that ends up being overlaid over psychedelics. And what I think is that if you rid yourself of all of those preconceived notions of what it is and isn't, and the counterculture movement, all that stuff that neither of us were ever involved in, neither of us are ever partake in, you know, as kind of straight scientists looking at this, right? If you can kind of rid yourself of all those sociocultural constructions and then reexamine this, if we just discovered these today, we would say that these sorts of drugs are a huge breakthrough in psychiatry because they allow for us to do a lot of the sorts of things we've been thinking about with SSRIs, with psychotherapy, but kind of combined, right? Psychotherapy plus drugs in a substance that kind of allows you to reexamine these things. And so it's interesting. There's a lot to do to try to figure out if that's true, you know? And I can say that as it stands right now, we don't know if that statement is true, right? There's a lot more work that needs to happen for that statement to be proven to be true. But the hypothesis is, if it is true, then it's very likely that this will be seen as a breakthrough because it allows you to do these sorts of things that you can't do with normal waking consciousness. But also why we have to really think about this. And, you know, these drugs can't be recreational drugs. They really shouldn't be recreational drugs, right? They're really too powerful to be used in the context of recreation because they can put you into these states. And this generation of psychedelic researchers are really clear about that. You know, I think the '60s folks were not clear about that, and they felt like there was this whole kind of cultural thing that was going on there. But I think this cohort of individuals really understands that in order to really make this happen, we have to understand that if you need a prescription for an SSRI, which doesn't change your consciousness a whole lot, and we're very worried about that, and the doctor has to evaluate you for that every week, that the idea that some of these substances would go outside of very strict medical supervision is kind of preposterous actually. It's kind of a dumb moment, I think, for all of medicine to say, look, if we're going to do this right, we've got to do it such a way that's so protected, that's so safe, that we make sure people know these things are not recreational and they're really for the pure purposes of really powerfully changing cognition for a while and letting people have these what seem to be, you know, relatively therapeutic states. - I think it's great that you're doing this study. And along the lines of the sort of the early iterations of psychedelics and the counterculture of the '60s and '70s, some of which took place, like \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" I think is actually based on the Menlo Park VA, which is in our neighborhood of Stanford. And things are quite a bit different now. I know you and I have spent some time with the operators and former operators at an event, and last Veterans Day, in fact, the so-called Veteran Solutions group that's pioneering a lot of these psychedelic treatments for former special operators and current special operators. And what's interesting to me about that is in contrast to the counterculture movement of the '60s and '70s, that room was filled with people that are very much of a structure, the military. Right? So it's no longer considered left wing, right wing, anti-military, pro-military. Here this isn't just about one group of people who's exploring psychedelics as a treatment for trauma and PTSD and other things. And of course you also have other domains of society looking at this. And in fact, there were, but it was really interesting because there were both far left and far right politicians at that event up on stage together, talking about, in kind of lighter terms, heart medicine, but also talking about neurobiology and talking. It was just fascinating from the perspective of somebody who's trying to learn about this stuff, that psychedelic therapies no longer sit within the anti-establishment realm. It's independent of all that, certainly when people in the military are adopting it as a potential treatment.

So for instance, our bicep is a flexor and our tricep is an extensor. Those are what are called antagonistic muscles. They move the limbs in opposite directions. So if you bring your wrist closer to your shoulder, that's flection using your bicep. If you move your wrist further away from your shoulder, that's extension, using your tricep. And without getting into a lot of detail the way that the nerves and brain are wired up to muscle make it such that when a flexor is activated, when the nerve dumps chemical acetylcholine onto the muscle to activate the biceps, the triceps is inhibited. It's prevented from engaging. There are ways to bypass this but that's the typical mode of action. The converse is also true when our tricep is in activated, when we move our wrist away from our shoulder our bicep is inhibited. And we have flexors like our abdominal muscles. And we have extensors in our lower back. Many of you probably know this but some of you probably don't that your spine has flexors to move basically your chin toward your waist. And it has, those are your abdominal muscles among others. And you have extensors that move your chin, basically back like looking up toward the ceiling. And those are your extensors. You have other muscles that are stabilizing muscles and things of that sort but those movements of flection and extension, and the fact that they are what we call reciprocally innovated or mutual inhibition, you hear different language around this is characteristic of most of our limb movements. So hamstring and quadriceps, the hamstring brings the ankle closer back towards the glutes. Basically it's lifting your heel up which is almost always done toward the back. Whereas your quadriceps is the extensor opposite to the hamstrings. So you get the idea. So there's flexors and extensors and it's the neurons that control those flexors and extensors that allow us to move in particular ways. So, now you have heard a neuromuscular physiology in its simplest form, but I do want this to be accessible. I want to get just briefly, just briefly into some of the underlying metabolism"}

of supplemented NR maybe nmn as well but certainly supplemented NR for sake of lowering inflam to offset some of the negative effects of time zone shift alcohol um I have a few others listed here um overnutrition yeah so let's talk about that so so in 20 I don't remember what year it was it was somewhat recent um a study was published looking at NR with uh uh something called teras Bean so tertill Bean is believed to be a ceran activator like RIS veratrol so commercially available product called basis and it was tested there was a it was a three arm study in humans um roughly 30 people per arm so decent size study right this is a big study so you take 100 people more or less with fatty liver disease now this was documented with um uh an MRI of the liver so um they're looking at um hepatic fat in the liver um by Mr and um using this type of MRI if your hepatic fat index is over 5% that's a high enough degree of what's called steatosis that you have fatty liver disease now of course this is not um this is not an a digital thing it's an analog right there's a there's a spectrum to this so so you know you start with just fat accumulating in the liver but as more and more fat accumulates you start to get inflammation that results in scarring and fibrosis and ultimately you would get to therosis so just keep in back of your mind the Threshold at which we would say you're you're in the you're get you're in the danger zone is once you hit 5% so this study randomize people to either uh a placebo or a regular dose of this product or a double dose of the product and I can't remember exactly how much is in the product I think it's either 250 or 500 so then that would be what the regular group got of NR and then the other group was getting 2x that so it's either 250 and 500 or 500 and a th000 I don't recall um they also looked at something called the um they looked at many things right so they looked at all sorts of biomarkers um and the primary outcome for the study was did you see a reduction of this hepatic fat via the MRI um so what happened so they they did the study and uh lo and behold there was no difference there was no difference in anything okay so so at high dose at lowd dose there was no difference in how much hepatic fat you had at the end of the there was no difference in body weight there was no difference in inflammatory markers there was no difference in glycemic markers glucose levels liver function tests any of those things so in that sense it was a null study H but they did one subanalysis which again you have to be very careful of because a subanalysis is not a primary outcome but it's kind of a way to go and parse the data and they did find one statistically one statistically significant finding which was if you limited the analysis to people who had a hepatic fat score below 27% remember I said once you're above 5% you're you're sort of you have fatty liver disease well they had people anywhere from you know 10% to 40% wow but if they looked at people who were below 27% in the lowd do group there was a statistically significant reduction in liver fat if it sounds like I'm masting I am let me say it again if you limited the analysis to people who had below 27% on this hepatic fat index the people who got the full dose had no difference they averaged 20% at the beginning of the trial and 19% at the end no statistically significant difference the placebo group averaged 20% at the beginning 20% at the end but the single dose of the drug went from 20 % to 15% which was statistically significant it's not clear that that's clinically significant which is a pretty consistent theme in this type of research never confuse statistical significance with clinical significance if I gave you if your blood pressure is 160 over 100 and I give you a drug that lowers it to 157 over 97 that could be statistically significant if the variance is small enough between people in the study it has no clinical significance I haven't changed the course of your life so again that to me is one of the one of the two big findings that people point to to say aha there was some benefit in fatty liver disease with this but again when you read the fine print which I just vomited out to you I I don't think anybody's looking at that going oh we we just found the solution to to Naf D the second study that people point to a lot was 2021 or 2022 um this came out of a group at washu I believe and they looked at nmn and they looked at glucose disposal so in this study they asked the question um we're going to take two groups of people you're going to get a placebo for a period of time or you're going to get nmn for a period of time and um we're going to then do what's called a a a type of glucose challenge where we look at how well you dispose of glucose with and without insulin infusion and in the uh placebo group you would look at pre and post glucose so so pre- and post Placebo treatment was there a difference in glucose disposal with no insulin no what about with insulin where you would expect to see much more glucose disposal no difference but when you did that with the nmn group there was a statistically significant increase in glucose disposal with insulin infusion but it was quite small in other words it was clinically very insignificant and just to make just to sort of figure out how insignificant it was I went back and actually looked at some of the red light data because there's an interesting study that shines red light on a person's back and then does an oral glucose tolerance test yeah and you can actually reduce like postprandial glucose by 8% is that meaningful not really I mean not in this not in this patient population because these people were all pre-diabetic they had very high glucose so it was again another example of something that was statistically significant but not clinically significant and the same thing was true in this study right but again people would would probably point to these St two studies because they're Inhumans and you had this one if you squint and look really hard and take a Sub sub subset of the analysis on this one measurement we saw you know a result a response of hepatic fat going from 20 to 15% which is still 3x above the threshold to hepati liver disease and in this other study you had this you know very very modest reduction pardon me increase in glucose disposal but I mean like we're you know there's a saying in my in my sort of Mind Andrew which is like if you have to resort to really interesting statistical machinations to see something there probably isn't something very interesting there right right I totally agree and I think you"}

disrupting nighttime sleep by napping but also this uh rather common phenomenon of waking up and feeling kind of groggy or even I'm kind of grumpy the post-nap face uh or we should call the post-nap expression right right the P NE what's your P are do you wake up um in the and for morning too some people wake up and they're like that that face and then there's the like good morning you know and I think people that wake up with the good morning are particularly delightful unless you're of the post Snap expression that is kind of the the crumpled face and then you just you don't want to be around those people right no absolutely um yeah and this probably relates to spirit animals and things like that some people wake up like a like a cheerful chipmunk and other people seem to wake up like my Bulldog Costello where it's you know um jowls still in contact with the floor yeah so um P I'm trying to hold it together and not Absol just fall apart it's brilliant please trademarket so firstly to your question how to optimally nap the word optimal is interesting because when you people say how long should I nap what's the optimal nap duration the question I have back to them is what are you trying to optimize because once I understand what you're trying to optimize I can give you a better prescription non-medical I'm talking about here the a better sort of you know protocol piece of advice for how to nap I mentioned the study about emotional faces in part for a specific reason cuz I told you there the benefit came by way not of non REM sleep but REM sleep and in our first episode we said that when you go through these on average 90minut Cycles you get most of your non-rem sleep first and then you'll have this bout of REM sleep at the end and it always seems to go that way when you are a healthy normal person you go into non-rem sleep and then you go into REM sleep it's very rare that you ever go directly into REM sleep there are only two reasons when that seems to happen the first is a clinical condition called noopsy where you can have sleep onset REM sleep and very rare the second is if you are horrifically deprived of REM sleep night after night after night and I let you sleep then at that point REM sleep the pressure for REM sleep has been built to to the point of being almost just insatiable and your brain goes straight into REM sleep but with those two things aside you go into non-rem sleep first so I brought up the emotional study of resetting your sort of mood uh compass because to get that REM sleep you had to nap for a longer period of time because you had to get through the non-rem sleep first before you get the REM sleep but let's come back to then assuming optimal is for most people when they speak about naps I just want the quick reboot I want my alertness and concentration which are failing because I'm staring at the screen or I just can't concentrate on the work that I'm doing I want my alertness and my concentration to be improved proved I want that sort of slight boost in brain energy where I know I can sustain myself for now a longer period of time and I've got the motivation which is really in some ways how I like to think about energy as well I've got the motivation the drive to keep going which is just starting to fail me to get those basic things which is what most people nap for aim for 20 minute nap why 20 minutes if I thin slice the nap duration and and those Studies have been done where we look at essentially what's called a dose response curve I give you 5 minutes of a nap 10 minutes of a nap 15 minutes 20 minutes 30 minutes 45 minutes 90 minutes after 5 or 10 minutes you don't really get very much you will wake up and you'll have some degree of improved alertness and your basic reaction time may be a little bit quicker but that Fades very quickly and you don't sustain that benefit once you get past about 15 to 17 minutes now things start to look different you get these nice benefits for concentrational alertness and motivation and those things sustain so once you wake up out of that probably really I would say 20 minute nap at that point you've got some good wind in your concentration and energy sales for the brain and that will sustain you throughout the rest of the afternoon and into the evening the benefit of the 20-minute nap is that you don't get the PNE trademark Andrew hubman you don't get that almost sleep hangover so some people will say it's strange I nap maybe I'll nap 45 minutes 50 minutes and I wake up and to be honest Matt I almost feel worse after the nap than I did before and I don't understand it it's something called Sleep inertia and an extreme version of this is in the first two hours of your night of sleep you get a phone call or an alarm goes off and you wake up and you are just kind of lost in the ocean you're looking around at your surroundings you're just in this groggy State you're half awake half asleep and you can respond and you can do things but boy does it feel miserable and it's almost as though you're going from the ground floor right up to the penthouse suite but you get stuck somewhere in between kind of you know floor 13 and it's this rough state if you go out into sleep light stage one nonrem then stage two nonr and just before you get into the very deepest stages of non Ram 3 and four that starts to happen around 30 to 40 minutes for most people but by cutting your nap off at 20 minutes you still get these nice benefits from a good chunk of healthy non-rem sleep but you're not going so far into the cycle so deep into your nonr that when you wake up after 20 minutes you're not in that what we call Sleep inertia phase that sleep grogginess that sleep hangover phase so it's a nice benefit that you get all of these improvements in your brain but you wake up and very quickly you're back up to operating temperature and you don't suffer that inertia now that's not to say that when you sleep or you nap longer you don't start to get more benefits you do and those benefits are both greater in their magnitude and sustain for a longer period of time they do it's just that you have to understand the tradeoff that you will suffer which is I will get more bang for my book and I will get more benefits but I will in the first sort of hour or so have to understand that at that point I may even be functioning worse than than that which I did before I even started napping but if you're patient and you go through it the rewards on the other side are significantly better still so that's the first piece of advice and when it comes to how to nap I would say the dose and the timing make the poison and poison is hyperbole in here it's simply just the poison being how much sleep and nurs you're going to suffer so aim for about 20 minutes that's the do the timing comes back to that which we described before do not nap too late into the day so what's the rule of thumb here for a protocol on average for the average adult I would say don't nap after about 300 p.m. 20 minute naps sometime between 300 p.m. and if you're struggling with sleep don't do this at all if you're not and you're able to get to sleep fine this seems to be a good ingredient for the basic return on your investment again if you tell me what's the optimal nap duration we need to have a conversation to understand what is it that you're going after here what are the benefits and then I can sort of you know create a finger Buffet Kaleidoscope match to what you need and we can think about the nap duration as a consequence thank you that's very informative um I"}

And we know that heart rate variability is good. You don't want your heart rate chronically elevated or chronically low. A lot of people think, \"Oh, I want a really nice low heart rate.\" And indeed, if you're in shape, the stroke volume of your heart will be greater and you can have a nice slow heart rate. Years ago when I was running regularly, I think my heart rate was down to like 50 or 60 or something like that. That's great. But, and now it's higher than that because I'm running a little bit less. But everyone needs to determine what's right for them. But you don't really want your heart rate to be chronically low or chronically high. Both are bad. We know that chronic stress, elevated stress and especially in the so-called type A personalities creates heart disease, the leading killer of for in most, every country, but in particular in the US. Because of the way that adrenaline impacts those blood vessels or constricting some and dilating others, it's just that kind of hypertension, chronic hypertension is just bad. And so, chronic stress truly is bad. I want to really make that clear because I emphasized a lot of what some of the positive effects of stress.

people get things confused as to whether or not a given peptide that one would use as a therapeutic falls into one or the other category and you'll see in a minute it's a really important distinction instead what I'm going to call these are category one peptides and Category 2 peptides okay in general category one peptides are going to be the ones that have been most thoroughly tested in humans in some cases in fact in several cases are FDA approved for certain conditions and yes are prescribed for other off label effects again this would be under what I'm calling type one growth hormone secreting peptides is celin celin is a synthetic compound designed to mimic naturally occurring growth hormone releasing hormone that is FDA approved for the treatment of short stature so you can get this by prescription sometimes it comes from a compounding pharmacy other times it comes directly from PHA for the name brand in any case celin has been shown to mimic what is normally released from the hypothalamus and stimulates the pituitary to release growth hormone and it does indeed cause increases in circulating growth hormone and increases in igf-1 by the way the typical dosages of celin that are um taken are anywhere from 200 to 400 micrograms typically that's done at night before sleep for the reasons that we talked about before and typically people will take it anywhere from three times per week or five times per week there are some disadvantages to taking it continuously 7 days per week for long periods of time there's some desensitization that can occur not much but some can occur so taking in that way celin has been shown to increase circulating levels of growth hormone and igf-1 and the the reason why a lot of people seek to take cellin is because they like the effects it produces they like the Vitality they like the muscle growth they like The Fat Loss um it also can increase the amount of deep sleep that you get I'll just be completely forthcoming I've taken cellan on and off for the last couple of years I typically will take it anywhere from one to two nights per week and I stop taking it almost completely I'll still take it every once in a great while but the reason I stopped taking it is that I noticed that it made the sleep in the early part of my night very very deep very robust but then I would wake up wide awake or I would sleep till morning and then at least according to my eight sleep sleep tracker or my whoop sleep tracker I wasn't getting nearly as much rapid eye movement sleep as I normally would so at least in my case and again this is anic data it seemed to sort of replace rapid eye movement sleep with more deep sleep and rapid eye movement sleep is critical for all sorts of things that deep sleep can't achieve and vice versa so you really want both so this is one reason why I've basically stopped taking Calin I'll occasionally take it every once in a while but in general I just you know stop taking it because uh whatever the positive effects might have been if I had taken it more consistently the effects in depleting rapid eye movement sleep were just something I didn't want and don't want and by the way that effect on increasing deep sleep that non-r sleep is something that's pretty well documented the other what I'm calling type one growth hormone promoting peptide is tesamorelin this goes by the brand name grifta and it's an FDA approved drug for the reduction of visceral adiposity in HIV patients so we have subcutaneous fat and we have visceral fat around our organs visceral fat can be really problematic and for some people who have HIV or and for people who don't have HIV the deposits of visceral fat can be problematic for their health and tesamorelin again also called AG gria has been shown to reduce visceral adiposity it also seems to produce some of the other same effects that celin produces the differences between the two relate to small differences in the amino acid sequence for one peptide versus the other tesamorelin is a bit more long lasting than celin and therefore is taken typically about three times per week not five times per week now the third most commonly used peptide in this category of what I'm calling type one growth hormone secreting peptides is cjc-1295 gosh I wish there was a um an easier name CJ c1295 is basically a variant of a different growth hormone secreting peptide that was sized previously to which they add what's called a DAC a drug Affinity complex it's a it's a sequence that makes it very longlasting so cjc-1295 typically is only taken twice per week or even once per week because its effects on increasing growth hormone in igf-1 last several days which may sound great to you especially if you're somebody that doesn't like um taking injections because these things uh in general have to be uh delivered by injection but keep in mind that cjc-1295 has entered clinical trials there was a death within one of the clinical trials that was related to cardiovascular dysfunction it's known to cause some fluid retention and increased fluid volume which may have been related to that cardiovascular death we don't know okay this is all kind of speculation but I would say if you are somebody considering using a growth hormone secreting peptide the type one category is perhaps and I'll give my explanation for why I believe this to be the case perhaps the most advantageous category to explore and as I mentioned before you've got the options of cellan and tessarin both of which are FDA approved and for which there's both animal and human data CJC 1295 despite still being in clinical trials does have this kind of stain of a death within the clinical trial and to my mind given that there are decent Alternatives in serel and or tesamorelin I don't know why anyone would specifically select cjc-1295 until all these safety issues have been resolved I'd like to take a quick break to acknowledge our sponsor element element is an

um I'm aware that the hypothalamus and some of these deeper brain structures associated with more um let's call them primitive drives um temperature regulation uh hunger Etc connect to the body but uh what what's the nature of some of the connections with the front to the body yeah I was just sort of talking in terms of of our knowledge of how you know changing on one of your podcast you talked about how TMS to the prefrontal cortex can slow heart rate so I meant in that in that sort of way got it that that that yeah by by that by influencing cortical function will obviously we can influence uh organs like the got it so through some intermediate stations yes yeah I mean it's you know not to um not to be hyperbolic but I mean it seems like the prefrontal cortex here we referring to as the frontal loes um are essentially the seat of what makes us human and What Makes Us functional or dysfunctional in a given context right I mean uh I recall there's a syndrome cluver buy syndrome which has some vague um uh similarities to how you describe frontal cortex damage but there as I recall humans or animals um with that syndrome will act in a way that's not appropriate to context but more inappropriate like they'll they'll try and eat a ceramic cup or Draw with a piece of paper which obviously won't work it seems like with the frontal cortex it knows that a pen is for writing it just the person might say yeah I know I'm not supposed to write this but I'm just going to or write with it but I'm going to take your pen and write something inappropriate with it but it it's not that they people forget that there's a that it's a pen so it seems like it's drawing on um so rule sets but that something's intact it's like it's not like cluver buy syndrome where um like animals and people can try and like mate with inanimate art objects um which is one of the more Salient um symptoms I'll never forget that never forget that from from my cognitive Neuroscience course which you taught by the way um just throw that in there so yeah so how how should we think about this and here I'm trying to get at a kind of a broader understanding of brain function and context specific behavior um it so frontal cortex is like super sophisticated um but it doesn't have all the information right it seems like someone without a frontal cortex probably knows that you write with a pen you don't write with a piece of paper yeah I I think it's you know we think about it as it's you know the frontal CeX allows us to take thought and move it towards action and there's this disconnect between the knowledge and and action and the separation of action from knowledge and I guess I can reflect on my patience you know when I I've seen a lot of patients with damage all over the brain and all of the families of patients who have frontal Lo injury always say the same thing they're they're just no longer that person they're no longer my spouse they're no longer my best friend they're no longer my father just something they can't put it into words but they're not them anymore there's something has changed whereas if you talk to a patient with brok as aasia who has this inability to speak they can't get any words out you know this is a devastating problem they're still the same person they they they their personality hasn't changed they they feel the same person they just can't speak the way they get around in the world is different or if you take a patient with prosopagnosic which is uh this inability to recognize faces of course the way they navigate around the world is is is difficult and it's not the same but they're still the same person so there's something really special about the frontal cortex that allows us to be as you said sort of who we are and that's the difficult part like how does the frontal Lopes allow us sort of take um take who we are and translate that into knowledge so we're not I guess in other words saying just just having knowledge isn't what makes us who we are right it's to be able to take that knowledge and and and present it in a way that allows us to live life based on our intentions and our goals and our desires so much of things like stoic philosophy and um and even online Wellness culture are about um having routines um you know overcoming reflex by just having recipes scripts to follow each day um I certainly try to have my mornings be as what I call linear as possible and I find it's much easier in the earlier part of the day to just decide here's what I'm going to do write out a list do things in a certain sequence if I don't do that I go nonlinear as I refer to it and we'll get distracted and things of that sort but um earlier you mentioned sleep deprivation can impair frontal Lo function it does seem that um as the day progresses and certainly in the middle of the night it just becomes much harder to um control our our thinking maybe even our Behavior but um and certainly our emotions is there a frontal lob uh regulation of emotional states as well I know you have some recent work on this so i' love to hear more yeah yeah I mean as I was saying earlier the frontal L is a big place and and half of it is involved in these high level executive functions but the other half of it is in is part of the lyic system or that we call it the paralic system that's involved in Social and emotional behavior and so uh there's this intimate back and forth between these two areas of the cortex if you have just damage to these frontal to these areas that are kind of in the overal frontal lobe you will have many different impairments that we would call sort of social or emotional impairments and they're executive function will be quite normal and then you'll have the the opposite where patients with the lateral damage will have executive functions but they seem emotionally intact but but you know in real life when we have both these intact they're they're communicating with each other so right emotion and context and is going to influence our executive function we make bad decisions in stressful situations or situations we're not comfortable with it's it's where we might make a better decision if it's a quiet you know kind of quiet place um but it is something that we can I think you you're right you can you can sort of get into a routine and learn how to do things you know if you have very much planned out but what's so unique about us is how we can be flexible and adaptable right when when something novel comes up or there's something something unexpected comes up we can adapt to it and that's really what the frontal cortex is really important for um not just sort of making these plans routines and setting all the rules but being a when things don't go right how to how to write the ship right I will"}

How much time is too much? I mean, I think it's going to depend on what one is looking at, the age of the user, et cetera. MARK ZUCKERBERG: I agree. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I know that you have tools that cue the user to how long they've been on a given platform. Are there tools to self-regulate-- I'm thinking about the Greek myth of the sirens and people tying themselves to the mast and covering their eyes so that they're not drawn in by the sirens. Is there a function aside from deleting the app temporarily and then reinstalling it every time you want to use it again? Is there a true lockout, self-lockout function where one can lock themselves out of access to the app? MARK ZUCKERBERG: Well, I think we give people tools that let them manage this. And there's the tools that you get to use. And then there's the tools that the parents get to use to basically see how usage works. But yeah, I think that there's different-- I think, for now, we've mostly focused on helping people understand this, and then give people reminders and things like that. It's tough, though, to answer the question that you were talking about before. Is there an amount of time which is too much? Because it does really get to what you're doing. If you fast forward beyond just the apps that we have today to an experience that is like a social experience in the future of the augmented reality glasses or something that we're building, a lot of this is going to be you're interacting with people in the way that you would physically as if you were like hanging out with friends or working with people. But now, they can show up as holograms. And you can feel like you're present right there with them, no matter where they actually are. And the question is, is there too much time to spend interacting with people like that? Well, at the limit, if we can get that experience to be as rich and giving you as good of a sense of presence as you would have if you were physically there with someone, then I don't see why you would want to restrict the amount that people use that technology to any less than what would be the amount of time that you'd be comfortable interacting with people physically, which obviously is not going to be 24 hours a day. You have to do other stuff. You have work. You need to sleep. But I think it really gets to how you're using these things, whereas if what you're primarily using the services for is you're getting stuck in loops reading news or something that is really getting you into a negative mental state, then I don't know. I mean, I think that there's probably a relatively short period of time that maybe that's a good thing that you want to be doing. But again, even then it's not zero because just because news might make you unhappy doesn't mean that the answer is to be unaware of negative things that are happening in the world. I just think that different people have different tolerances for what they can take on that. And I think it's generally having some awareness is probably good, as long as it's not more than you're constitutionally able to take. So I don't know. I try not be too paternalistic about this as our approach. But we want to empower people by giving them the tools, both people and, if you're a teen, your parents to have tools to understand what you're experiencing and how you're using these things, and then go from there. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. I think it requires of all of us some degree of self-regulation. I like this idea of not being too paternalistic. I mean, it seems like the right way to go. I find myself occasionally having to make sure that I'm not just passively scrolling, that I'm learning. I like foraging for, organizing and dispersing information. That's been my life's career. So I've learned so much from social media. I find great papers, great ideas. I think comments are a great source of feedback. And I'm not just saying that because you're sitting here. I mean, Instagram in particular, but other Meta platforms have been tremendously helpful for me to get science and health information out. One of the things that I'm really excited about,"}

very many books they're definitely scrolling social media they're carrying out their daily tasks with you know apparently uh High degree of functionality um but they're not really pushing these forbrain circuits do we imagine that some of those forbrain circuits regress um AKA use it or lose it um seems to me that a few years back maybe 10 15 years back there was a lot of interest in you know how to maintain cognitive function in fact one of the most common questions I would get even as a neuroscientist primarily focused on the visual and autonomic nervous system was how do I keep my memory as I age it seems to me that training it up and then continuing to use those circuits is would be a really good way reading books without forcing oneself to finish the chapter even though distractions jump into one's head things like that um for me it's when I go to the gym I not to bring my phone and if I do I'll listen to one album of music but I won't allow myself to play on my phone I try I mean not interrupting a conversation with text messaging I mean basically the the landscape I'm trying to uh draw here is seems like the world is designed to to disrupt that the modern world is designed to disrupt working memory and cognition of the frontal loes right right and we need to do some real training just like muscles and atrophy and cardiac Fitness atrophies if we're not doing ready uh you know resistance and cardiovascular training is that set yeah I think that's fair I think you know of all the systems uh that decline with aging not every brain system declines but certainly the frontal executive system we're talking about is one that takes more of a decline than others that's just how it is with with healthy aging um not surprising it's it's the most complicated system and it's probably the most biologically costly and so you know the more complicated system is going to uh take more of a hit than than other systems and so certainly um I don't know about regressing but certainly we're not we maybe accelerating this this this uh decline that we know exist and but a way I would think about it though is is that not just um trying to prevent the decline but what we talked about before there's no reason not to optimize I mean if if everything is couched and I don't want to get dementia and don't want to get Alzheimer's disease and I don't want to get this and that I think that's not the way we should be looking about it we want to look about op optimizing health and and uh brain health and and and getting up to our optimal levels um because otherwise we're always playing defense instead of playing playing offense and that's really hard for neurologists we we have a hard time thinking about brain health even though we're the brain Specialists we think about brain disease and we're just now as a field start thinking about preventative neurology which seems and and thinking about it not just like stopping Alzheimer's disease but uh promoting healthy Health in a healthy brain just you know neurologists don't talk to patients about or healthy patients about being healthier I love how candid you are about the medical profession um and I like to think it's changing I don't know something happened in the in the 2020 2021 um era I I feel is just my my bias but I feel that the general public started becoming more aware of the things they might do to support their mental and physical health maybe they had more more time on their hands but I think there was just more foraging for information um I love the idea that through simple practices like forcing oneself to read a book chapter start to finish without looking at one's phone um even if it takes twice as long as one would like um redirecting one's focus when what Focus moves away is it's a way of keeping working memory and cognitive function online maybe even strengthening it as you said optimizing it um you know I think that there so much emphasis now on physical health which I think is great sleep thanks to Matt Walker you know you really you know brought that torch in on sleep um and now others like myself are are really you know trying to amplify the message of the critical role of sleep but also you know most people realize they should probably at least walk um as you know the 10,000 steps thing is not a bad idea um getting some heart rate up a few times a week or more maybe doing some resistance training a few times a week or more and then and not just for athletes but for elderly folks men and women you know um I feel like we need the same for cognition for me for uh brain function and there just isn't a structure to that no one can say right now you know you need to do uh three chapters of reading you know fiction per week or uh you got to read a you got to learn a few new vocabulary words and then write sentences with them they do it in school but then we're just you know set into the general population and right and most people I think regress right yeah I mean I I think the big problem uh with brain health is is trying to have a measure of what brain health is and it's interesting to me again as a physician um thinking about it from a neurologist standpoint um when you go to your family doctor your primary care physician every year from your yearly physical uh they examine every organ in your body except your brain your lung your heart you know your skull system your skin but what what do they do for you you know outside of having a conversation with you no cognitive task there's nothing no working memory task they don't measure your your brain at all and it's not their fault there we haven't provideed the field do not provided them with a test of of of brain health right and so part of the problem is we don't have a measurement of brain health I'm involved and something called the brain health project which is at UT Dallas um which is their goal is a study to enroll 100,000 people in uh and they've been developing a brain health index and that's a complicated thing to do but I I really believe they're on to something because it's not just cognition it's cognition it's it's social it's it's lifestyle like sleep and and it's it's um well-being you the brain a brain health index is going to cover all of these aspects so they've developed quite a interesting uh important index which which can um which does try to capture all aspects of brain health and then can be used to track uh where you can track your brain health over time with interventions that they've they've developed so we we need something like we need to First once we develop a brain health index that's that then then we have something to to follow and to and to be able to measure if if if we are optimizing our brain health otherwise how do you know if you're you're optimizing your your brain health you don't your doctor's not telling you you don't know um all these games you get on in the web

{"question": "Can nicotine or other supplements like alpha-GPC or choline really help increase focus and alertness in the brain?", "doc_id": "LG53Vxum0as_31", "video_id": "LG53Vxum0as", "video_title": "How to Focus to Change Your Brain", "video_header": "Nicotine for Focus", "segment_idx": "31", "time_start": "49:45", "time_end": "52:24", "context": "People say, \"What can I take to increase my levels of acetylcholine?\" Well, there are things you can take. Nicotine is called nicotine because acetylcholine binds to the nicotinic receptor. There are two kinds of acetylcholine receptors, muscarinic and nicotinic, but the nicotinic ones are involved in attention and alertness. I have colleagues, these are not my, you know kind of like bro, science buddies, I have those friends too, this is a Nobel prize winning colleague who chews Nicorette while he works. He used to be a smoker. He quit smoking because of fear of lung cancer, seemed like a smart choice, but he missed the level of focus that he could bring to his work. This is somebody who has had very long career. And if you ever meet with him, unfortunately I can't name him. If you ever meet with him what you realize is he chews about five pieces of Nicorette an hour, which I am not suggesting people do. But when I asked him, \"Why are you doing this?\" He said, \"Well, increases my alertness and focus.\" And also his theory and I want to really underscore that it's theory not scientifically supported yet, is that it offsets Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. It is true that nucleus basalis is the primary site of degeneration in the brain, in people that have dementia and Parkinson's and it's what leads to a lot of their inability to focus their attention, not just deficits and plasticity. So he might be onto something. Now I've tried chewing Nicorette, it makes me super jittery. I don't like it because I can't focus very well. It kind of takes me too far up the level of autonomic arousal. I've got friends that dip Nicorette all day, some of whom are scientists, writers and artists and musicians are familiar with the effects of nicotine from the era where a lot of people smoked and fortunately fewer people smoke now. So if you're interested in the pharmacology, there are supplements and things that can increase cholinergic transmission in the brain. I'm not suggesting you do this but if you're going to go down that route, you want to be very careful how much you rely on those all the time. Because the essence of plasticity is to create a window of attention and focus that's distinct from the rest of your day. That's what's going to create a mark in your brain and the potential for plasticity. Things that increase acetylcholine, besides nicotine or Nicorette, the nicotine could come from a variety of sources or things like alpha-GPC or choline. There are a number of these things. I would encourage you to go to examine.com, the website and just put in acetylcholine and it will give you a list of supplements as well as some of the dangers of these supplements that are associated with cholinergic transmission. But I would be remiss and I would be lying if I didn't say that there are a lot of people out there who are using cholinergic drugs in order to increase their level of focus."}

{"question": "What is the current understanding of recovery from concussion and how does it relate to general brain aging and cognitive decline?", "doc_id": "mcPSRWUYCv0_17", "video_id": "mcPSRWUYCv0", "video_title": "Control Pain & Heal Faster with Your Brain", "video_header": "Concussion, TBI & Brain Ageing", "segment_idx": "17", "time_start": "37:34", "time_end": "40:46", "context": "I have many colleagues that are. At some point, we will do a whole month on TBI because it's such a serious issue and it's such a huge discussion, but I want to talk a little bit about what is known about recovery from concussion, and this is very important because it has implications for just normal aging as well and offsetting some of the cognitive decline and physical decline that occurs with normal aging. We shouldn't think of TBI as just for the football players or just for the kids that had an injury or just for the person that was in the car accident. We want to learn about TBI and understand TBI for those folks, but we're also going to talk about TBI as it relates to general degradation of brain function because there's a certain resemblance there of TBI to general brain aging. Typically after TBI, there are a number of different things that happen and there are a huge range of things that can create TBI. Neurologists and the emergency room physicians are going to want to know was the skull itself injured or did the brain rattle around in the skull? Was there actually a breach through the skull? Is there a physical object in there? How many concussions has the person had? Everyone's situation with TBI is incredibly different, but there's a constellation of symptoms that many people, if not all people with TBI, report which is headache, photophobia, that lights become aversive, sleep disruption, trouble concentrating, sometimes mood issues. There's a huge range and of course the severity will vary, et cetera. In a previous episode, I mentioned the Kennard Principle. The Kennard Principle, named after the famous neurologist, named by and after the famous neurologist Margaret Kennard, said that if you're going to get a brain injury, better to get it early in life than later in life and that's because the brain has a much greater or heightened capacity for repairing itself early in life than later, but of course, none of us want TBI and you can't pick when you get your TBI. You can avoid certain activities that would give you TBI, but really, when it comes to TBI, there are a couple of things that are agreed upon across the board. The first one is, as much as possible you want to avoid a second traumatic brain injury or concussion. That's going to be a tough one for some of the athletes and even recreational athletes to swallow because they want to continue in their sport, and I'm not here to tell you that you should or you shouldn't, but that's simply the way that it is. For folks that are in military or that are in certain professions, construction is a place where we see a lot of TBI. It's not always just football. A lot of construction workers are dealing with heavy objects swinging around in space. They wear those hardhat helmets, which unfortunately don't protect much against a lot of those blunt forces and certainly not against falls and things of that sort. Many people, in order to survive and feed their families, have to go back to work. It's very clear that regardless of whether or not there was a skull break and regardless of when the TBI happened and how many times it's happened, that the system that repairs the brain, the adult brain, is mainly centered around this lymphatic system that we call, for the brain, the glymphatic system."}

emerged to fill this gap?", "doc_id": "qNzl12g0Dd8_21", "video_id": "qNzl12g0Dd8", "video_title": "U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy: Efforts & Challenges in Promoting Public Health",

know growing up in the 70s and 80s I was exposed to like Community soccer teams swim team there was a community pool these were all public uh things uh there were um churches synagogues and mosques are we not seeing as much participation in those those types of organizations anymore and what other types of organizations are are out there that um you know come to mind when you think about the isolation crisis yeah so there there are several factors that have led to us being as isolated as we are one of them as you mentioned is the decline in participation in community organizations and this isn't a recent phenomenon this has been happening over the last half century in America we've seen lower participation in faith organizations in recreational leagues in service organizations and other community groups that used to bring us together and I think you know we can talk about the reasons why that has been the case U but one of the key consequences of that is that people don't have places where they can come together and get to know one another especially across differences so we actually associate more and more with people who are like us but this has also been fueled by a few other factors uh that are going on at the same time one is that just from a cultural perspective as modernity has arrived not just in the US but in other other countries we've seen that people are more mobile right they move around more we don't always stay in the community that we grew up in uh we tend to even if we move somewhere else for a school we may go somewhere else for a job we may change jobs and move somewhere else we are leaving behind communities that we grew up with that we went to school with that we worked with and I'm not saying that's all a bad thing right we're having more opportunities and that's a really good thing but I think one thing that we have not accounted for is the cost of these changes right if we know what the costs are of certain actions we may still take those actions but we may find ways to mitigate the the costs we may in this case invest more in our relationships be more conscious about reaching out to other people going to visit at them uh but that has been a a quiet but but devastating Consequence the other piece with modernity is that we have more convenience in our life which means that we also don't need to see other people to get certain things done like buying groceries or mailing an item out or getting something from the store I can sit in the comfort of my home and have everything just come to me now on the one hand that's incredibly efficient right but I think efficiency is an interesting thing because it's only one factor we should be considering in our lives there too we have to ask the cost and one interesting thing about Co is many people in the first year of Co when we were all separated from one another you know when we finally came back together again I had so many people who said to me you know what I expected to miss my parents and my siblings and my friends not being able to see them what I didn't expect was missing the strangers that I saw at the coffee shop or the folks who I ran into the grocery store or seeing neighbors as I walked down the street like I actually missed that more than I thought I would so we have lost out on some of those interactions and those loose ties but the final thing to keep in mind also is about what is happening with how we are using social media technology which I think is fundamentally transformed how we interact with one another and how we see ourselves and each other and this is particularly true for young people uh who are growing up as digital natives but what has happened there I worry is that and and it's not that social media is all bad just to be clear you know technology look I'm I'm a believer that in technology broadly speaking you know I'm a user of technology I spent seven years building a tech company I'm a Believer in Tech but I think whether technology helps or hurts us is about how it's designed and ultimately about how it ends up being used and what we've seen with social media as well is that uh for many people it ended up leading to in-person connections being replaced with online connections um we came to somehow value and um almost seek out more and more followers and friends on social media feeling like somehow that made us more connected but the nature of dialogue also changed like as human beings we evolved over thousands of years to not just understand the words someone is saying but to hear the tone of their voice to see their facial expression like you and I are sitting across and and we're both processing like our body language right and I'm seeing you nod your head and I'm seeing your eyes focused like all of that matters to how we communicate um but also like you and I are less likely to say something hurtful right now to one another because we can see each other if I said something to hurtful to you like i' probably see the the pain or consternation on your face and that might give me pause right when you're communicating online with other people without any of that information or with any of the uh sort of barriers if you will that make you pause before you hurt someone it leads to a very different kind of communication uh one that can be quite hurtful at times and I also think that one thing people many people don't recognize is that to communicate with somebody else and reach out and build a relationship with someone it actually takes a certain amount of self-esteem to do that you have to believe the other person's going to want to hang out with you they're going to see something valuable in you and for many young people what has happened uh and I think frankly for many older people too is their experience on social media has shredded their self-esteem as they constantly comparing themselves to other people like when you and I were growing up uh you know in the ' 80s we we compared ourselves to other people too right people have from Millennia but what's fundamentally different now is that in a given day you can compare yourself to thousands of images that you see online that's actually literally what people young people tell me I do roundtables with college students and high school students all the time around the country and the three things they tell me most consistently about their experience of social media is it makes them feel worse about themselves worse about their friendships but they can't get off it because the platforms are designed to maximize the amount of time they spend on them so you put all of this together and I think what has happened is that we're talking more but we understand each other less we have a lot of information but we're lacking in the wisdom that comes from Human Relationships uh and I think that that's really hurt us you know we see it certainly in the data that tells us about mental and physical health outcomes but there's also the human suffering component Andrew like it's really heartbreaking for me to travel around the country to hear hear from people of all ages often in quiet whispers about their struggles with isolation about how they feel like they just don't matter at all about how they feel like they just don't have a place where they belong and it's these are people on the outside look perfectly fine right they're posting happy things online to Folks at work they're seeming like everything's going great this is why I always tell people like you loneliness is a great masquerader it can look like withdrawal and sadness it can look like anger and irritability it can look like aloofness as well and so it's only when we stop to ask someone how they're doing when we take pause for a moment to maybe reflect on what's happening in their life that we realize that wow the majority of people in our country are actually struggling with loneliness yeah I'm a firm believer that"}
{"question": "What draws you to wrestling as a source of creative energy and inspiration, allowing you to tap into the universal currency of delight and pleasure, while also exploring the blurred lines between reality and fiction in the sport?", "doc_id": "ycOBZZeVeAc_17", "video_id": "ycOBZZeVeAc", "video_title": "Rick Rubin: How to Access Your Creativity", "video_header": "Wrestling, Energy & Reality; Dopamine", "segment_idx": "17", "time_start": "1:35:40", "time_end": "1:49:39", "context": "Because when I was growing up, I lived South of the Cow Palace, and there was some wrestling going on there. I think back then it was WWF. There was a short stint in my childhood where I paid attention to, in particular, was it Koko B. Ware, the guy that had a Macaw? I was obsessed with tropical birds, and he would come in, and he put his tropical bird on the thing. And then George \"The Animal\" Steele, the guy that would eat the ring. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. So and-- RICK RUBIN: I believe he was a professor. Seriously. Seriously. Seriously. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Was he really? RICK RUBIN: In real life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amazing. RICK RUBIN: He was a professor, but he played Georgia \"The Animal\" Steele as a wrestler. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And I loved the movie The Wrestler, The Wrestler. RICK RUBIN: Darren Aronofsky movie. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It was Mickey Rourke. RICK RUBIN: With Mickey Rourke. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. One of the reasons I liked it is I once visited Asbury Park. Isn't that where that was filmed? There's a vacant-- he goes to visit his daughter. There's a vacant amusement park or abandoned amusement park scene there that was really eerie, still kind of haunts me a little bit. There's something about the East Coast in fall. All the places that people normally go just for the summer, that we don't have out here in the West coast, people in the East Coast are just tougher than we are. It still haunts me. Great movie. But I remember watching wrestling, and it was at that age, I think I was probably about 12, 13, maybe 11, 12, 13, where you're entering puberty, and puberty is a fundamental landmark of development. It's the most rapid period of aging. It's also when we start to change our rule set. Like certain people and certain kinds of interactions take on profoundly different meaning. Right? It's not just a reproductive competence time, and when kids, their bodies change. The rulebook changes fundamentally. RICK RUBIN: Our understanding of the world changes in that moment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. The moment that a child understands really what sex is and how they got there and that a lot of the stuff that we see in the world is kind of passively, or not so passively, being sent through that filter, it's like it's something. It changes the rule book of perception. I view this age, from about 11 to 13, at least for me was a unique transition point. Where the gap between what I perceived as reality and fiction was blurry. This is captured pretty well in that movie \"Stand By Me,\" where they're hanging around the campfire at night. And the kid says, who do you think would win in a fight between Superman and Mighty Mouse? And the other kid says, like you idiot, Mighty Mouse is a cartoon. Of course Superman would win. And like to me, that's being 11 and 1/2 or 12 years old. Where your understanding of reality as you know it is changing, but it's not completely crystallized into an adult form reality. RICK RUBIN: That sounds like a really healthy place to be, to me, like that. Not letting it crystallize, I think there's where the downfall happens. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So I have a question specifically about wrestling, but it's really about process. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I want to know whether or not you watch wrestling because it allows you to access the energy state in your body and mind and that mode of thinking in which reality, as one conceives it, is somewhat blurry. Or is it for a number of other reasons, which is fine. Is that the energy you're trying to export and bring to the creative process elsewhere, to life? Is it that anything is possible, or that we're dealing with archetypes? Because it doesn't matter if it's Koko B. Ware or Randy \"Macho Man\" Savage, or George \"The Animal\" Steele and the lovely Elizabeth. I guess I did watch a little bit of wrestling. They are archetypes, much like the Greek myths or the Bible or-- no disrespect to the Bible or to Greek myths or to wrestling, for that matter. Archetypes are a powerful filter for humans, but we know that they're a very limited filter too, because people aren't built like square wave functions. We have curves and contours and complexity. So what is the deal with your relationship to wrestling? RICK RUBIN: I think it maintains that playfulness. Anything is possible. We expect the unexpected all the time in wrestling. And it's a way to have a feeling of the energy of a sport with no competition. Everyone is working together to put on the best show they can. So it's more like a ballet than it is like a sporting event, and there's great skill involved. It's one of the few things that I can watch and really feel relaxed. It relaxes me. I don't feel like I have to think about it. I can just relax and enjoy it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: This brings up a topic that is very near and dear to my heart, which is this notion of dopamine schedules. I never want to reduce everything to dopamine, but dopamine is the universal currency of delight, pleasure, motivation seeking. There are other chemicals involved too, but there's a beautiful experiment and a couple of examples that I'll use as a foundation to more questions about wrestling and why it's powerful. And why other people may want to use wrestling or some other endeavor as a way to access creative energy and source. Earlier, we talked about you can train an animal to press a lever three times and then get reward, and it will learn three is the magic number for reward, and then it can switch. It takes a little bit of training, and then they can switch. But they can't do prime numbers. They can't do high abstraction schedules. Humans either. We're not very good at figuring out the rule set for optimal foraging. We do it well enough to persist as a species, at least for now, but it's very likely that we are not tapping into that system as well as we could, and how would we know, if we don't know? It's one of those you who don't know what you don't knows. There's a beautiful experiment that explored when dopamine is released in the context of watching sport or watching comedy, believe it or not. And with the comedy stuff, it was every time there was a surprise, it was kind of that jarring like ha-ha, and they'd measure people's dopamine output. They were also brain imaging. In a game of basketball, it's a beautiful opportunity experimentally. Because every time one team gets the ball or is shooting free throws or something, they're going down court, and it's either going to end up in the basket, or it's not. Might end up on the free throw line, but it's end up or not. So what they found is that the schedule of anticipation was every time there was a switch of which team got it. So you're waiting, waiting, and then it's, ah. You're waiting, waiting. Yes. Waiting, waiting, three-pointer. Ah, awesome, and if something happened where it looked like they were going to make the three-pointer, but then somebody basically swatted the ball away, and then went for a half court shot, like you don't expect that very often, bigger dopamine release. So that's kind of how the dopamine thing works. When you describe wrestling, I wonder, because you don't know the script, it's not one team gets it, then the other team gets it. You don't know who's going to win. Anything could happen is what you said. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: The availability of that dopamine surge or drip, which is a powerful thing, is completely-- it's completely out of your reach in terms of anticipation. You don't know when it's going to come, but it must arrive often enough that you return to it 11 hours a week of watching. In many ways, the way I'm starting to conceptualize the creative process is a little bit the same. You don't know where those nuggets of gold and those loose threads are, but you have enough experience-- and in this case, I am referring to you specifically-- to know that they are in there. The people walking in this room have a certain level of ability and talent to create that the map will form itself, as we are going through the voyage. And those nuggets of-- here I'm calling them dopamine-- but they are out there, and that knowledge is enough to get you to come back again and again to trust the process. So I actually think the way you described wrestling as it's the energy of the sport. It's not whether or not it's this move or that move or who wins or who loses. It's the energy, and I'm guessing it's the energy that it creates in you as an observer. RICK RUBIN: Yes. It's the energy creates in me, and the reality that it's honest in what it is, in a world where seemingly nothing is honest at what it is. And again, not because people are lying all the time. We have little data, we make up a story to explain it, and then we say that's what happened. And we have trusted sources who do exactly what I just described and who pass this down as gospel of what we teach. And maybe it's true, and maybe it's not. With wrestling, we know, maybe it's true, maybe it's not. We lean towards it not being true, but what's really interesting about wrestling, and maybe one of the most fun things about it, is that, sometimes, real life works its way into the story. Like two wrestlers get married. Now-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: In real life. RICK RUBIN: Well, we don't know. It's like you never know. It's like in the storyline, they're getting married or getting divorced, or best friends turn on each other. And it could be part of the story, and it could really be happening, because they do. Right? Someone gets someone breaks their leg. So they're out, because their leg is broken. Did they break their leg? We don't know. They're out. Do you know what I'm saying? We're told they broke their leg. So there's always this like I wonder what's true? I wonder where the line is. We know that it's scripted and/or predetermined. That's how they say, it's predetermined. But we don't know where reality is and isn't, and in some ways, that's our real experience of the world, is this we don't really know where reality is and isn't. We have an idea, maybe. I think in some ways, wrestling's more honest or legitimate, because we start with the idea that it's fixed. When we go to a boxing match, we don't go to a boxing match thinking it's fixed. Yet, it might be, and historically, it's happened. Or there was just something in baseball where-- was it baseball? ANDREW HUBERMAN: I don't follow baseball. I should know. RICK RUBIN: It was just a big sports-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. RICK RUBIN: One of the teams that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: The plays, basically. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Was it the call signals of the-- RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Of the catcher? RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. You're not supposed to deprogram the-- or deconstruct the call signals of the other team, and I guess maybe a team got caught doing that. RICK RUBIN: Yes, and the team that won whatever the World Series was. So it's like, with wrestling, that wouldn't be a scandal. Do you know what I'm saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Almost anything goes. RICK RUBIN: Anything goes, and that's what the world is really like. So in some ways, it's comforting, and there's still this mystery of like, wow, I wonder if that's true or not, because we never really know. If someone gets hurt, did they really break their back, or are they just going on vacation? We don't know. We'll never know. It's fascinating. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It is fascinating, and I feel like there are certain people who show up in a way that is surprising in not just one direction but in all directions. Like it's one thing for a celebrity to come out and make a statement. That can be interesting or not interesting, depending on the celebrity and the statement and the delivery. And I'm probably going to get this wrong, because I'm terrible at pop culture things, most of them anyway. But as I recall, Lady Gaga showed up to some event wearing an outfit made of meat, and I can't tell you for the life of me whether or not that was a statement against meat or for meat. Maybe, it was a statement for the carnivore diet. Maybe, it was a statement for veganism. I don't know. RICK RUBIN: Or maybe neither. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Or maybe neither, but it was definitely a statement in that it broke with the norm. And it said to me, OK, she creates different rules for herself or breaks boundaries that other people had. I never heard of anyone doing that before. It doesn't mean they hadn't, but I never heard of anyone doing it before. But we do tend to associate outside the current playbook with, quote, unquote, creativity, unless it crosses a line, in which case, it becomes something else. It becomes almost theater for sake of theater. But what you're telling me is that, within the realm of wrestling, theater is the goal, at some level, and everybody knows it who goes into those arenas, who watches it. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Everybody. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And everyone agrees to kind of suspend outside reality and say this is reality. RICK RUBIN: Yes, and they boo for the bad guys and cheer for the good guys, knowing that backstage they're probably friends. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Except for the kids that are 11, who think it's really real. RICK RUBIN: I don't know. I don't even know if they know. I'm not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: The only other person I know who has vocalized their love of professional wrestling"}

So my PhD is in clinical psychology. And I did all my pre and post internships that dealt with stress and trauma. - Do you see patients or did you see patients at that time? - I did. Yes, I don't anymore. - Okay, that's a very unique constellation of practitioner and researcher. So what are the mindsets that you try and adopt on a regular basis in as a consequence or in relation to those things, sort of athlete, researcher, clinician? For yourself as you move through life, do you have an overarching mindset that all challenge's good, or do you have any kind of central mindsets that help you navigate through, you know, it was passed to be a pretty complex set of daily routines given everything that you juggle.

I don't think there's a obvious answer to your question other than the guiding light for me has been an undercurrent of understanding that our mindsets matter.

Any athlete knows that you can be the same physical being from one day to the next one moment to the next, and perform completely differently, just depending on what you're thinking. I was a gymnast growing up. And if you can't visualize, if you can't see something in your mind then you have no chance when you get up there on the balance beam, right? And also, my father was a martial artist, a teacher of meditation. So this kind of mind body work was baked into me from an early age. And I think what I've done recently, is to try to understand it scientifically, and more importantly, to figure out how can we do better with this, right? We're all talking about AI taking over the world, and technology this and all the personalized medicine that, and it's like, we have done so little, relatively, so little with the human resource, our human brains, that the potential for which is so great. And we've done almost nothing. Take the placebo effect, we know a lot about what it is. We've done almost nothing to leverage that in medicine consciously and deliberately. So, what keeps me going, what gets me through the hard times is just that burning question of, what is going on here and what more can I do with the power of my mind? - Well, I and millions of other people are so grateful that you do this work. It's so important and it's truly unique."}

is it you know a 5 to 10 minute hot shower then get under the blankets this kind of thing I mean this kind of um good old uh good old mom's advice kind of stuff isn't it interesting so I'll tell you what the protocol was um there was uh and actually this is quite interesting historically there were a number of sanitariums in the northeast of the United States back at that time of the century and um they were run by the Adventist Church and their their way of dealing with the pandemic was different they were not using drug medications they were using hydrotherapy and sunlight some of the things that we've been talking about here and there was a guy by the name of Wells Rubble who was the medical director of the uh New England sanitarium and he said let's just take a look and see what's going on here let's look at let's pull the 10 sanitariums in this area see what's gone on in terms of the way we treat the patients and then look at the published data from the the Army hospitals and there was a stark difference he divided into two sections the first phase of influenza is the early phase and and the major uh end point of that early phase was did they get pneumonia okay and then from pneumonia the second end point after that was the second phase and that was the question was did they die so where the sanitarium seem to do a much better job than in the Army hospitals was in that first phase they had one sixth of the people actually go to the pneumonia phase so what were they doing immediately they were doing hydrotherapy immediately they were doing uh which was basically increasing body temperature doing fever types of treatments getting them out into the sunlight you you can remember maybe in your mind's eye these photographs of these Army hospital or these Army Camps and the tents were outside because they didn't have any place to put them in some of these cases so the sunlight was good but the thing that they weren't doing was the hydrotherapy once they got to the pneumonia stage there was no difference between what the sanitariums were doing and the Army hospitals the mortality was 50% remember this is prior to penicillin this is 1918 this is before 1928 when we discovered penicillin so once you hit pneumonia it was really difficult to treat so he he actually wrote this up and I actually found it in a uh someone directed it to me they actually showed it to me it was in a um it wasn't even in a scientific journal that he published it it was some sort of periodical called life and health May 1st 1919 still remember in my head and he says hey this is what we did this is what they did they had one sixth of the mortal it in their uh in their institution and this was repeated multiple times this is not done in isolation there let's lead you up to the to the big thing here there was a Nobel Prize that was given for this in 1927 Jules Wagner yor was a Austrian psychiatrist who noticed that in his uh patients that had neuros syphilis that when they had a fever their symptoms improved so this is again prior to penicillin he actually took patients with malaria and he took the blood from these patients and carefully infected his neurosyphilis patients with malaria and of course you know that malaria causes very very high fevers he cured neurosyphilis by causing fevers from malaria wild um and all he really had to do was heat them up um there was many ways of doing it at the time he closets sometimes they would inject foreign proteins to create a fever this was another way of doing it with malaria of course at the time they had the treatment for malaria right um quinine well and LPS will do this yes right LPS as you mentioned is lipid polysaccharide I think they get it from um yeast cell wall or something and um it's a foreign antigen yeah it's a contaminant in a lot of gray Market peptides and things that I suggest people don't take you know there are a lot of people now who are interested in peptides and they buy them on the gray market and it says not for human or uh animal use research purposes only and people often say well why not use those you know why do people have to go through a physician and a compounding pharmacy if they're going to explore that territory at all yeah and the reason is there it's very clear that most of the gry market peptides have LPS um in them so small amounts but injected repeatedly over time people start getting the systemic inflammation and fever response there you go um you that's it's a little bit of a tangent but it gets to the same mechanism yeah uh so

{"question": "Why do the brain regions responsible for defensive behaviors and fear seem to be closely positioned and intermingled with those responsible for aggression, and how does this arrangement facilitate the inhibition of aggression by fear?", "doc_id": "uxZFl4BDOGk_8", "video_id": "uxZFl4BDOGk", "video_title": "Dr. David Anderson: The Biology of Aggression, Mating, & Arousal | Huberman Lab Podcast #89", "video_header": "Evolution & Development of Defensive vs. Offensive Behaviors, Fear", "segment_idx": "8", "time_start": "29:25", "time_end": "35:34", "context": "- Mm-hmm. - And of course, we don't know, because we weren't consulted at the design phase. But why do you think there would be such a close positioning of neurons that can elicit such divergent states and behaviors? I mean, you're talking about this pear-shaped structure, where the neurons that generate fear are cheek to jowl with the neurons that generate offensive aggression of all things. It's like putting the neurons that control swallowing next to the neurons that control vomiting, it just seems to me that, on the one hand, this is the way that neural circuits are often arranged, and yet, to me, it's always been perplexing as to why this would be the case. - Yeah, I think that is a very profound question, and I've wondered about that a lot. If you think from an evolutionary perspective, it might have been the case that defensive behaviors and fear arose before offensive aggression, because animals, first and foremost, have to defend themselves from predation by other animals. And maybe it's only when they're comfortable with having warded off predation and made themselves safe, that they can start to think about, \"Who's going to be the alpha male in my group here?\" And so it could be that if you think that brain regions and cell populations evolve by duplication and modification of preexisting cell populations, that might be the way that those regions wound up next to each other. And developmentally, they start out from a common pool of precursors that expresses the same gene, the fear neurons and the aggression neurons, and then with development, it gets shut off in the aggression neurons and maintained in the fear neurons. Now, that view says, \"Oh, it's an accident of evolution and development,\" but I think there must be a functional part as well. So one thing we know about offensive aggression is that strong fear shuts it down, whereas defensive aggression, at least in rats, is actually enhanced by fear. It's one of the big differences between defensive aggression and offensive aggression. And if you think about it, if offensive aggression is rewarding and pleasurable, if you start to get really scared, that tends to take the fun out of it, and maybe these two regions are close to each other to facilitate inhibition of aggression by the fear neurons. We know for a fact that if we deliberately stimulate those fear neurons at the top of the pear, when two animals are involved in a fight, it just stops the fight dead in its tracks and they go off into the corner and freeze. So at least hierarchically, it seems like fear is the dominant behavior over offensive aggression, and how that inhibition would work is not clear, 'cause all these neurons are pretty much excitatory, they're almost all glutamatergic. And so one of the interesting questions for the future is, how exactly does fear dominate over and shut down offensive aggression in the brain? How does that work, is it all circuitry, are there chemicals involved? What's the mechanism and when is it called into play? But I think that's the way I tend to think about why these neurons are all mixed up together. And it's not just fight and freezing, or fight and flight, there are also metabolic neurons that are mixed together in VMH as well. - Mm-hmm. Controlling body-wide metabolism? - Yeah. - Very interesting. - There are neurons there that respond to glucose, when glucose goes up in your bloodstream, they're activated, and VMH has a whole history in the field of obesity, because if you destroy it in a rat, you get a fat rat. So the way most of the world thinks about VMH is they think about, \"Oh, that's the thing that keeps you from getting fat.\" It's the anti-obesity area, but in the area of social behavior, we see it as a center for control of aggression and fear behaviors. And again, why these neurons and these functions, I like to call them the four Fs, feeding, freezing, fighting and mating. - Mm-hmm. - That they all seem to be closely intermingled with each other, maybe because crosstalk between them is very important to help the animal's brain decide what behavior to prioritize and what behavior to shut down at any given moment. - One of the things that we will do is link to the incredible videos of these mice that have selective stimulation of neurons in the VMH, Dayu's and the other studies that you've done. Whenever I teach, I show those videos at some point, with the caveats and warnings that are required when one is about to see a video of a mouse trying to mate with another mouse, or mating with another mouse, and they seem both to be quite happy about the mating experience, at least as far as we know, as observers of mice. And then upon stimulation of those VMH neurons, one of the mice essentially tries to kill the other mouse. And then when that stimulation is stopped, they basically go back to hanging out. They don't go right back to mating. - Right. - There's some reconciliation clearly that needs to happen first, we assume. - Yes. - But it's just so striking, and I think equally striking is the video where the mouse is alone in there with the glove, the VMH neurons are stimulated and the mouse goes into a rage, it looks like it wants to kill the glove, basically. - Yep. - So striking, I encourage people to go watch those, because it really puts a tremendous amount of color on what we're describing, and it's just the idea that there are switches in the brain, to me, really became clear upon seeing that. One of the, excuse me, one of the concepts"}
{"question": "What is the role of dopamine in motivating us to take action towards something we desire, and how does it differ from its role in giving us pleasure?", "doc_id": "vA50EK70whE_7", "video_id": "vA50EK70whE", "video_title": "How to Increase Motivation & Drive", "video_header": "Motivation= Pleasure Plus Pain", "segment_idx": "7", "time_start": "12:11", "time_end": "14:07", "context": "which is that motivation is a two-part process which is about balancing pleasure and pain. Okay. Most people think about motivation and reward and dopamine is just trying to achieve pleasure. And indeed dopamine is released in the brain from the VTA at the* nucleus accumbens. When we experience things that we like. So here's the way to conceptualize this and if you can internalize this in your mind it will really help you as you move through your day trying to understand why you might be motivated or not motivated for certain things. So when you're just sitting around, not doing much of anything, maybe you wake up in bed in the morning. You're thinking about getting up or not. This reward pathway is releasing dopamine at a rate of about three or four times per second. It's kind of firing in a low level. When I say firing me an electrical activity in the neurons. So when you're just around, you feel okay, not depressed not highly motivated, not excited maybe three or four times a second. If suddenly you get excited about something you anticipate something, not receive an award but you get excited in an anticipatory way. Then the rate of firing the rate of activity in this reward pathway suddenly increases to like 30 or 40 times and it has the effect of creating a sense of action or desire to move in the direction of the thing that you're craving. In fact, it's fair to say that dopamine is responsible for wanting and for craving, and that's distinctly different from the way that you hear it talked about normally which is that it's involved in pleasure. So yes, dopamine is released in response to sex. It's released in response to food. It's released in response to a lot of things but it's mostly released in anticipation and craving for a particular thing. It has the effect of narrowing our focus for the thing that we crave and that thing could be as simple as a cup of coffee. It could be as important as a big board meeting. It could be a big, final exam. It could be a, the person that we're excited to meet or see dopamine doesn't care about what you're craving."}

and I think it used to be linked to you know stereotypes that are no longer true I think the challenge with tattoos is to things making sure that what is being placed underneath the skin is not an allergen we see this mostly with Reds that use cinemates they produce a lot of granulomatous reactions or foreign body reactions one making sure obviously they're using Clean safe equipment that's sterile you know you don't want the bloodborne pathogens the real challenge is surveying for growths in patients who have a lot of tattoos it's hard to see small skin cancers form or changes and moles because usually the tattoos are of dark color so the surveillance part becomes a little bit more challenging so if you have a lot of tattoos just make sure to see your dermatologist and somebody who feels comfortable and confident in screening um but other than that no they're they've been around for hundreds and hundreds of years and I think they're fine if done correctly that's a good segue into surveying for skin cancers earlier you talked about some of the more common forms of skin cancer um Squam cell carcinoma basil cell carcinoma but then there's the the one no one truly wants which is um melanoma melanoma yeah so I was taught to keep it eye on my moles yeah if they change change in Border change in size Etc uh to notify a dermatologist um I get my moles checked about I don't know I just had it done less than a year ago um but what about getting all skin checked I mean what do you this is your area of expertise so so if you had a magic wand yeah um to help prevent skin cancers what would what would you have people do that's a great great question so obviously there are many forms of skin cancer but the three most common like we talked about basil cell carcinoma squa cell carcinoma and melanoma there are other types like Merkel cell and Etc but they're far less common now historically melanoma has been our number one killer for skin cancer until about a few years ago around 2018 when the Nobel Prize was won for the new drugs that treated melanoma this year we expect three times as many deaths in the United States from sell carcinoma than we do melanoma but nobody talks about that we lose a patient every about 62 minutes to melanoma but one every 37 minutes to Sasol carcinoma first and foremost the thing that you want to look for in terms of skin cancer risk and predisposition is look at family history your family history in your genetics plays the largest role in predisposition for skin cancer development if you can gather a family history you can understand your risk in developing it and it can help dictate your screening now if you can't get a family history or you don't know your family history not a problem generally we recommend an annual skin exam by a good reputable board certified dermatologist and that includes every square inch of your skin including you know your hair between your toes in the genital area we can develop a skin cancer anywhere Bob Marley died of a melanoma on his toenail that was thought to be a soccer injury you know Jimmy Buffett died of a Merkel cell carcinoma one of these rare types that occur in Sun exposed areas anybody can get them obviously there's predispositions in higher risk populations but it's such an easy non-invasive exam to do that everybody should get one at least once a year the other reason why I bring this up is skin cancers can develop in Sun protected areas one of the areas that I see a rapid increase in skin cancer development is in genital areas as and in the mouth due to HPV and we see this a lot in younger and younger patients probably in the last month I've operated on six or seven young patients under the age of 40 with sisol carcinomas caused by HPV in the genital region this is obviously not Sun driven it's not something you can put sunscreen or take a you know product to protect you from but it's something that's easily monitored or surveyed so I would say at the very minimum get a family history or a personal history get an annual surveillance exam if you have a lot of moles I used to direct the pigmented lesions and melanoma clinic this is something that was really hard for a lot of dermatologists and patients to follow when they when they're covered with moles see which one is changing there are tools that can be utilized including whole body photography mole mapping and some new AI based softwares that basically track the moles and look for changes as you feed the software more and more pictures from the patients it's fascinating a lot of the stuff is developing from our our well I should say my alma moer but up at Stamford is these AI based um software apps that allow us to survey some of the most challenging patients so if you have a lot of moles your screening may be more than once a year if you have a lot of moles you inherently have a slightly increased risk for melanoma now we always use these terms interchangeably melanoma skin cancer basil squamous Etc importantly to know for every one melanoma there's 10 non-melanoma skin cancers that's namely basil cell and squa cell about 5 million Americans will be diagnosed with one of the non- melanomas this year alone five million 5 million it's a big number yeah it's about one in four uh one in four Americans at some point in their lifetime will develop a skin cancer encroaching one in three Americans by the end of their by the end of 2030 so it's a lot majority of these are not life-threatening but they're functionally and cosmetically disfiguring they arise on sun exposed areas so surveillance is really important for the HPV that eventually becomes"}

psychoactive effects others perhaps have not how could we describe for both groups um what the quote unquote psychoactive effects are you mentioned um the higher the concentration of THC the quote unquote higher someone will get right the greater the intensity of the High um what is the high um and I know people are probably chuckling saying you know does huberman not know because he's never done it I mean that's my own business I I just want people to understand what you mean by psychoactive effects so I mean the way that people would usually describe the the intoxicating effects of cannabis is uh they would I mean people often refer to it as there being some Euphoria or some positive mood not on the same order as what people would describe with say cocaine or some other stimulants but there certainly is some kind of positive aspect I mean if there wasn't people wouldn't be using it if they didn't feel positive about it afterwards uh there can be you know other aspects uh in terms of changes in feeding Behavior people might find things funnier than they found things it might change the way they perceive various environmental stimuli um but it can also for some people create a bit of a dissociative state to some some degree where people might feel a little bit out of body so it's kind of a a complicated intoxicating state to describe I would say because usually if someone's referring to something like a stimulant they're just like oh people feel like they're God they're like you know possibility everywhere yeah exactly like they're very happy and they're kind of jacked up and I think with cannabis the way people would describe it would be very different it's like kind of an introspective State you might be more aware of your bodily feelings and um states that are going on inside you you're kind of internal state but you also have like a different perspective on external stimuli you might process information a bit differently focus on things a bit differently so it's kind of a a complicated state to describe I would say usually when people are assessing if someone's intoxicated like um the kind of lab work where people get some on high they just kind of use a what we call a visual analog scale which is like a one to 100 or something or zero to 100 and say do you feel high do you enjoy this would you say you feel euphoric is your mood elevated so they're kind of scaling things like that so I think that's more typically in a lab setting how you would Define if someone's high or not from it and this is why when people do studies with something like a placebo cannabis or a very low THC cannabis you'll see kind of a scaling so um even if you give someone a placebo cannabis if they think that they're getting cannabis a lot of people still respond by saying they feel a bit High that's interesting is that true even if they've never used cannabis before I'm not actually certain if you are allowed to have someone in a drug study if they've never done something before I think they have to have had some previous experience with a drug be ened now smokers everywhere running to look at subject but I think yeah I don't think you can use drug naive people I mean I don't run human clinical lab studies so I can't explicitly say it but that's my understanding is that someone has to have had even limited like you know not much but at least once or twice they have to have experienced the drug before so I don't know if you would take someone who was completely blind cuz I don't know how they would replicate that state if they're not expecting it what about the effects of cannabis on time perception you know there's this um reputation that cannabis has uh for disrupting time perception that people will think a long period of time has passed when in fact very little time has passed maybe it's sometimes even the reverse um is the mechanism by which cannabis can adjust time perception known I wouldn't say it's well worked out there definitely seems to be some like temporal d like you're saying where people think things have you know someone will be high and someone will ask them how long do you think time has passed they would report usually longer periods of time have passed than I actually have I feel like there is some older work I could dig up to see if I could find that is either in like it might even be in pigeons uh but it might be in rodents it's looking at like temporal ordering and they give animals cannaboids and that's kind of a cleaner way of seeing because they are very good at learning like if I wait 10 minutes and then I engage in a behavior I get a reward and so you you can really train animals to have this ordinal timing where they kind of know distinct periods of time and if they give them canabo they respond differently so it in that context it does still seem to produce some state where there's a an altered perception of time passing and so I think if we were going to really understand the mechanism of it that would probably be the way to go but I'm not super familiar with the work because no one's I mean anything I can think of is pretty old I can't think of anything modern where people have actually looked"}

really brilliant work creating practices where when one is not feeling what they want to feel um you know there's this kind of question like are you supposed to feel your feelings or are you supposed to create new feelings in place of them especially if they're unpleasant it's it's like there's no clear answer to that because it's complicated infinite number of variables but she does have this interesting practice whereby it's it's a bit like a meditation where if you're struggling with something like maybe you're struggling with boredom or not knowing where to go with your life or you're not happy or you just feel some underlying anxiety to think back to a time when you felt particularly blank like a time when you felt particularly empowered or particularly curious um it could be very specific particularly um amused because and the idea is that in anchoring to the emotion State first you call to mind a bunch of potential action steps and the reason I like this um approach is that that is at least one way that quote unquote the brain works which is that the emotion states are linked to a bunch of action step possibilities kind of like a magic Library where if you go into the room called sadness there are a bunch of action steps associated with that go beyond crying it's like curling up in the fetal position Etc you go into the room that's called um Advent you know excitement and and there's all this idea about getting in vehicles and going places and things of that sort so what you're talking about is I believe thinking about the emotional states of others and then from there I think this is where you're going to go cultivating some action steps that you can take to ensure that that future generation can access those emotions yes but with a slight correction because it's not about thinking about their future emotional states it's actually feeling them I see so it's not saying I want my kids to be happy I want them to Fe I want them to have no trauma it's um it's feeling what it would be to have to be happy no trauma yes right because that becomes like that becomes an anchor right that this she's 100% correct what it does is but it places it it's like a cat anchor so if you and I were sailor which we're not we would there's a thing called a CED anchor and a CJ anchor is this anchor that you throw you know 30 40 meters off to the side it hits the bottom and you use the rope to pull yourself there emotions will pull us towards those Futures it will alter the behaviors so time and time again when we intellectualize and we become overly cognitive in terms of Futures that we want to see happen for ourselves future Ari or or future wallik family or future Society or future civil Global planetary civilization if we think about it that's one thing but to actually execute on those goals we have to actually connect the emotional state that we want to be in to drive that function remember look this is one of the things that Marty Selman says that that Freud got it wrong Freud felt as Marty says that emotions were these things that we that happened in the past that we would use to dwell on and that was neurosis and anxiety and depression no no no no emotions are there to help us make better decisions for the future we are future oriented mammals and species so what emotions do it's not meant to be like oh you know I I had this like terrible breakup I feel so terrible uh then I'm going to go to my therapist I'm going to talk about all that stuff that happened in the past that's one way of looking at the other way is your body is telling you in a very very visceral way whatever you just did to that had you in that situation don't do it again because if you do you're going to feel a certain way you know they did this study where they at at a college campus they they found people who had just been in a kind of a quasi longterm relationship that had gone through a breakup quasi long-term fine what I've learned what I've learned in life is it's important to define the relationship it was about six months um and people had gone to the breakup they they gave they gave you know one group of placebo and another group actually just got aaminin got Tylenol and the group that got the acetaminophen actually felt better why because those because em we actually feel emotions we actually feel pain that some of the same circuits are being tripped and so that says to me that emotions are there to guide future action so we can have pro-social emotions awe and empathy and compassion and this this's one we call love

generative Drive well it's great that that works for you what what you're saying is that that for you like you can prime your generative drive that way right and then you prime it you prime the pump it gets revved up right like and then and then you know it's it's really manifesting itself inside of you I mean there's many different manifestations of the generative drive as there are people right so some things are going to work for some person other things are going to work for a different person right but but but you're saying that hey I know this thing works for me and even though sometimes it's not easy to do I do it and then look what it gets for me right and that's that's really healthy right it's like knowing that this thing works for you and then you become committed to it because your generative Drive is is is really strongly supported by it right and then you have this sense of Good Feeling right so then you have you have the peace and you have the you just the overall sense of goodness right the you know peace and contentment and Delight you're getting that in learning and in teaching so so you you're figuring out like hey this works for me right and again you don't have to figure it out through this lens it's if we find parts that aren't working then we go back and we figure them out right maybe a good example maybe is um so let's say you take someone who who really enjoys gardening and gets something out of gardening right so there are as many generative drives and how they're measured out as there are humans but there can be common outcomes of them right so the enjoyment of of fostering plants growing a garden is like that's not uncommon in humans right so imagine someone who hasn't been doing that right they really want to they have a drive to do it there's a plot of land in the back that they used to cultivate right so if they're not doing it there any number of reasons maybe maybe they were depressed and they needed mental health treatment maybe they just got away from the path that they were on maybe their defenses shifted a little bit whatever the case may be they go back to the pillars and they figure it out right and now they're in accord with themselves right and they're living through agency and gratitude and they feel like right I can go back out there and I can till that land I can you know I can get the hoe out I can you know I can make the plots I'm going to put the seeds in I'm going to nurture like I can go do that and I can do it even what even though I was depressed even though somebody assaulted me five months ago you know even though I lost my job even though even though even though right they overcome the even those right and the sense of agency tells them right I can go do that right and the sense of gratitude no one who's miserable and and and now is you know is in such an awful position about life because they were attacked or lost their job or something bad happened whatever it may be or they're lost in cynicism there's no gratitude there right it's a gratitude for being in life for having the capability of going back and and you and planting seeds in that Garden that's the alliance between agency and gratitude and then the person goes and does that right so think of what's going on there they do this thing they feel good about this thing they can have they can look out at the Garden feel some peace right feel some contentment to them be delighted by what they did remember how much they loved it before how much it means to them so yes that goodness comes that goodness suffuses us and it raises up the generative drive that says right it's it's good we breathe some life into it right enough to get that Garden done now the generative Drive is further fostered forward by the goodness the person feels so so the example and the difference between the person who's like wants a garden feels terrible about themselves and they're not doing it and they feels lousy every time they look out the window and there they are looking out the window right the difference between that and having made a garden and looking out the window at it is a night and day difference and the the the person who's looking out the window with the garden that they built overcoming whatever was inside of them because they they went and addressed it and and prove to themselves that they could that's what we're after in life right it's we all know this it doesn't look like somebody levitating at the top of a mountain right that's what it looks like the person looking out the window at the Garden and thinking about what they overc overcame to create the garden and seeing the goodness of it all yeah I'm glad you said the word creating because it seems It's about creating things real tangible things but that the process to get there is every bit as important as what's created when you create knowledge that that's tangible right like you you you create knowledge maybe that that person looks down the row of beautiful flowers and has the same sense of goodness inside of them that you do when you're well like right I just I just went and learned something as you described that I I'm thinking I I certainly hope so because for me it's it's an incredible sense of satisfaction and and um one that I enjoy so much that I almost don't want to look at it too much cuz to me it it sits in this um uh rare domain of perfect like it's just it just feels so good and um and that I can get back there is very is very comforting to me right and that's all of this that it feels so good that's what all this is It's the generative drive right it's the it's the Gratitude right it's the contentment it's like all that coming together and it's interesting we could contrast that to to when you talked about a repeated cycle that's negative right then you're not feeling that right so so think about the learning that can come from it right that you you can you can achieve this and feel this and be in this state in one aspect of your life like what can you learn from that to bring to the other place and more yes that's important it's more it's often starting with what's going on in the place that's not doing well right like I said why the repetition right so this is how we we can have what we're seeking in parts of our Lives even if we don't in others but if we can have it in parts of our Lives we can have it in others too and we can become role models for ourselves we can learn from ourselves eles we can learn from what brings the good to how to raise up the things that about us in our lives that aren't there yet I often get the question H from the"}

First of all, I want to say that your book Never Split the Difference. One of my favorite books. Chris Voss: Thank you. Andrew Huberman: I don't say that lightly. I don't endorse books very often, but the books I do endorse, I love, love, love. I also have to say that it's a toss up between your book \"Never Split the Difference,\" and \"The Body Keeps the Score\" for the award for best titles of any book. Those are just like amazing titles. Amazing titles. Chris Voss: Tahl Raz, our cowriter, came up with a title. Andrew Huberman: Yeah, it's a phenomenal title, that, and \"The Body Keeps the Score\" because there's so much contained in the title and then the book exceeds expectations. So really amazing book. People should listen to it, read it if they haven't already. But you're doing a lot more right now than just writing. Although I want to hear about your other book projects as well. But before you list off the number of things that you're doing, tell me first about Fireside, because this sounds like a really interesting endeavor that frankly, I haven't heard of before. What's Fireside? Chris Voss: Brand new social media platform. It's essentially an interactive podcast. It's a subscription service founded by Falon Fatemi and Mark Cuban. Falon and I have been friends for a number of years. She was Google's youngest employee. She's an entrepreneur, dynamic, smart, hard-charging person. And it's sort of grew out of what's inadequate in some of the social media apps that are out there trying to combine the best ideas of a few different things. And Falon suggested it to me and I thought I'll jump in because she's a visionary. And what it's turned out to be is it's effectively weekly interactive group coaching. And you get the app off your iPhone or your Android, whatever platform your phone is on, and then you log in, we do an hour once a week and you're getting group coaching and then you get to ask questions and it's got a video component to it. So if you want to ask a question, we're going to bring you up on, quote, stage. And I get to see you and talk directly to you. And you get to see me and talk directly to me. Or I interviewed Mark Cuban a couple of weeks ago and people got to come on and ask Mark questions or ask me questions. And what it has turned out to be is it's one of sort of the next level of how to get better at negotiations. After you've read the book and probably taken the master class, where do you go next? One of the people that came on the podcast the other day, the Fireside episode, they said, well, I don't have enough money yet to go to your in-person training events because those are expensive and this is how I'm going to get better in a meantime and work my way in that direction. And so the monthly coaching, if you were to sign up for group coaching from us on a regular basis, on a monthly basis, it would probably easily cost you for what we're providing 25, 30 thousand a month, and this is a thousand a year. So at scale, it's an opportunity to interact directly with me and the members on my team once a week and get group coaching. And it's just kind of fun. We're getting a kick out of it and people that really care about interacting well with people. Guy comes on the first episode I did and he said, besides the fact that you helped me make a lot more money, you helped me save my marriage. And he just needed to know how to talk more genuinely and honestly with his wife in a way that made her felt heard, and he didn't really have a good way to do that beforehand. And I was just like, that's a lot. I don't know how to respond to that other than just be grateful that people can say stuff like that to us. So the Fireside thing is kind of cool. We're still experimenting with it. It's an interactive podcast, group coaching. It's fun. Andrew Huberman: Great. I mean, I would say changing lives there. I mean, the saving a marriage is no small deal. And I think that the ability to communicate directly with people also, I imagine, gives them the opportunity to implement the tools that you're providing in real time. It's one thing to hear about something and try it, but then you can get feedback in real time. Are you on these Fireside chats directly or members of your team? Chris Voss: No, we do one every week, and I'm once a month. And the other thing, too. Like, I can explain something one way, and if for whatever reason, it doesn't land in your context, you can't quite get it. So that's what we found about the interactive nature of it. Somebody comes on and asks a question in their context, and then I'll answer it, and then they'll go like, oh, okay, all right, that helped. So you get to hear people like you who are struggling with it the way you are, but I haven't put it in your context yet. And that's the other thing that's great about a Q and A. A live Q and A. Andrew Huberman: We had a guest on here who told me that there are amazing data supporting the fact that people follow the medical and health advice of doctors that they can relate to far more than they follow the medical and health advice of physicians that they feel aren't like them. And oftentimes this can include the physician or healthcare provider being someone that they would aspire to be like. But oftentimes it's just some common rapport. Like, they both like baseball, or they both like to cook or to garden, and that sets a bridge where then the patient is willing to do all these things that ordinarily they would be resistant to. Chris Voss: Right. Andrew Huberman: And there are really good data to support this. And that really stuck with me because it says that it's not just about the information or the delivery route of the information, that the context and the rapport is even along something as like, oh, by the way, I'm not a major sports fan on most things, but like, oh, you're a Bills fan or something, like me too. Like, that can be the difference between somebody doing all the things to lower their blood pressure, the day-in changing their diet, all those things versus not making the changes at all. Chris Voss: Rapport is a magic. Yeah, it's kind of a magic component that changes everything. Andrew Huberman: Well, Fireside sounds like a great opportunity for people to not just ask questions, but to build rapport with you and members of your team. So I'm going to check it out. Lord knows I need help improving my communications in certain domains of life. Believe me, I get the memos. Fact, what other writing projects are you involved in, if any? Chris Voss: We've been toying with this companion operations manual for tactical empathy, which getting it right is important. So it's sort of a companion book to \"Never Split the Difference.\" That's probably at least a year and a half out from being done. So in the meantime, we do a lot of online training. We got a newsletter we put out weekly for people to get our latest cutting-edge application. Thoughts as much as possible. We're putting information out that we charge for a lot, and we put out a lot of free, you know. I'm throwing out ideas on Instagram, but we're constantly trying to put information out there so that people can collaborate better. So specific. We just finished a book for residential real estate agents. A friend of mine, Steve Scholl, we put that out last November. That's sort of niched, but it's mostly the Black Swan method for real estate agents because every conversation they're in is a difficult, emotional conversation. Sale of a house is one of the most stressful moments of anybody's life, selling or buying, so we just put that out. In the meantime, we're spreading the gospel as much as possible. Andrew Huberman: We'll certainly point out the various places people can find you and the different venues for learning more. I want to say that numerous times throughout today's conversation, you"}
{"question": "What is the typical conversion rate from a gram of magic mushrooms to milligrams of psilocybin, and how does this relate to the concept of microdosing versus macrodosing?", "doc_id": "fcxjwA4C4Cw_5", "video_id": "fcxjwA4C4Cw", "video_title": "Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: The Science of Psychedelics for Mental Health | Huberman Lab Podcast", "video_header": "Microdosing", "segment_idx": "5", "time_start": "17:40", "time_end": "26:03", "context": "As you mentioned, the principal hallucinatory psychedelic agent in magic mushrooms. I'd like to start with a kind of nuts and bolts question just so that everyone's on the same page. I've read the papers that you've published and that others have published in this area. And typically, the dosages used in these trials are 25 milligrams of psilocybin. And we talk about one recent trial, in particular, that compared 25 to 10 milligrams to more frequent use of very small amounts. 1 milligram over 3 weeks, for instance. However, when people talk about magic mushrooms, they often talk about gram doses of the mushroom, because I'm assuming that they contain milligram dosages of psilocybin. Here, we're not encouraging use of any kind. These are clinical trials. But for clarity of understanding, what is the conversion, typically? Like 1 gram of magic mushrooms will contain how many milligrams of psilocybin on average. Because what I'm trying to do here is calibrate people to this idea of microdosing versus macrodosing. And that's fairly straightforward to do with respect to the clinical trials. But then in a lot of the lay discussion around this, you hear about heroic doses versus microdoses. And so I think there's a lot of confusion. So if you would, educate us on this idea of what's a microdose. And perhaps, also how many milligrams of psilocybin are contained in a gram of quote unquote, \"magic mushrooms?\" ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Sure. Well, a microdose is neither of these are that. Simple. But they're fun. It's a fun challenge. But microdose, one definition is that it's a dose of typically a classic psychedelic like LSD or psilocybin that has some perceptible psychedelic effects. It doesn't put you into a noticeable altered state of consciousness that feels like you're tripping. And if that was LSD, it looks as though the threshold is around about, let's see, 10, 11, 12 micrograms. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Micrograms. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Micrograms. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Want to be very clear here. Micrograms. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So 10 micrograms of LSD, are you saying will not induce visual hallucinations in most people? ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: So that's threshold level. That's about the level that some people who are sensitive could feel it. But if you were to talk to the microdosing gurus, they might say that that's the ballpark for an LSD dose that you would consider a micro dose, and then you would take semi-regularly. It's typically something like one day on, one day off or one day on, two days off. This kind of thing. There's different protocols. And yeah. So some like Jim Fadiman-- one of the popularizers of microdosing, I think would say that a true microdose should be sub-perceptible. You shouldn't feel it, yet the assumption is it's going to change you in some way on a kind of trait level more than a state level, and maybe behaviorally. And the typical story goes, it will improve well-being. And maybe, maybe, it could improve certain aspects of cognition, say, related to creative thinking. I emphasize the maybe there because that's another angle with microdosing. We're waiting for some compelling evidence. As things stand right now, I'd say, we lack that compelling evidence. There's some suggestive stuff, but often the study designs aren't that strong. It's really hard to do a study with microdosing, because you need to have permission to give people a microdose that for practical reasons, they would go home with, otherwise, you're requiring them to be in the lab, say three times a week for x number of weeks to meet the criteria of a course of microdosing, which might be two or three times a week for say, a month. And that's a hard thing to do in a lab study. It's expensive. You'd need to do that against a suitable control, so a placebo control. And there is a study that's been done in New Zealand that has some interesting preliminary data that did-- I think did the design right. But it hasn't been published yet. I've seen some positive findings presented around improvements in mood. But it's a bit early to get too excited about that. It needs to go through peer review and all that. But as things stand, the evidence is pretty thin. And we have to be honest about that. We did quite a creative study with my colleagues at Imperial. The guy leading that, Balazs Szigeti, a Hungarian chap, did a really creative design. Very much his brainchild. He instructed people to do their own blinding, their own placebo-controlled blinding of their own microdosing. So this was a classic citizen science study like do it yourself science where they would get their LSD tabs and chop them up, put them into gel capsules, opaque, and have other capsules that are the placebos that they just close empty capsule. And then there was a whole barcode scan technique so that you kind of shuffle them up. But they've got the barcode in, the QR code. So you can break the code later on, but once you've shuffled them up, you no longer know which ones had the microdosing and which ones are empty. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Was this LSD? ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: This was LSD. Also tried it with mushrooms, but the issues with the mushrooms was people would burp sometimes. They'd belch. And then they'd have this mushroom taste. So then he instructed people to get some non-psychoactive mushroom material to put in. So it's really-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not an easy study. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: --not an easy study. And it was-- I love that kind of science. Real creative first mover kind of science. And the results were fascinating, because the short story is that the microdosing didn't compellingly beat the placebo. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It did not. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: It didn't. And he controlled, because he asked. He controlled for expectancy. So people's positive expectancy, which is, in a sense, the vehicle that carries the placebo response. It's why you have a placebo. Is that positive expectancy can drive a therapeutic effect to a large extent. So you measured that pre-trial and then used it to correct for the response. And how did it work? Those who got a placebo but thought they got a microdose did as well as those who thought they got a microdose and did get a microdose. So it was the bigger effect-- the majority of the effect was in thinking that you got a microdose. So in a sense, it was a victory for the power of the placebo response. And it's created all sorts of controversy. People don't want to believe it, that kind of thing. But that's the beauty of science, isn't it? That science is not about what you want to believe. That right there is the beauty of science. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love that experiment. Kudos to them. I'm not going to attempt to say his last name correctly. ROBIN CARHART-HARRIS: I tried. Yeah. Probably you made a mess of it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. No. I think you got it."}

es schic attack I don't want Hemorrhage I don't want any of this stuff and we already discussed a little bit about how what's good for your heart generally is good for the brain but you know I think most people strive to eat well meaning not excessively also not undereat um to hopefully eat a lot of unprocessed or minimally processed foods and to avoid smoking perhaps um avoid alcohol in excess avoid hard drugs um get exercise um and so you know I think people generally try and do all these things get good sleep Etc um but at some level I think everyone also wants to know like when are they in their safest um kind of shape for avoiding a stroke is is there sort of a blood pressure cut off where we could say okay you know if you keep your blood pressure resting blood pressure below blank you're doing pretty well um and if your cholesterol is below blank you're doing pretty well and then you just you know while keeping moderation uh in mind try and live a life that um you know reduces the probability of getting a stroke or a or some other you know blood related neural attack well I think it has to be individualized to some extent and um over time the standards and the guidelines have changed it used to be if you're systolic blood pressure that's the upper number was under 130 130 or under that was considered normal and and would not lead to problems now the guidelin suggests that 120 or lower is better in large you know studies but um as an example uh when my blood pressure gets under 120 I feel lightheaded in fact I had an event uh about 15 years ago when I was overdoing it like I shouldn't have been overdoing exercise overing everything I was in my I was Stanford faculty member that over that was a joke that among Stanford faculty I was 56 and I operated all day in two operating rooms um I got done early um it was in the spring and I took a run up to the dish and then I took a red eye to Houston for a meeting and I emailed on the flight got an hour or two asleep went to the meeting was fine uh it was a stroke meeting with a bunch of scientists uh neurologists and scientists there were about 120 people there were two neurosurgeons there plus me and um drank some coffee at noon I went for a run cuz I like running and in hu at that day in Houston it was um 90° and 85% humidity and got back had a glass of um tea went back to the meeting had some more coffee and then as the afternoon session opened up I started to feel lightheaded and um next thing I know I'm looking up at the chandelier and they're they're they're shouting um stroke Cardiac Arrest seizure and they're starting to pump on my chest so they rushed me to the hospital where I had uh a simultaneous workup for cardiac arrest and stroke and after um I'll make the story short after uh a $100,000 workup it was determined I had a faint because I was overdoing it so since then I now I try to get seven to eight hours sleep at night that's clearly the Bedrock of health so I increased I used to get three to five hours sleep at night now I get 7 to nine if I can do it uh cut back on on on coffee on caffeine and um uh I don't push myself to exercise like I used to I'm feeling a fatigued I'm on an anti-hypertensive agent but I actually don't take it every day because um for me it's better to have a pressure 125 to 135 and it's true for some of my patients if you've got some disease in your arteries you may not want to have such a low blood pressure so I would individualize it but in general um you want to take care of your body like I've learned and probably maybe you've learned over time I'm learning I mean this is very interesting I've I tend to have low blood pressure it s of runs in my family to have low blood pressure um I can definitely relate to the um hard driving um ambition phenotype I think it's it's worth people hearing this because it's characteristic of a lot of people in high-intensity professions and I made the joke about Stanford faculty but um it's true I think that if you're ambitious you tend to overdo a bit more that's something I'm certainly working on and I've um run a very busy life and learning to slow down prioritize sleep prioritize meditation non-sleep deep rest is something I've benefited from a lot journaling things of that sort that really just kind of slow the pace I think that um you know in the landscape of Health optimization we can often put ourselves into modes of excess in the other direction um meaning doing so much to try and avoid uh issues with health that we end up creating issues with health but yeah certainly reducing caffeine intake and prioritizing sleep are key so that I appreciate that you shared that story so if somebody has naturally low blood pressure and starts to feel a bit um let's just say kind of sleepy or woozy in the afternoon would you recommend um that they obviously not take a a um pressure lowering drug but that they add a bit of salt to their diet that they um feel free to um you know to to exercise less I'm a little bit confused I I also love to run and and do resistance I would recommend they take their blood pressure so um you want to try to correlate any symptoms you're having with vital signs that you modify right so take your blood pressure if you're feeling faint if it's low uh one thing you can do uh easily is to hydrate that was something else I used to not drink much because I don't want to have to pee in the operating room I can imagine that' be pretty uncomfortable I don't want to be the patient that you're operating on when you have to go use the bathroom yeah so now and then uh I'll reveal that I um had a kidney stone which is common among surgeons uh this was a decade ago and since then uh I hydrate all the time so I hydrate to the point that my urine is crystal clear all the time and that helps with some of the brain Clarity so interesting I've done a little bit of work with people in the Special Operations community and you know I think people hear about them and they think oh you know what's what's the magic potion that they're taking what are they doing and they do a number of very interesting things um but one of them is they really emphasize hydration they just like hydration water sometimes water with electrolytes if they're working in in in hot conditions just hydration hydration hydration skeptical um and I used to dehydrate I felt better dehydrated and fit you know but um as I've matured um I think it's very very important um and uh for you know for for your blood pressure for your General Health uh and for your kidneys Yeah you mentioned sleep um is there a relationship between sleep deprivation and stroke risk uh that's a great question there's interestingly um Strokes occur

cognitive learning in the real world and one of the more um important of those is What's called the stop signal task now the stop signal task is something that I'll explain to you I'll also provide a link in the show note caption so you can try it it's actually a lot of fun to try this because it really gives you a sense of just how challenging some of these laboratory tasks are let me just describe it for a moment the stop signal task was really developed and popularized by Gordon Logan and William Cowen Gordon Logan is at Vanderbilt University and has done a lot of really important work uh but one of the important aspects of his work is looking at Motor Performance and skill acquisition and the development of the stop signal task I'll describe the stop signal task for you now in Broad Contour you or another research subject would sit in front of a screen there are two keys on that keyboard or two keys among the other keys on that keyboard one which is designated left the other which is designated right and then on the screen you'll be Pres presented for instance with a left facing or a right facing Arrow so in the initial trial what would happen is that Arrow would pop up on the screen and your job is to press the left key when the right facing arrow is presented you press the right key okay pretty straightforward but there's a limited amount of time in which you can do this and the idea is that you're going to need to do this within approximately 500 milliseconds of the presentation of that Arrow or else it's going to tell you that you missed that trial now of course if you press the wrong key so if the arrow goes goes left and you press the right key then you would be told you got that one wrong okay so this is a reaction time test and not one that's particularly novel what's novel and what Logan and Cowan developed was that in the stop signal task every once in a while not every trial but every once in a while that arrow is presented and then with some delay ranging from anywhere from 100 milliseconds to maybe 350 milliseconds there would be a red circle or a red X also presented which is a stop signal and your job is to not press the key that corresponds to the direction of arrow in fact not press any key at all now you can imagine how if the stop signal shows up with a longer delay after the presentation of the arrow there's a higher probability that you will have already generated the key pressing movement okay so at the link that we provided in the show note caption you can actually do these two tasks and what you'll find is that you and most people will be able to do this Arrow to Reaction Time pressing of the left to right key somewhere in the neighborhood between 300 milliseconds and maybe as long as 500 millisecond delay you'll get an average of how quickly you respond and then of course if you choose to and I would hope you would choose to go on and do the stop signal task you will be told trial by trial whether or not you are hitting the right keys because if you are you'll be allowed to progress to the next trial or if you are told to stop that is you get the stop signal and you press the key anyway you'll be told that you made an error because you did not stop now again with very short delays between the presentation of the arrow and the stop signal you are going to be much better at inhibiting or preventing yourself from the behavior at the no-go aspect of motor execution that is what you will find is that if the stop signal is presented very shortly after let's say 100 milliseconds which is very very brief amount of time after the presentation of the arrow there's a good chance that you're going to be able to withhold the key pressing behavior however if the delay is anywhere from 200 to 350 milliseconds after the presentation of the arrow chances are that you're going to press the button even when you shouldn't have on at least some of those trials okay and if you try and game the system and wait a certain amount of time after the presentation of each Arrow there will also be times in which the stop signal does not appear and you fail to hit the button in the appropriate amount of time so it's a fun little task it doesn't cost any or is that maybe a couple of minutes of your time and if you do have time to go to it I think um it will give you a much deeper flavor for the sorts of experiments that we're talking about here and that you find that these stop signals are actually pretty hard to generate when you're trying to learn some new motor behavior and that actually illustrates a bigger Point here if today you sense that we've been talking about studies of you know tapping fingers and you know stopping button presses and that those examples are highly artificial and don't really translate to the real world well keep in mind that the tasks that are used in these studies really Target the specific neural circuits that is the same neural circuits that you would use for the performance of essentially any motor task now of course other motor tasks like ones where you involve your feet or cognitive tasks where you have to think really hard about specific information and search for that information assemble it in particular ways of course involve other neurons and neural circuits that we haven't discussed today but the core components of these go and no-go tasks or the stop signal task really capture the core elements of most all of cognitive endoor motor learning in some way that's fundamentally important okay so they have real world relevance the paper that I'd like to just briefly describe to you is entitled motor imagery combined with physical training improves response inhibition in the stop signal task okay so that title is a little bit uh wordy but now you know what the stop signal task is and what this paper essentially found was that if people did physical training so the sort of experiment that I just described versus mental training where they sat eyes open and imagined their responses to those arrows and stop signals but they didn't actually generate any key presses versus a combination of the physical training so the actual pressing of the buttons or withholding pressing of the buttons as the case may be plus mental training over the course of about 5 days using the Contour described of the key principles of mental training and performance we talked about I'll get to the specifics in a moment but it really obeyed most all of what we've talked about if not all of it so repetition simple repeated over about five days and so on and so forth what they found was that the mental training and physical training group so mental and real world training groups performed significantly better in the stop signal reaction time that is they were able to withhold action when they needed to withhold action more frequently and with more accuracy vended either the physical training or mental training groups alone so this actually spits in the face of what we said earlier which is that physical training is always better than mental training and mental training is always better than no training and it's important to point out here that both the physical training and the mental training groups experience significant improvements in their reaction time and accuracy at the stop signal task but in the case of this study which is exploring the withholding of inappropriate behaviors the combination of mental training and physical training outperformed either physical or mental training alone so while earlier we said that if you have a certain amount of time in order to train something up physical training is always going to be better than mental training well here we have somewhat of an exception where if the thing you're trying to learn involves withholding mistakes as opposed to trying to generate the right behaviors per se well then you are probably better off doing a combination of mental training and physical training let me state that a little bit differently if you're finding that you're screwing up something not because you can't initiate that particular motor Behavior but you're doing the wrong thing at the wrong time you're not able to withhold a particular action well then in that case mental training in combination with physical training becomes especially important so for you coaches for you students out there keep that in mind when trying to learn how to withhold particular action sequences because they're not serving you well in the real world using a combination of real world training and physical training is actually better for you on an hour per hour basis than is physical training alone a couple of key details about this study should you decide to implement these protocols in this study they did approximately 30 Trials of the thing that they were trying to get better at now they did those in the real world so in this case the stop signal task involved actually pressing those buttons and then they had a test phase of about 144 go trials and about 48 stop trials okay so this is important if you are a coach or you're a student or you're just going to self-direct this kind of learning in your self-directed adaptive plasticity it's important that you mix in both go and no-go trials okay it wasn't always the case that there was a stop signal generated the other thing that was really impressive about the study is that the changes occurred very quickly so the training was performed five times over five days so once a day for five days again back to to this three to five times per week principal and the improvements were really significant in some cases in fact if you decide to puruse this paper uh you can go to um table two and you can see you know in some cases a near doubling in the reduction in reaction time through a combination of mental and physical training compared to physical training alone or mental training alone again however both physical training and mental training groups alone saw significant improvements but the combination of mental training and physical training was far greater than you saw with either one of those alone so that's all nicely Quantified for you in this paper so again I really like this paper despite it not involving a huge number of subjects I think it is a key paper because it really points to such an important element of motor learning and training which is this action withholding component this no-go component that here is captured so nicely in the stop signal task so before we round up our discussion about motor"}

So I started doing the sauna in 2009 in graduate school. - You're an early adopter. - I started doing it every day. I lived across the street. I lived in a studio apartment with Dan. We lived in this small studio apartment, smallest apartment you could ever imagine, and it was across the street from a YMCA, 'cause I was poor in graduate school, very poor, very poor. - I recall. I lived in my lab. - Wow, really? - But, then again, I lived in my lab as a postdoc. I admit, I lived in my lab with my bulldog as a faculty member for other reasons. But I get it. When you're a graduate student, you're poor, basically. - Yes, and so I used to go to the sauna before going into the lab, and I started noticing that I was, all of a sudden, able to handle stress better, like the stress of my six-month setback because of a failed experiment, which is crushing, on top of the pressure from my advisor and my own pressure 'cause I'm very competitive with myself, and I put a lot of pressure on myself. So I was having a hard time. I was very stressed out in graduate school. And this sauna started to really noticeably affect my anxiety and my ability to handle stress. And I was like, what is going on here? So I started looking into the literature and started getting interested in the effects on the brain. And, in fact, at the time, I had a friend who was not actually experimentally but theoretically looking into the opioid system. So, when you get in the sauna, you release a lot of endorphins. Endorphins are the feel-good opioids that make you feel good, but you also release something called dynorphin. And dynorphin is an endogenous opioid that binds to a receptor called the kappa opioid receptor. Dynorphin is responsible for that dysphoric feeling when you're in the sauna and you're hot, and when you're running, doing exercise, and you feel uncomfortable. Well, I think that's dynorphin. I'm speaking absolute, but I think it is. - No, I think it is. I mean, there's evidence in alcoholics that some of the symptoms of withdrawal that they experience are related to dynorphin. And dynorphin is known to negatively impact the dopamine receptor system. So, basically, it's the feel-like-garbage pathway. - Right, you feel like garbage, and so you think that that would not be good, but this is where my friend comes in. He was looking at the effects of treating morphine or heroin addiction. And people that are using those drugs, they, basically, the endorphins or the morphine or heroin, they bind to a receptor in the brain called the mu opioid receptor. And, as they take these drugs, that mu opioid receptor becomes downregulated, and so you need more and more of the drug to feel as good as you did. Well, endorphins also bind to that receptor. And he was looking into some of the other drugs that are like salvinoria, salvinorin, or something. Salvia it's called. It binds to the kappa opioid receptor. It also makes you kind of feel uncomfortable. Anyways, he had put some studies in front of me that showed basically binding of either dynorphin or whatever ligand to the kappa opioid receptor basically sensitizes the mu opioid receptor to the feel-good endorphins and also changes, I think it also upregulates it or something, so, basically, there's a lasting effect of feeling good. So the endorphins that you release later from hugging someone, or a joke you're laughing at, or whatever, you feel it for longer, right? And so, anyways, with respect to the sauna, it's a big sort of hypothesis of mine. I did kind of publish that part of my hypothesis in a review article, but I do wish more people would kind of look into that. That'd be amazing. But what I was getting at, I think, was, I would use the sauna to memorize things. This is way back in the day, and I still do it."}

What's known about breath holds in terms of how it might interact with brain state or oxygen CO2, and I'm particularly interested in how breath holds with lungs empty versus breath holds with lungs full might differ in terms of their impact on the brain. I'm not aware of any studies on this looking at a mechanistic level, but I find it really interesting and even if there are no studies, I'd love if you care to speculate. - Well, one of the breath practices that intrigued me is where you basically hyperventilate for a minute and then hold your breath for as long as you can. - Tummo style, - Yeah, brief shots of air. - Wim Hof style or, we call it in the laboratory, because frankly before Tummo, and before Wim, it was referred to as cyclic hyperventilation. So, it was basically [panting], right? Followed by a breath hold and that breath hold could be done with lungs full or lungs empty. - Right, yeah. So, I had a long talk with some colleagues about what they might think inline mechanisms are, particularly for the breath hold. And I certainly envisioned that there's a component with respect to the presence or absence of that rhythmicity in your cortex, which is having effect. But the other thing with the hyperventilation, hypoventilation or the apnea is your CO2 levels are going from low to high. - Anytime you're holding your breath. - Anytime you hold your breath, okay? And those are going to have a profound influence. Now, I have to talk about episodic hypoxia because there's a lot of work going on particularly with Gordon Mitchell at the University of Florida is doing some extraordinary work on episodic hypoxia. So, in the '80s, David Millhorn did some really intriguing work. If I ask you to hold your breath, excuse me. If I gave you a low oxygen mixture for a couple of minutes, your breathing level would go up 'cause you want to have more oxygen. - You're starving for air. - Yeah. - No, you're starving for oxygen. - All right. - Okay? And for a couple of minutes, you'd go up. You can reach some steady state level. Not so hypoxic that you can't reach an equilibrium. And then I give you room air again, the ventilation quickly relaxes back down to normal. If on the other hand, I gave you three minutes of hypoxia, five minutes of normoxia, three minutes of hypoxia, five minutes of normoxia, three minutes of hypoxia, five minutes in normoxia- - Normoxia being normal air. - Normal air. Your ventilation goes up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down. After the last episode, your breathing comes down and doesn't continue to come down, but rises again and stays up for hours, okay? This is well validated now. This was originally done in animals, but in humans all the time, it seems to have profound benefit on motor function and cognitive function. - In what direction? - Positive, positive. I've often toyed with the idea of getting an 8% oxygen, don't do this, listeners, getting an 8% oxygen tank by my desk when I'm writing a grant and doing like in \"Blue Velvet\" and going through the episodic hypoxia to improve my cognitive functioning, 'cause certainly could use improvement when I'm writing grants. - But you could do this without the low oxygen. I mean, you could do this through breathwork, presumably? - It's hard to lower your oxygen enough. Okay? In the experimental studies, they typically use 8% oxygen. It's hard to hold your breath long enough. And there is another difference here, that is what's happening to your CO2 levels. When you hold your breath, your oxygen levels are dropping, your CO2 levels are going up. When you're doing episodic hypoxia, your CO2 levels are going to stay pretty normal because you're still breathing, it's just the oxygen levels are gone. - So, unlike normal conditions, which you described before, where oxygen is relatively constant and CO2 is fluctuating depending on emotional state and activity and things of that sort, in episodic hypoxia, CO2 is relatively constant, but you're varying the oxygen level coming into the system quite a bit. - I would say it's relatively, I would say CO2 is relatively constant, but it's not going to go in a direction which is going to be significantly far from normal. Whereas when you're holding your breath, you're going to become both hypoxic and hypercapnic at the same time. - We should explain to people what hypoxic and hypercapnic are because we haven't done it. - Okay, hypoxic is just the technical term for low levels of oxygen, hyper, or you could hypoxic, low, hyper is high. So, hyperoxia or hypocapnia, low CO2 or hypercapnia, your highest levels of CO2. So, when you're, in episodic hypoxia, if anything, you're going to become hypocapnic, not hypercapnic. And that could play an influence in this. One example that I remember, and Gordon will have to forgive me if I'm misquoting this,"}
{"question": "What is the process by which muscles get thicker and stronger when subjected to stress, tension, and damage, and how does the nerve communicate with the muscle to stimulate this change?", "doc_id": "XLr2RKoD-oY_13", "video_id": "XLr2RKoD-oY", "video_title": "Science of Muscle Growth, Increasing Strength & Muscular Recovery", "video_header": "What Makes Muscles To Grow? Stress, Tension, & Damage; Myosin Balloons", "segment_idx": "13", "time_start": "39:02", "time_end": "45:18", "context": "and what strength changes in the muscle are. We can make this very simple as well. If this were a muscle physiology class we would talk all about myofibrils and sarcomeres and all that stuff. We're not going to do that. That's not the purpose of today's conversation. If you're interested in that as well as a lot of the other information that I'm going to discuss in more detail, I highly encourage you to check out the YouTube channel and the writings of Dr. Andy Galpin. He's a PhD and a full professor in exercise physiology. He's extremely knowledgeable in this entire area of science-based tools for hypertrophy, how strength and hypertrophy really work. His lab does everything from biopsy on muscles, working with athletes and typical folks as well. A lot of the information that you're going to hear from me in the next 15 minutes or so comes from an extensive exploration of the work that he and his colleagues have done as well as folks like Brad Schoenfeld, another academic who's superb in this whole space of muscle physiology and from a lengthy conversation that I had with Andy, Dr. Galpin prior to this episode. So if we want to think about muscle hypertrophy, we have to ask what is changing when muscles get larger or stronger. And there are really just three ways that muscles can be stimulated to change. So let's review those three ways and talk about what happens inside the muscle. So there are three major stimulate for changing the way that muscle works and making muscles stronger, larger, or better in some way. And those are stress, tension, and damage. Those three things don't necessarily all have to be present but stress of some kind has to exist. Something has to be different in the way that the nerve communicates with the muscle and the way that the muscle contracts or performs that makes the muscle need to change. So this is very reminiscent of neuroplasticity in the brain. Something needs to happen. Certain chemicals need to be present. Certain processes need to happen or else a tissue simply won't change itself. But if those processes and events do happen, then the tissue has essentially no option except, but to change. So muscles move, as I mentioned because nerves dump chemical onto the muscles but they move because they have these things called myosin and actin filaments. And if you want to read up on this, you can look on the internet you can put the sliding filament theory of muscle contraction if you really want to go deep down that rabbit hole. It's interesting. You can learn about this in a muscle physiology class. But basically, along the length of the muscle you have, what's called myosin. And just think of myosin as kind of like a wire. It's like a bunch of beads and wires that extend across the muscle. I think that's the simplest way to describe it. And the myosin is surrounded by these little beads called actin. The way muscles get bigger is that basically the myosin gets thicker. It's a protein and it gets thicker. So put this in your mind if you're listening to this or even if you're watching it on YouTube, the way to think about this whole actin myosin thing and thing and muscles getting bigger is imagine that you're holding a bouquet of balloons, a bunch of balloons by their strings except you're not holding the strings all at their bottom. So the bouquet isn't nicely arranged. It's not like some balloons that are all up at the top and you're holding the strings down at the bottom. Imagine that one of the balloons that is very close to your hand and other one is a little bit higher up. And so this bouquet is very disorganized. In other words, the string extending out of your hand the strings rather extending out of your hand are all different lengths. And so the balloons are all over the place. That's essentially what myosin looks like in the muscle. And those strings are what we call the filaments, and then the myosin head is the balloon. When you stress a muscle properly, or you give it sufficient tension, or you damage the muscle just enough, there's an adaptive response that takes place where protein is synthesized. And it's a very specific protein, it's myosin. The myosin gets thicker. In other words, the balloons get bigger. So the way to think about muscle growth and the way to think about muscles getting stronger is that those balloons get bigger and the muscle gets thicker. Now, the question then should be as always how does that happen? I mean, the muscle doesn't really know anything about what's happening in the outside world. The way it happens is the nerve, the neuron has to tell the muscle to get stronger. And it does that through what we call a signaling cascade. It talks to the muscle in terms of chemicals. It doesn't whisper to it or shout or Hey, get bigger. What it does it release a certain chemicals that within the muscle, there are certain chemicals released rather that make those balloons as I'm referring to them, the myosin get thicker. So let's talk about the stimulus for doing that. And if already in your mind, you're imagining oh my goodness, these balloons of muscle are going to get thick, thick, thick, thick, thick, and it's just going to spiral out of control, don't worry about that. People invest a ton of time and energy into trying to make their muscles larger. It's actually much harder for people to do than you might think. But I do want to give one exception because it illustrates an important principle of where we're headed next. Everybody has imbalances in how muscles can grow. How well muscles can grow, or how poorly, or how challenging it is for their muscles to grow. Now, many people who are afraid of like getting too bulky for instance, are afraid of lifting weights. But I think the research shows now that every one of pretty much every age should be doing some sort of resistance exercise even if that's body weight exercises in order to offset this age-related decline in muscle contractile ability, muscle strength, et cetera, improve bone density. There's nothing good about getting frail and weak over time. And people who invest the effort into doing resistance exercises of some kind whether or not it's with bands or with weights or with body weight, really benefit tremendously at a whole body level at a systemic level as well as in terms of muscle strength. There is a good predictor of how well"}

presumably know provides support for important research and when I say important research we can Define that as research that is done on humans with humans with their consent of course that we believe stands the highest probability of leading to New Quality treatments and improvements in mental health physical health and performance so support from the premium channel that is from you has already allowed us to make several substantial gifts to various Laboratories as well as some other um some other endeavors so I'll just quickly tell you where those funds have gone and then I'll tell you something really truly exciting about where we're headed in 2024 we'll get to the questions in a moment but I think this is important to hear first of all we made a um a year-long gift and when I say year-long gift we're talking gifts that I certainly can say from my perspective as a researcher who's run a laboratory for a very long time these are the size gifts that allow researchers to do research that they otherwise would not have been able to do they pay salaries they pay uh for materials in the laboratory they pay for the sorts of things that allow signs to happen that would not otherwise happen we made a gift to Dr Aaliyah crumbs laboratory at Stanford in the department of psychology uh she studies mindset some of you may have seen the episode with Ally as she's called um Dr Crum on the hubman Lab podcast she's studying mindsets and how they affect both mental health and physical health in children and adults and that work hopefully we'll get a report back on at some point soon about how those mindsets can improve performance in school work Athletics and other areas of life so the idea here is that you supported that work through the premium channel and then that work can happen and then we can get the information about what the conclusions of that work are out into the general population meaning into the public so that people can benefit from that knowledge right away and in many cases Implement that knowledge we also made a gift to Dr sain Panda at the Suk Institute for biological study sain panda is an expert in circadian biology and intermittent fasting and the study he is using those funds for relates to intermittent fasting as a specific tool for improving mental health we also made a gift to Dr Carla shatz in at Stanford University School of Medicine she's studying how the immune system and maternal conditions and in especially infections or uh of various kinds that um pregnant women sometimes encounter or get can affect the developing fetal brain and that work also relates to stem cells I know there's a lot of excitement about stem cells nowadays so I'll give you an update on that as soon as I can we also made a substantial gift to Dr Joanna Stein glass at Columbia University School of Medicine Dr Stein glass has not yet been on the podcast but hopefully she will have time to come on the podcast at some point soon uh she's studying and developing novel treatments for eating disorders uh if you didn't see the episode on healthy and disordered eating um sadly uh anorexia nervosa is the most deadly of all the psychiatric conditions that is a great number of patients that have anorexia nervosa unfortunately go on to die of uh malnourishment and things related to malnourishment so it's a critical critical issue that's not talked about enough and frankly is not um well funded enough at the level of federal funding but um through your support there's now funding um siphoning into her laboratory and she's directing those funds directly at novel treatments based on neuroscience and habit formation for eating disorders anorexia and other Eating Disorders Dr Nolan Williams also at Stanford who does work on transcranial magnetic stimulation which is a tool to non-invasively alter neural circuits in the brain uh for purposes of relieving depression and PTSD and excitingly Dr Williams laboratory also combines TMS transcranial magnetic stimulation with psychedelic treatments um in particular ibaan but also psilocybin I know there's a lot of excitement about that and then last but certainly not least uh we also funded a chronobiology conference they were um desperate for funds uh reached out and we were delighted to provide the funds for that uh conference those funds allowed graduate students in postdocs who come from from Laboratories that couldn't afford to send those students in post talks to that conference to attend that conference and I must say from a lot of years of experience in the scientific Community the ability to attend these high quality meetings is absolutely critical for those young scientists to be able to glean important information and go back to their own Laboratories and to make novel contributions also can be the difference between a new collaboration getting sparked up or not and uh I should just mention that the the Research Laboratories that we fund were at a much higher level than the conferences but the conferences I think are also a really important um way to direct funds uh for those of you who don't know chronobiology is how the timing of light temperature and exercise and eating affect health so all things that I think uh people are interested in so uh that's it for what we covered um and what we supported in 2023 we're very proud of the support that we were able to provide thanks to your help and I am very very excited to announce that while in 2023 it was scom us the hubman Lab podcast through your premium uh Channel support that allows us to make that support and we had a matching donation dollar Ford dooll donation from the tiny Foundation heading into 2024 tiny Foundation is going to continue to do a dollar dollar a dollar Ford dooll match excuse me which is exciting and we've brought on in addition to that two other donors who are going to also do dollar for dooll donations so in other words for every dollar that the Hub lab premium channel has or raises in 2024 there will be $3 to match that so this is phenomenal and what it means is that the scom and hubman Lab podcast are now doing what's considered on University campuses as major philanthropy so very exciting um and so thank you Oho very much for your support you are making a difference in the research and I don't just say that I know anytime there's fundraisers things of that sort by the way this is not a fundraiser This Is Us saying thank you to you but it's always hard to know where those funds go and um we make sure that the whole process is very streamlined we cut the fat on the on it in every Dimension so that um the money can go to discovering new tools for mental health physical health and performance so thank you so much okay"}
{"question": "Can you explain why people who start drinking at a young age are more likely to develop alcoholism, even if they don't have a family history of the condition?", "doc_id": "DkS1pkKpILY_12", "video_id": "DkS1pkKpILY", "video_title": "What Alcohol Does to Your Body, Brain & Health", "video_header": "Genetic Predisposition for Alcoholism, Consuming Alcohol Too Young", "segment_idx": "12", "time_start": "46:12", "time_end": "52:23", "context": "I'd like to make about that. First of all, what sorts of genes are involved in setting someone down the path of alcoholism or not? Well, it should come as no surprise that the genes that chronic alcohol usage modifies, they tend to fall primarily in the pathways related to genetic control over serotonin receptors, GABA receptors, remember that top-down inhibition and the involvement of GABA, and, no surprise, the HPA, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. All of those, of course combined with environment, they combine with patterns of abuse, right, we know that if you're in a social setting where a lot of people are drinking, the likelihood that you're going to drink is much higher, social pressures, trauma, right? Some people will use alcohol to self-medicate to try and turn off their thinking or to deal with trauma, et cetera. So they combine with the environment, but the genes that are in the serotonin synthesis and receptor synthesis pathway, GABA and HPA axis, combine with environmental pressures to give rise to alcohol use disorders. So there's a fairly coherent picture that we have here, right? This is not a case where, for instance, people that have a lot of the enzyme for metabolizing alcohol, which we'll talk about in a minute, alcohol dehydrogenase, it's not like they are necessarily the people that become alcoholics, whereas certainly in certain cultures, certain Asian cultures in particular, there are gene differences that lead them to have low levels of alcohol dehydrogenase. There are actually people who have so little alcohol dehydrogenase that when they ingest alcohol, they get very red and they just feel sick. So if you're somebody that has a sip of alcohol and you just feel horrible, it makes you feel nauseous, chances are you have gene variants that create a situation where you're not making very much alcohol dehydrogenase. You just simply can't metabolize alcohol so you just get a rapid buildup of the toxic effects of alcohol, the acetaldehyde, you're not converting it into those empty calories. But in cultures where you have a lot of genetic variants and genes expressed in people where they have a lot of alcohol dehydrogenase, sure, they can drink more, and they're converting more of that alcohol from its toxic form to a non-toxic form, and, yes, of course, you will observe more alcoholism in those communities because they're drinking more, but I do want to emphasize that the environmental factors are playing a strong role there, too, because if you can drink more, you're likely to drink more. If you're somebody that feels sick immediately from drinking, it's likely that you're not going to engage in alcohol consumption, especially if these things are genetically related, and, of course, genes and culture and location in the world tend to run together. So do you have the gene for alcoholism? Well, there isn't one single gene. Chances are if you have an immediate relative who's a chronic abuser of alcohol or several relatives who are chronic abusers of alcohol, well, that's going to predispose you to be an alcoholic. But since you don't know which genes you express unless you do genetic testing, and those things are available but most people aren't doing that, this assay, if you will, and it's not an assay, as we say, an assay is a test that you run in the lab to determine something, and it's not one that I recommend that you go drink in order to do, but if you've noticed that you or somebody else is somebody who can drink a lot throughout the night and have increased energy and can just drink and drink and drink, and especially if there's blackout episodes, not remembering things the next day despite being alert throughout the entire night and so on, well, then I would be very concerned that you might actually have a genetic variant predisposing you to alcoholism. The other thing that predisposes people to abuse of alcohol is age. People who start drinking at younger ages are greatly predisposed to developing alcohol dependence regardless of your family history of alcoholism. Okay, so I'm going to repeat that. People who start drinking younger are at great risk for developing alcoholism even if they don't have alcoholism in their family. Now, of course, you don't have to be an epidemiologist to understand that if you grow up in a family of drinkers and alcohol is everywhere, and especially if there's peer pressure or lack of oversight, then there's going to be a higher tendency, or a higher probability, I should say, that you will start drinking at a younger age. However, even people that grow up nowhere near their relatives, if they start drinking at a young age, so for instance, at 13 or younger or 14 or 15, there's a much higher probability that they're going to develop a long-lasting dependence on alcohol. People who take their first sip of alcohol later, 15, 16, or one would hope even later, I can say one would hope 'cause I'm now of that, you know, age and generation where, you know, you think about all the things that young people do, and you go, \"Oh, gosh, if they only would wait or if they only would abstain.\" You know? It's just what happens. I don't know, there's some neural circuit for that that I can't explain yet. But people who, for instance, drink only once they reach legal age of drinking, which in the US, I believe in every state is 21 years old, if they take their first drink at 21, the probability that they'll go on to develop full-blown alcohol dependence or alcohol use disorder, as it's called, AUD, is very low. Now, a subset of them will because they have such a strong genetic predisposition or maybe life circumstances create a pattern in which they become a chronic drinker. But I found this very interesting. Genes matter, but also the age in which somebody starts drinking really matters. Now, whether or not that's because there are changes in neural circuitry as a consequence of that drinking that make people want to seek out more and more alcohol, or whether or not there's some other effect, maybe it's a change in hormones, et cetera, that predisposes those young drinkers to become chronic drinkers or even full-blown alcoholics, certainly developing alcohol use disorder. There's a definition for that. We can talk about it. It involves the amount of drinking over a certain period of time, et cetera. So it's very clear that drinking early in life creates a propensity for the development of alcohol use disorder later in life. And while there is a genetic component to developing alcohol use disorder, I find it very interesting that if people who have those gene variants delay their onset of drinking, well, then the probability that they'll develop full-blown alcohol use disorder drops as well. So again, it's genes and environments. It's not an either/or and there's no single gene for alcoholism."}

A few studies have also looked at eating a sort of maintenance level of calories for five days, and then taking two days and fast clear through, or eating very few calories, you know, 300 or 500 calories. In fact, there's a sort of a community online of people that are exploring longer, fast for sake of trying to offset dementia or reverse effects of dementia, thus far, at least in my awareness, there isn't any quality clinical peer reviewed study on that yet for sake of dementia, although I await those studies, and if anyone's aware of them, please send me a link in the comments. But alternate day fasting has gotten the so-called safe bill of health. This has been written up meaning that people didn't suffer bone loss, they didn't suffer any major detrimental effects. It does seem that it can create significant weight loss and can help with obese individuals that it can reduce resting blood glucose, and every other day fasting in many cases can produce more rapid effects on weight loss and reductions in blood glucose than time restricted feeding, however, every other day type fasting for most people is not going to be feasible. They're just not going to be able to do that for a long period of time. And what hasn't really been done is the follow-up to see whether or not people who do every other day fasting or five days of eating followed by two days of fasting, whether or not that leads to a rebound in weight gain, whether or not that leads to a rebound in blood glucose, et cetera. So for now the eight hour feeding window and time restricted feeding seems to be the most tested, supported in animal studies and in human studies and the one around which I think most people should orient if they're considering getting into time-restricted feeding, it's also sort of hard to imagine how one could include a"}
{"question": "What are the main differences between organic (chemical) sunscreens and inorganic (mineral-based) sunscreens, and which type is considered safer?", "doc_id": "1CxJVdeyltw_8", "video_id": "1CxJVdeyltw", "video_title": "How to Improve Skin Health & Appearance", "video_header": "Organic (Chemical) Sunscreen & Inorganic (Mineral-Based) Sunscreen", "segment_idx": "8", "time_start": "36:54", "time_end": "49:14", "context": "sunscreens now the reason I changed my tone of voice voice with this is that if you look on the internet you will see claims that I don't use or believe in sunscreen that is just false I've worn sunscreen my entire life I don't necessarily wear every day I don't tend to burn easily okay I have some natural level of pigmentation in my skin based on my genetics as I mentioned earlier but as we talked about earlier just avoiding sunburn is not going to protect me or anyone else against certain sun-induced mutations in skin cells and the aging effects that sun can have so I do believe in certain sunscreens meaning I will put sunscreen on on certain days on certain parts of my body however I do believe now having spoken to multiple dermatologists and looked into the literature very deeply that there are certain chemicals in certain sunscreens that are of concern I don't mean that if you put these on once or even twice that you are going to suffer negative consequences I mean they are of concern meaning we should pay attention to them and when given the option we should opt for the healthier choices and in fact there are known healthier choices to make all of this very clear I'm going to tell you what is very clear to the Dermatology community at this point in time okay in June of 2024 here's what we know there are two major types of sunscreens out there well really three we talked about physical barrier before no one argues about a physical barrier no one's worried about the chemical compos I of physical barriers okay when we talk about sunscreen so lotions creams sprays Etc there are two major types the first are organic types which is essentially chemical sunscreens okay so when you hear organic sunscreens that means chemical type sunscreens and then there are inorganic types which are sometimes referred to as mineral-based sunscreens here's what most everybody seems to accept that mineral-based sunscreens meaning sunscreen that tend to include either zinc oxide or titanium dioxide or both in some cases are generally thought to be safe up to concentrations of 25% 25% is a pretty high concentration you can find sunscreens out there that have 25% zinc oxide or 25% titanium dioxide they're rare to find however more often you'll find sunscreens that have 15% 10% 18% zinc oxide sometimes alone or in combination with titanium dioxide you'll find some pure titanium dioxide sunscreens out there alth those are a bit more rare right a little bit harder to find here's the story zinc oxide and titanium dioxide reflect back UV light those short wavelengths of light that would otherwise potentially cause mutations in your skin cells at the level of the epidermis okay in the outermost layers of skin remember short wavelength light doesn't pass very deeply into the skin sunscreens containing zinc oxide Andor titanium dioxide were engineered for that specific purpose to reflect back UV light this is very different than organic or chemical sunscreens which contain certain compounds these Go by different names oxybenzone avobenzone there are a bunch of these different chemicals that are contained in so-called organic or chemical sunscreens those chemicals in general don't serve to reflect back UV light but rather absorb UV light okay so when they're applied to the skin they're designed to absorb the UV light so that the UV light can't negatively impact the skin those chemical again chemical AKA organic components within organic sunscreens again sometimes called chemical sunscreens are designed to absorb UV light mineral-based sunscreens so-called inorganic sunscreens containing things like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide are designed to reflect back UV light why am I telling you this well I'm telling you this because it's generally believed that the zinc oxide and titanium dioxide containing sunscreens are safe up to concentrations of 25% whereas there is some again some concern about the chemicals within chemical AKA organic sunscreens as potential endocrine disruptors so disrupting things like testosterone synthesis estrogen synthesis and other hormones it's not all just about testosterone and estrogen folks other hormone Pathways that many people including some governing bodies and agencies that assess the safety of different cosmetic and sunscreen products are concerned about now how concerned they are depends on where you are in the world okay so in Europe they have different stringencies for what is considered safe versus unsafe or just of concern as opposed to in the US here's what every dermatologist in the US because those are the ones I spoke to told me which is that it is advised that on children younger than 6 months of age you do not use chemical based B sunscreens why well young skin even the skin on the external part of the body in children 6 months or younger acts more like mucosal skin in that it can very easily absorb things transdermally through the skin however even as we age so into puberty our young adult years and even into our elderly years there is still a capacity for things to pass transdermally through the skin although because of some of the additional barriers formed within the dermal and epidermal layers of the skin like extracellular Matrix the changes in collagen Etc there is less tendency for compounds to pass transdermally through the skin now that just simply highlights the fact that if you are a very young person or if you're applying sunscreen to a very young person maybe six months or younger but also perhaps older depending on how careful you want to be to avoid these chemical-based sunscreens there is very little if any evidence that the mineral-based sunscreens are of concern for transdermal pass into the skin at concentrations of 25% or less meaning sunscreens containing zinc oxide and titanium dioxide are probably safe or at least have been deemed safe enough that they are freely available on the market and we are told that they are safe for people of all ages so if you are somebody who is concerned about the chemicals in sunscreen most every dermatologist or chemist who works on sunscreens will tell you well mineral-based inorganic sunscreens are going to be your safer option if you're concerned but get this the chemical-based sunscreens while some of the chemicals in them indeed can be quite scary when you read the literature you look at some of these things like oxybenzone um avobenzone and some similar chemicals even at low concentrations have been shown to be endocrine disruptors people talk about how the fact when they apply these sunscreens they can taste them in their mouth there's a lot of fear around these and some of that fear is substantiated when one goes and looks at the studies that have been done on these chemical-based sunscreens you may find it interesting to note that the way these studies were done often involves having people apply a ton of these chemical based sunscreens like two full bottles of these sunscreens over the course of a very short period of time and then have their blood drawn and then it's revealed that some of these chemical components are within the blood so a big issue that's not often discussed because it's very difficult to control for in a natural setting but is straightforward to control for in a laboratory setting is how much sunscreen one is applying and how often and across how many years of time so there's no real prescriptive that can tell you hey if you put chemical sunscreens on once that's problematic although certainly pay attention to that six months and younger what is essentially a rule that I mentioned earlier and do not put chemical based sunscreens on really young kids you might want to avoid them entirely depending on how stringent you are about this stuff but when it comes to chemical based sunscreens personally I avoid them but then it becomes a question of if you could only use a chemical based sunscreen you simply look at the label some of these have by the way zinc oxide titanium oxide and chemical based components okay keep that in mind some are purely mineral based some are purely chemical based but if you look at a sunscreen label you know okay well this is the only thing available on this very hot day with a very high UV index and otherwise I'm going to get a burn well if you're really concerned then I would resort to a physical barrier if you are less concerned then you could perhaps tell yourself okay you get to put it on that day but you might not want to use it every day and you might want to use a small volume of it right or maybe just on parts of your face or your ears or your neck that are particularly sensitive to Sun okay these are the things that need to be taken into consideration but when we step back from all of this all of the literature including by the way some of the literature that assessed and I'll put a link to this review a review on the potential neurotoxicity of titanium dioxide nanoparticles I'll get into this in a moment it has been explored whether or not titanium dioxide is more risky than zinc oxide talk about that in a moment but when you step back from all of this here's what you get physical barrier no one argues About That No One Believes that clothing is dangerous per se when it comes to avoiding excessive sun exposure again excessive relates to your skin tone your background genetics your activities and where you are in the world and what time of year okay very specific to your needs very few folks are concerned about mineral-based inorganic sunscreen so if you want to use sunscreen as many people do and you want to make sure that it's not an endocrine disruptor and it's not a neurotoxin or something else that's been raised for some of these chemical-based sunscreens well then find a sunscreen that has 25% less zinc oxide and or titanium dioxide if you were a bit more concerned about say titanium dioxide and some of the suggestive evidence only suggestive evidence that maybe titanium dioxide is more risky than zinc oxide especially when it's in its Nano form the very small form that may indeed allow it for more easy Passage through the layers of the skin that transdermal passage will then find a sunscreen that is purely zinc oxide sunscreen and again they always have other things in them but what I mean is the only active ingredient in a zinc oxide only containing sunscreen is zinc oxide and then there are a bunch of other things that allow it to be a lotion for instance again up to 25% concentration why would somebody not want to use zinc oxide containing sunscreen up to 25% and opt for anything else you might ask right if that's considered safe the reason is the consistency of the zinc oxide is it's pretty sticky and thick and it's kind of pasty right back in the 80s and 90s some of you may recall that had um zinc oxide um sunscreens that would actually you know color the nose white so you could really see it was really prominent on the face they tried to turn that into a fashion statement didn't go over so well over time but in any case the addition of titanium dioxide to those zinc oxide containing sunscreens allow it to be a bit silkier so that it would spread on more evenly and then you may say well why even put chemicals in sunscreen at all if there's risk the reason why chemical-based organic sunscreens even exist is that they can come up with compositions of those sunscreens that are very silky and that could spread on clear over makeup and things of that sort but there are these concerns about some of those chemical components as endocrine disruptors and potentially as mutagens that could cause other issues or you know any number of different things you you know you can find all sorts of concerns out there on the internet most of those concerns are not substantiated but these chemicals can be problematic at high concentrations and that takes us back to the point made earlier which is that in the studies of those chemicals and the reasons in some cases being banned in certain countries and other countries carrying uh warning recommendations the amount of those chemical-based sunscreens that were applied was exceedingly high so if you're wearing sunscreen very often you're wearing a lot of it probably best of year towards a mineral-based sunscreen if you are concerned at all about the chemicals in chemical based sunscreen wear a mineral based sunscreen and or use physical barrier and if you're somebody who just doesn't believe that sunscreens are safe whatsoever well you know as far as I know it's a free world you don't have to wear sunscreen but then I would say you need to be very aware of the fact that sun can induce the appearance of accelerated aging in the skin right that's an actual process that takes place there's really no debating that frankly and sun exposure can potentially accelerate or even give"}
{"question": "How long do the sessions in the study last, and what is the typical duration of a spin class session that the participants were engaged in?", "doc_id": "099hgtRoUZw_13", "video_id": "099hgtRoUZw", "video_title": "Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Boost Attention & Memory with Science-Based Tools | Huberman Lab Podcast #73", "video_header": "Tool: Exercise Protocol for Improving Cognition", "segment_idx": "13", "time_start": "1:05:40", "time_end": "1:12:12", "context": "everybody was studying people 65 or older because that's when cognitive decline begins. And if the idea is exercise can help you with your cognition, then makes sense. However, I thought, well, you know that it's great, there's lots of work there. I wanted to know what happens in people in their 40s and their 50s, maybe even their 30s and their 20s. Why, because that's when we, as humans are able, ready, willing, and able to increase our exercise and gets us set up to build our brains as we go into our 60s. And so the first study that I did looked at low fit participants from their 30s to mid 50s, and we wanted to ask this question, how much exercise do you really need to start seeing benefits? Do you see benefits? Or maybe you have to wait until you start seeing cognitive decline to get benefits. That was one of the theories out there. And so that's what I wanted to do. And so what we did was three months of two to three times a week cardio, it was a spin class, so spin classes are great for cardio. And the comparison group was two to three times a week of competitive video Scrabble. So no heart rate change, but they had to come into my lab and be in a group just like they were in a group for the spin class. We touched them cognitively at the beginning and the end of the session. What we found was two to three times a week of cardio in these people, they are low fit, which means specifically that they were exercising less than 30 minutes a week for the three months previous to the experiment. So they went from that to two to three times a week of spin class and what we found was changes in baseline rates of their positive mood states went up relative to the video Scrabble group. Their body image got more positive because they were exercising, which is great. And really important, their motivation to exercise went up significantly compared to the video Scrabble group, which is great. So the more you exercise, the more motivated you are to exercise. What about cognition? What changed in the cognitive circuits of their brain? Number one, we got improved performance on the Stroop task, but we're headed towards my favorite structure, which is the hippocampus. What we found was improved performance on both a recognition memory task, which was a memory and coding task, and that is, can you differentiate similar items that we're asking you to remember, and a spatial episodic memory task, where we had them play one of those Doom like games when they went into this spatial maze and they had to do things in a virtual city. Their performance there got better, which is very, very classically dependent on the hippocampus. So this, it was so satisfying to do this study because I've been wanting to answer this question, what is a minimum amount or doable amount of exercise that will get you these cognitive benefits? And now I can say in 30-to-50-year olds that are low fit, two to three times a week. Is that doable, absolutely. Will it be hard if you're low fit, yeah, it's going to be challenging, but absolutely doable. And so it makes sense with all of the mechanisms that we are, I didn't study the mechanisms just to be clear, but with all the mechanisms we are imagining are playing a role here, that absolutely makes sense and it is doable. This is not like you have to become marathon runner to get any of these benefits. This is you have to start moving your body on a regular basis two to three times a week. So I love that for its realness. - How long are those sessions again? - 45 Minutes. - 45 Minutes. - Yeah, 45 minutes, it's a typical spin kind of class. There's a warmup for five minutes and a cool down for five minutes, so it's really 35 minutes of they're really pushing you. - And so they're breathing reasonably hard. Heart rate is up. - Heart rate is up definitely up, yeah - I find that all of those results are really interesting that the results showing improvement in motivation to exercise is interesting, 'cause it gets back to this issue of kind of a self-amplifying effect. And the neuroscientist in me wants to think about kind of pre-motor circuits and the fact that we have a motor system that can obviously do things like lift cups, and walk, and run if we want to or need to, but that it's possible to create a kind of anticipatory activity in our nervous system where our body craves a certain stimulus, you mentioned the cold and how you crave the cold. Now whether or not that's the adrenaline, and the dopamine, etc., or whether or not somebody who exercises, going from zero, less than 30 minutes per week to two to three times a week, 45 minutes, as you described for this study. I've had that experience before of that the cardio, that I tend to battle the most, I love lifting heavy objects, at least heavy for me. I'm happy to go to the gym every other day and just lift heavy objects for an hour. It just makes me happy, I like the way it feels, and I've been doing it since I was in my teens, so 30 years. Cardio's a little bit trickier. I like to run, but if I stop running for a little while I find it very hard to get back into. But if I start running three times a week for 30 to 45 minutes and I do this pretty consistently on the days I don't weight train, I find that I start to crave it. It's almost as if my body needs that in order to, I always say, clear out the cobwebs, but it's like my mind doesn't function as well, clearly now I understand why and why exercise helps, but also physically I almost feel like my body needs to engage in that movement. Like the pre-motor circuits are kind of revving, kind of like revving then engine on a car while it's in park. So the motivation to exercise obviously could be multifaceted. It could be purely psychological, but do you think there's any reason to speculate at least"}

I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today my guest is Dr. Charles Zuker. Dr. Zuker is a professor of biochemistry and molecular biophysics and of neuroscience at Columbia University School of Medicine. Dr. Zuker is one of the world's leading experts in perception. That is how the nervous system converts physical stimuli in the world into events within the nervous system that we come to understand as our sense of smell, our sense of taste, our sense of vision, our sense of touch, and our sense of hearing. Dr. Zuker's lab is responsible for a tremendous amount of pioneering and groundbreaking work in the area of perception, for a long time his laboratory worked on vision, defining the very receptors that allow for the conversion of light into signals that the rest of the eye and the brain can understand. In recent years, his laboratory is focused mainly on the perception of taste. And indeed his laboratory is responsible for discovering many of the taste receptors leading to our perception of things like sweetness, sourness, bitterness, saltiness, and umami. That is savoriness in food. Dr. Zuker's laboratory is also responsible for doing groundbreaking work on the sense of thirst. That is how the nervous system determines whether or not we should ingest more fluid or reject fluids that are offered to us. A key feature of the work from Dr. Zuker's laboratory is that it bridges the brain and body. As you'll soon learn from today's discussion. His laboratory has discovered a unique set of sugar sensing neurons that exist not just within the brain, but a separate set of neurons. That sense sweetness and sugar within the body. And that much of the communication between the brain and body leading to our seeking of sugar is below our conscious detection. Dr. Zuker has received a large number of prestigious awards and appointments as a consequence of his discoveries in neuroscience. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Medicine, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He is also an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. For those of you that are not familiar with the so-called HHMI, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigators are selected on an extremely competitive basis. And indeed they have to come back every five years and prove themselves worthy of being reappointed as Howard Hughes investigators, Dr. Zuker has been a Howard Hughes investigator since 1989. What all that means for you as a viewer and or listener of today's podcast, is that you are about to learn about the nervous system and its ability to create perceptions in particular, the perception of taste and sugar sensing from the world's expert on perception and taste. I'm certain that by the end of today's podcast, you're not just going to come away with a deeper understanding of our perceptions and our perception of taste in particular. But indeed you will come away with an understanding of how we create internal representations of the entire world around us and in doing so, how we come to understand our life experience."}

not a a process in which we we ever really get to cruise so let's Orient Coleman ruy in that cycle um you seem to have returned to the Ordinary World um for those listening and not watching you've been whenever you describe the uh the feeling of getting through but also the that people assisted you you smile MH as friendly a guy as you are I think in the first three years I knew you I didn't see you smile once that's probably true I didn't see you smile once I just thought like and these like dear one team guys they're they're serious they're locked in they're locked in but um you smile a lot now yeah so I think you're back in the Ordinary World mhm um what are the things you're watchful for um like like you're not drinking you pay attention to your sleep you always trained you always did it you call it PT but physical training yeah yeah I Train Cycle run MH swim lots of kettle bells yeah every morning uh I train probably five out of seven days and the two days that I don't train I'm in I have a sauna at my house I'm in sauna at least for an hour mhm it's so funny how uh Team guys talk about getting into cold or getting in the sauna like it's just a regular thing like they they don't they never post it to social media for them it's just it's part of the routine yeah but I say that because I think a lot of people think it's like this esoteric biohacking thing wrestlers and and uh people in the military are accustomed to like sauna cold sauna cold just like cardio lifting weights it's not this esoteric thing no no I mean I think on average there's a sauna in Finland for like every single person in the country so we didn't invent some amazing recovery process by doing SAA right what do you think um what do you think it is about physical movement that helps the Mind obviously it's not it's I consider it necessary but not sufficient like you you need to do the talk therapy the working through the writing the reading the inpe the talking to other people maybe pharmacology but it's it does seem to be so important for resetting us what do you think it is about physical movement I mean since it might go back to John Rady's little anecdote and Spark you know the SE squirt I guess swims around then as soon as it does whatever it needs to do it just dies when it stops moving oh yeah when the so the SE squirt is this uh aquatic animal uh apia as it were that that when it um lands on a on a rock and stops moving it actually digests its own nervous system that movement uh is the great Nobel prize winning scientist sharington that said that movement is the final common pathway that movement is the way that the nervous system tells the brain and rest of nervous system that it's still needed here on Earth Earth H which I like it's it's like a it's like a a it reminds us of our own utility yeah in a neural way I mean whatever that is Andrew right the chemistry and the neurobiology of it all this goes back again going back to seventh grade I was at the end of the Rope on the detentions and the suspension and I have this very clear memory that before my dad got home like I ran laps I don't know how many but a lot around the block and by the time he got home I was like whatever my punishment is I'm good like I'm not worried about it that physical activity for me all the time I don't want to overdo the runner's high thing but whatever that is that's what I think it is like when I'm in motion or my heart rate's up for the most part everything's fine and I'm clearheaded and I cannot be again dropping and drinking I can't be lethargic and sit around like I have to you know take care of myself in that regard um I watch my sleep super close if it gets past 10:30 I'm in like a full-blown panic I need to get to a pillow the the basics like I don't do anything crazy really um you eat what you want no no I would say on the neurotic scale of things that's probably my most extreme there probably a little bit of cutting weight kind of like eating disorder issues if I was guessing not that extreme you eat meat vegetables yeah yeah yeah but I'm I'm a really light eater I eat like a bird and probably eight times a day maybe more um eight times a day oh easily I'll have you know I'll thanks to you I'll wait an hour and a half to have coffee which is miserable um you're welcome but oh it's amazing thank you it's helped me so much well you know I I take some some uh some for it because some people say do I have to well if I train first thing then I'll have my coffee first thing it was really to stay the afternoon crash but a lot of people find that experiencing that natural wakeup and look it's 90 minutes it's not it's not like cutting out for two days or two weeks or Michael Paul and I think quit coffee I was like why the world would you do that yeah why in the world um I love coffee love yber M always have um from from from first sip which by the way I had my first gourd of M Caffe mon when I was four there's a picture of me and my grandfather's up that's hilarious Argentine side yeah so but the the point here is that um you know these practices these things I think they involve a little bit of discipline but they they they really can't have an outsized effect I think oh my goodness yeah the it's incredible I mean the eating thing and then maybe you know one more mental thing in this regard um I'll probably have maybe an avocado in the morning and then two hours later maybe one hour later I'll have sliced cheese and apple and then so you're a light Grazer really light I probably have the smallest plate at dinner in my house um we've always been in great shape like visually you always you're tall you're lean you're strong yeah yeah I I think we're realizing now that you can still train on uh you have to be like gorging oneself with calories yeah especially now right like we're both approaching 50 it's actually surprising how much I've discovered we can do on how few calories and I'm not trying to like test it some crazy way but then just eat throughout the day and you know macro life experience Andre I just cut a bunch of extra out of my life big end little things like I don't I try to just do my job and you know do a good job at it and hang out with my people friends and and family and uh all the extra Shenanigans like I'll maybe do you know I was always doing some big race or some big

{"question": "Is it necessary for a 20-year-old who is maintaining a healthy lifestyle to get blood tests done annually, or can they wait longer for a more meaningful assessment of their health?", "doc_id": "DTCmprPCDqc_5", "video_id": "DTCmprPCDqc", "video_title": "Dr. Peter Attia: Exercise, Nutrition, Hormones for Vitality & Longevity", "video_header": "Blood Testing: Best Frequency", "segment_idx": "5", "time_start": "14:00", "time_end": "15:57", "context": "if somebody feels pretty good and is taking a number of steps, exercise, nutrition, et cetera, to try and extend lifespan and improve health span, is once a year frequent enough, and should a 20-year-old start getting blood work done just to get a window into what's going on? Assuming that they can afford it or their insurance can cover it. - Yeah, I mean, look, I certainly think everybody should be screened early in life because if you look at, like, what's the single most prevalent genetic driver of atherosclerosis, is Lpis, and yet somewhere between eight and 12% of the population has a high enough, and depending on who you, you know, I had a recent guest on my podcast who suggested it could be as high as 20%, have a high enough Lp[a], that it is contributing to atherosclerosis. So to not want to know that, when it's genetically determined, right, this is something that, you're born with this and you only need to really check it once, why we wouldn't want to know that in a 20-year-old, when it can contribute to a lot of the early atherosclerosis we see in people. It's leaving money on the table, in my opinion. The frequency with which you need to test really comes down to the state of interventions. I don't think it makes sense to just do blood tests for the sake of doing blood tests. There has to be kind of a reason. Is something changing? You know, a blood test is, for the most part, a static intervention. It's a look at a window in time. And there's benefit in having a few of those over the course of a year, if you're unsure about a level. So if something comes back and it doesn't look great, yeah, it might make sense just to recheck it without reacting to it. But typically, you know, in patients, we might check blood two to four times a year, but we're also probably doing things in there to now check, like hey, you know, we gave this drug, did it have the desired outcome? You put on three pounds of muscle and lost three pounds of fat, did it have the desired outcome? - Speaking of tracking weight and fat,"}
{"question": "Can binaural beats be used to help people relax and fall asleep, and if so, what is the most effective frequency range for this purpose?", "doc_id": "JVRyzYB9JSY_8", "video_id": "JVRyzYB9JSY", "video_title": "The Science of Hearing, Balance & Accelerated Learning", "video_header": "Binaural Beats: Do They Work?", "segment_idx": "8", "time_start": "35:37", "time_end": "43:49", "context": "not just auditory information, but anything faster. I get a lot of questions about so-called binaural beats. Binaural beats, as their name suggests, involve playing one frequency of sound to one ear and a different frequency of sound to the other ear. So it might be doomed, doon, doon, doon to your right ear, and it might be to ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding to the left ear. And the idea is that the brain will take those two frequencies of sound and because the pathways that bring information from the ears into the brain, eventually crossover, they actually share that information with both sides of the brain, that the brain will average that information and come up with this sort of intermediate frequency. And the rationale is that those intermediate frequencies place the brain into a state that is better for learning. And when I say better for learning, I want to be precise about what I mean. That could mean more focus for encoding or bringing the information in. As you may have heard me say before, we have to be alert and focused in order to learn. There is no passive learning unless we're little tiny infants. So can binaural beats make us more focused? Can binaural beats allow us to relax more if we're anxious? I know some people, they go to the dentist and the dentist offers binaural beats as they drill into your teeth and give root canals and things of that sort, probably causing some anxiety just describing those things right now. But those are available in many dental practices. Binaural beats have been thought to increase creativity, or at least they have been proposed to increase creativity. So what does the scientific data say about binaural beats? There are a number of different apps out there that offer binaural beats. There are a number of different programs. I think you can also even just find these on YouTube and on the internet. But typically, it's an app and you'll program in a particular outcome that you want: more focused, more creative, fall asleep, less anxious, et cetera. So what does the scientific data say? So believe it or not, the science on binaural beats is actually quite extensive and very precise. So sound waves are measured, typically, in hertz or kilohertz. I know many of you aren't familiar with thinking about things in hertz or kilohertz. But again, just remember those waves on a pond, those ripples on a pond. If they're close together, then they are of high-frequency. And if they're far apart, than they are of low frequency. So when you hear more hertz, what you're essentially hearing is higher frequency. And so if it's many more kilohertz then it's much higher frequency than if it's fewer hertz or kilohertz. And so you may have heard of these things as delta waves or theta waves or alpha waves or beta waves, et cetera. Delta waves would be big, slow waves, so low frequency. And, indeed, there is quality evidence from peer-reviewed studies that are not sponsored by companies that make binaural beat apps that tell us that delta waves like one to four hertz, so very low frequency sounds, think Costello's snoring, can help in the transition to sleep and for staying asleep. And that theta rhythms, which are more like four to eight hertz can bring the brain into a state of subtle sleep or meditation, so deeply relaxed, but not fully asleep. And then you can sort of ascend the staircase of findings here, so to speak. And you'll find evidence that alpha waves, eight to 13 hertz can increase alertness to a moderate level. That's a great state for the brain to be in for recall of existing information. And that beta waves, 15 to 20 hertz are great for bringing the brain into focus states for sustained thought or for incorporating new information and especially gamma waves, the highest frequency, the most frequent ripples of sound, so to speak, 32 to 100 hertz for learning and problem-solving. Now, all of this matches, or I should say, maps onto what I've said before about learning really nicely, which is that you need to be in a highly alert state in order to bring new information in, in order to access a state of mind in which you can tell your brain or the brain is telling itself, okay, I need to learn this. This is why stress and unfortunate circumstances are so memorable is because our brain gets into a really high alert system. Here, we're talking about the use of binaural beats in order to increase our level of alertness or our level of calmness. Now that's important to underscore because it's not that there's something fundamentally important about the binaural beats. They are yet another way of bringing the brain into states of deep relaxation through low frequency sound or highly alert states for focused learning with more high-frequency sound. So they are effective and I'll review a little bit of the data in detail, they're effective, but it's not that they're uniquely special for learning. It's just that they can help some people bring their brain into the state that allows them to learn better. So there are a lot of studies that allowed us to arrive, or I should say allowed the field to arrive on these parameters of slow, slow, low frequency waves are going to bring you into relaxed states, high frequency waves into more alert states. There's very good evidence for anxiety reduction from the use of binaural beats. And what's interesting is anxiety reduction seems to be most effective when the binaural beats are bringing the brain into delta, so those slow big waves like sleep, theta and alpha states. And I'll link to a couple of these studies although I will probably link more to the list that really segregates them out one by one so you can see them all next to one another. There's good evidence that binaural beats can be used to treat pain, chronic pain. There's three studies in peer-reviewed journals which I took a look at, and they seem to be of good quality, not sponsored research, as we say, not paid for by any specific company. Binaural beats have been shown to modestly improve cognition, attention, working memory and even creativity. But the real boost from binaural beats appears to be for anxiety reduction and pain reduction. Some people might find these beneficial for these oral surgeries, right? Believe it or not, there are people who would rather have the entire root canal or cavity drilled without Novocaine. And that's because they sometimes have a syringe phobia or something of that sort or they just don't like being numb from the Novocaine, or maybe there's an underlying medical reason. But I think most people do don't enjoy getting their teeth drilled even if they have Novocaine in there or a root canal. And so it seems that binaural beats can be effective in that environment. And you don't have to go into that sort of extreme environment to benefit from binaural beats. Binaural beats are a either relatively inexpensive thing to access, most of the apps are pretty inexpensive. I don't have a favorite binaural beats app to recommend to you. I confess I did use binaural beats a few years ago. I shifted over to other what I call NSDR, non-sleep deep rest protocols in favor of those, but many people like binaural beats and say that they benefit from them, especially while studying or learning. I think part of the reason for that relates to the ability to channel our focus when we have some background noise. And this is something I also get asked about a lot. Is it better to listen to music and have background noise when studying or is it better to have complete silence? Well, there's actually a quite good literature on this as well, but not so much as it relates to binaural beats, but rather whether or not people are listening to music, so-called white noise, brown noise; believe it or not, there's white noise and there's brown noise, there's even pink noise and how that impacts brain states that allow us to learn information better or not. So now I'd like to talk about white noise"}
{"question": "What are some of the different types of meditation practices and how can I choose the right one for my specific goals, such as improving focus or sleep?", "doc_id": "wTBSGgbIvsY_0", "video_id": "wTBSGgbIvsY", "video_title": "How Meditation Works & Science-Based Effective Meditations | Huberman Lab Podcast #96", "video_header": "Meditation", "segment_idx": "0", "time_start": "0:00", "time_end": "4:07", "context": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, we are discussing meditation. We are going to discuss the science of meditation, that is, what happens in the brain and body while we are meditating, and we will talk about the science of meditation as it relates to how the brain and body change as a consequence of meditation, that is, what you export or take from a meditation practice that can impact everything from your sleep to your mood. For instance, meditation has been shown to alleviate symptoms of depression. And we will also talk about how meditation can be used to enhance focus and other states of mind that are useful for work and other aspects of life. Now, of course, most of you have probably heard of meditation, and when we think of meditation, most often, we think of somebody either sitting or lying down. If they're sitting, we might imagine them in the so-called lotus position, you know, sitting with legs crossed, very upright, with hands on the knees or, you know, crossed in our lap or something of that sort. Typically, we think of somebody who is in a very calm state, eyes closed, focused on their so-called third eye center. The third eye center is the area just behind one's forehead. There's no third eye there, at least there shouldn't be, but I'll tell you why it's called the third eye center and what the origins of that are and why it's relevant, actually, for a meditative practice. With all that said, it turns out that meditation encompasses a huge variety of different practices. Some of those practices indeed are done sitting or lying down with one's eyes closed, focusing on the third eye center. Other of those practices are focused on a body scan, you know, really focusing on one area of the body and its contact with whatever surface you happen to be sitting or lying on or can be done walking. In fact, there are walking meditations done with eyes open. So there are many different forms of meditation, but today, we are going to focus mainly on how specific types of meditation and specific areas of the brain that are activated during those meditations change our way of being in fundamental ways, not just during the meditation practice, but afterwards as well. So if you're somebody who's interested in changing your default state of mood or of thinking or enhancing your ability to focus or improving your sleep or improving performance in some cognitive or physical endeavor, meditation is powerful, but you want to make sure that you pick the right meditation practice. So we will talk about picking a meditation practice that isn't just feasible because you'll do it but is actually directed at the goals specific to you and what you need most. So to give you some sense of the contour of today's episode, first, I'm going to talk about some of the underlying biology, the mechanisms and the brain areas and also the areas of the body that are activated during certain forms of meditation, and, equally important, which areas of the brain and body are shut down or reduced in their activity during specific types of meditation. Then I'll transition into how to best do a meditation practice, how to get the most out of that meditation practice, and then I will talk about how to change or alter your meditation practices according to your specific goals and as you get better at meditation. And this can get a little bit counterintuitive, but in a positive way. What I mean by that is, for instance, a lot of people think that as you meditate and get better at meditating, you need to meditate more and more and more, sort of like if you get better at running endurance races that you need to keep running longer and longer, you know, first a 5K, then a 10K, then a marathon, then ultras. With meditation, it's actually quite the opposite. The better that you get at dropping into a particular brain state and the more your so-called traits of brain state shift, not just states as they're sometimes referred to, but traits, this is a theme that I've picked up from a terrific book that I'll refer to later, but the more that you can get into specific neural circuits quickly, actually, the less you need to meditate in order to derive the benefits of meditation. So that's a wonderful aspect of meditative practices that's unlike a lot of other forms of mental exercise and cognitive enhancing exercises. So we'll talk about all of that today, and I promise that by the end of today's episode, you will have a rich array of meditative practices to select from, you'll know why each of them work and why they can be directed toward particular goals and how to do that,"}

And I can turn up the frequency, I can turn up the intensity, all with the radio frequency and control, and then it's reprogrammed or redosed, and then the patient can then leave at this altered dose. - So this is happening now? - This is happening right now, electrically. - You do this routinely? - I do it routinely in my clinic, electrically, yeah. - And you're getting the verbal content, which as you described earlier, is the indication of how well something is working in real time? - Yes. - So this is what, maybe you could just describe a little bit of the interaction with that particular patient or another patient, what's a typical arc of narrative as you go from no stimulation to increased stimulation? - In most patients, the actual therapeutic effects, the benefits actually take many days to weeks, and so what I'm mostly focusing on in the office in real time, is making sure I'm in a safe, low side effect regime. And so first I talk to the patient who has been on a particular dose of the stimulation for weeks or longer, and I talk about symptoms, how were things over the past month? How was your hope? How was your energy level? Sleep? What is your mood? And then we talk with the patient and we decide, well, this is not yet where we'd like to be. And so then, I can turn up the intensity of the stimulation in real time in the office. In most patients, I don't expect an immediate mood change. What I do, is I increase the dose until a next level up, while asking the patient for side effects. Can you still breathe? Okay. Can you still swallow? Okay. And I can hear their voice as well. And I can get a sense- - And you're looking at their face? - And I'm looking at their face. - Yeah. - And so I can get a sense, am I still on a safe side effect regime?

Now you could take a single blood sample and measure many biological components and figure where you are in the circadian clock. Something that was very hard to do before. So if you have a marker to know where you are in the clock, you could actually understand more the effect of everything; exercise, feeding, light input. - What is the marker? - So there are some papers from what's her name? Phyllis Zee and from Achim Kramer where they measure multiple RNAs that are known to tell you what phase of the clock is, or multiple proteins or biological reactions. And depending on a combination of factors, not a single factor, you could tell where you are in the circadian clock. So they could instead of just measuring temperature or melatonin, just one measurement. And melatonin specifically, is also complicated by the fact that melatonin is affected by light. And temperature, your temperature and sleep can be easily dissociable, right? When you travel up those different timezone, you sleep at different times in the temperature cycle. So having multiple components measured will give you a better determination of your circadian phase, and understanding your circadian phase in humans will telling you what is the effect of giving certain drugs at certain times of the circadian phase. So, in the future, this is going to be studied at a much higher level when you can determine the phase in relation to all the other stuff. - It's striking to me that in all animals, besides humans,"}
{"question": "What are some common triggers that can lead to anxiety or stress related to eating, and how can developing methods to calm oneself in the presence of anxiety or fear inducing stimuli, such as mindfulness meditation, help individuals with eating disorders or those who struggle with healthy eating?", "doc_id": "2XGREPnlI8U_28", "video_id": "2XGREPnlI8U", "video_title": "Healthy Eating & Eating Disorders - Anorexia, Bulimia, Binging", "video_header": "Healthy Eating Revisited", "segment_idx": "28", "time_start": "2:05:48", "time_end": "2:10:50", "context": "These are topics that frankly no one really wants to talk about unless they know someone who is suffering from them, or they themselves suffer from them. What I've tried to do today is try and give you a window into what really underlies these things that we call eating disorders. I hope I've done that at the level of biology neurocircuitry mechanism endocrinology, and some of the psychology, as with any episode of this podcast. But especially in this month where we're talking about mental health issues and mental health disorders, behavioral disorders, there's no way that I can exhaustively cover all the different forms of treatment. You have the modely approach, you've got all these different approaches to depression, into anorexia, et cetera. What I've tried to do is give you a framework. And in doing that, I've tried to give you a framework of understanding that also applies to this question. That's I think equally important and goes alongside the treatment of eating disorders is what in the world is healthy eating. What in the world is a healthy relationship to food. I like to think that I have a healthy relationship to food. I know the foods I like. I enjoy them. They're 10 or 15 foods in particular that I liked very much. I've mentioned a few of them on the podcast before, and I was sort of amused, surprised and perplexed as to why. For instance, I do enjoy eating butter, not in huge amounts, but I do like butter. So, that seemed to be pretty triggering for folks out there. A small selection of people decided that the ingestion of butter was a health concern. Look to me, ingesting butter in small quantities is something that I'm comfortable with. And my blood lipid profiles feel good. They look good to me. For other people that might not be the case. For some people. The idea of eating an animal-based food is probably so repulsive that it actually can make them feel physically sick. And I think that we should be aware that that kind of mental phenotype exists. I'm not calling it a pathology for other people like myself, things like butter and meat feel healthy. Now, what quantities? Well, I enjoy eating very much. I'm not shy about this. I've talked about on the podcast before, I enjoy eating. Some people have a very complicated relationship to food. They don't think of it as nourishment. They don't enjoy it socially. It's a stressful thing for them based on their personal history, or maybe just general anxiety around food. And I hope that in sharing this information about the fact that anytime we approach food, these neurons in our hype, in the arcuate area of our hypothalamus actually increase our levels of anxiety. This is related to that point that Dr. Halpern made, which was that from an evolutionary standpoint, it is advantageous to ingest as much food as often as possible, as quickly as possible. We now know that to not be healthy in this age of abundance, where calories are essentially everywhere. And yet a lot of people feel anxious in anticipation of a meal. What could be useful to them? Well, whether or not they have an eating disorder or not. It's very clear that developing methods to calm oneself in the presence of any anxiety or fear inducing stimulus can be beneficial. I've talked about some of these episodes related to stress, things like the physiological side to inhale through the nose and a long exhale, things like mindfulness meditation certainly can help. There are data, a lot of studies out there showing that meditation practice can help people deal with eating related anxiety and disorders. I think as a general rule, trying to avoid approaching a meal or sitting down to eat in an anxious state is probably a good idea, but let's be realistic. How often can we do that? I think most of us are going to have circumstances where we're rushing around trying to just eat before we head out or get to a meal. And then we sit down and we find ourselves eating. This is one of the first times in human evolution where we mostly eat out of a desire to consume food, not out of a need for food. Most everybody could go a fairly long period of time, just ingesting water and electrolytes. And not that I'm suggesting people do that, but let's face it. We largely eat nowadays because of a desire to eat, not a need to eat, and yet we need to eat on a fairly regular basis. And so no topic is more complicated and nuanced than food and nutrition. And in particular, as it relates to eating disorders. So, the major takeaways today are, we should all be asking the question, what is healthy eating for us? How do we develop a relationship to food that we can enjoy food, hopefully both socially and on our own, but that we are not neurotic and compulsive about it. For those of you that intermittent fast, this also applies, right? What, you know, God forbid, if you eat 30 minutes before your eating window starts, what does that mean? If it means something catastrophic, do you have an eating disorder? I don't know. Maybe you have an anxiety disorder, that's for you to explore. If you don't manage to eat five meals a day and that's your obsession. Well, then, you know, the same thing applies. These are questions that we can all ask ourselves. Today, we focus on the extremes of food related behaviors that really qualify as genuine disorders."}

"time_start": "1:34:08", "time_end": "1:40:17", "context": "describing an example of referenced pain so my understanding of referenced pain is that you know like for instance I I've got a slight bulge at I think like my lumbar 34 disc or something I had a whole body scan recently just a um an exploration scan because I had the opportunity not not anything serious fortunately and there's a slightly bulg disc there and every once in a while if I do certain movements um in the gym I'll get pain down in my right hip and sometimes going down my leg and I used to think it was sciatica because you assume anything on the right backside okay must be wallet induced SC sciatica back pocket wallet induced sciatica um but what I eventually realized is that well it's this dis buul it just so happens that the nerves that emit from that that region um they Branch out to a bunch of different areas and so you think the pain is in your leg but the the issue is someplace else or um and occasionally indeed I feel the pain elsewhere in my body as well it's sort of like a like a matching of regions for pain that seem unrelated is that a way to think about reference pain perfectly the the the examples also I referred to of a heart attack causing referred pain or also the pelvic region associated with back pain as a way of um referred pain um what you're describing is the fact that pain doesn't have to start with an injury or a stimulus in the periphery you could damage the nerves anywhere along the way and that will be perceived as pain we refer to that as neuropathic pain pain so that's another distinction you brought up uh nicely good good segue into there's thought to be um several different types or categories of pain we have been talking through much of this time about somatic pain you know injury out here we talked about visceral pain and when you have damage to a peripheral nerve damage injury to a peripheral nerve or the central nervous system we refer to that as neuropathic pain it frequently has different qualities different characteristics people will refer to it as shooting stabbing shock likee burning it can frequently uh when there's a damage to a nerve or damage to certain regions of the brain be incredibly challenging to treat by the way the good news is with that uh light disc bulge is the vast majority of time the discs reabsorb yeah I have to be careful to not do too much um spinal uh flexion like sit-ups and stuff I thought that that would help but that actually doesn't strengthen the back it was actually a asymmetry between the abdominal muscles and the lower back muscles so provided I do a lot of back extension type training then that bulge more or less stays in I just have to be a little little cautious not too cautious fortunately as long as we're talking about referenced pain somatic visceral and all the rest what about associative or referenced pain where it's psychological and I don't want to get tooo abstract here but more and more these days I hear from people who say you know I was in this job and the job sucked or I was in this relationship and the relationship sucked and I had terrible back pain like really acute localized back pain or chronic headaches or migraines yeah and then they go on vacation or they change their circumstances and lo and behold the pain goes away does that surprise you as an expert in pain not at all not at all what you're you know simp simplistically referring to is you know there's people are undergoing stress and we have we clearly know that the brain is not a passive recipient of information coming in from the body it's a two-way street the brain is causing Downstream consequences in the body the brain uh controls our sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system the sympathetic being the fight andlight response it controls the tone of uh cortisol that's being released and we all know that in acute situations rapid increases of cortisol and um noradrenaline is keeps us away from the Lions and the Tigers and the bears oh my but in a chronic situation and uh Robert spolski as you know it's Stanford has built a career around chronic stress at least in part and very bad for us and so these chronic stressors impact the end organ the tissue and it's real pain it doesn't mean that we need to go get back surgery it means that probably we need to identify the stressors that are contributing to that and address those and we'll often find that in the scenarios you outline that the pain gets better um some of those targets are interesting um there's a lot of memory associated with pain this is where early life events occur and those early life events and injuries can sensitize us to Future vulnerability so I was in a car act bad car accident when I was 16 uh fortunate to walk away from it got bad Whiplash if I get stressed a lot of my pain manifests in my neck for me as a pain doc it's a signal to me that's like go work out go for a walk in the forest you know uh and take some time away from the computer again that's a simplistic message and my experience doesn't translate into everybody else but I'm just validating

{"question": "What are some non-physical activities, like chess, that can be used to explore multiple roles and increase neuroplasticity, as opposed to traditional forms of exercise like running or swimming?", "doc_id": "BwyZIWeBpRw_17", "video_id": "BwyZIWeBpRw", "video_title": "Using Play to Rewire & Improve Your Brain", "video_header": "Chess, Mental Roles, Novelty", "segment_idx": "17", "time_start": "1:27:36", "time_end": "1:32:46", "context": "Now for those of you that are also interested in non-physical or non-athletic forms of play that can really expand plasticity. There's some very interesting research about the game of Chess. I don't play the game of Chess. I've played a few times. I confess I don't know how to move all the pieces. So I'm not going to try and describe that here, but I've always wanted to learn Chess. And I think after reading some of the Peer Reviewed Research about chess and play and neuroplasticity, now I understand why there's a really nice paper published in the International Journal of Research in Education and Science in 2017. And the title of this paper is, \"Is Chess Just a Game or Is It a Mirror That Reflects a Child's Inner World?\" That's a very, a very intense title for a biologist like me, but this paper is so interesting because what it really points to is the fact that in a single game chess, you have at least as I understand two players, and those two players are moving pieces on the chess board, for which each piece can do different things, right? Can move in different ways under different scenarios, but they're different rules for different pieces. And so each player actually has to assume multiple identities during the same game. And each of those identities has different rules and ways of interacting. So in a way we can think of chess as one game, but actually chess is a kind of a substrate for exploring multiple roles for different characters. And this is quite a bit different than for instance, video games where somebody has their favorite video game player, or they have an avatar. And they're always in the same role. It's also quite a bit different for when you engage in any kind of play where you are yourself, you're just being you in that game. And so now I'm highly incentivized to explore chess. You see quotes out there, for instance, things like \"Chess is life or jiu jitsu is life.\" I always assumed that that meant that someone's entire life was chess or their entire life was jiu jitsu for instance, but in reading over the research about chess in particular, but at also certain forms of martial arts, also certain forms of dance. What one finds is that indeed those games are life in the sense that they involve adopting multiple roles and exploring contingencies in a number of different ways. So there are some games that allow you to explore a much vaster landscape of movements or of mental roles or of ways of engaging in strategic movement as is the case with chess. And so when you hear that, you know, activity blank is life. It often reflects the passion for that activity, but I think looked at differently. It also reflects the fact that that activity is a portal through which you can explore life through many, many different lenses. And I think that that's especially powerful in terms of thinking about how play can be leveraged for plasticity. So for those of you that are interested in leveraging play for neuroplasticity and expanding your mind, if you will, I highly recommend picking an activity that will allow you to adopt different roles within that activity where it's not rigidly linear. This is actually a way in which I start to depart from this modern and important, but somewhat narrow idea. That exercise is the only route to plasticity. Yes, it's true. I have Nobel Prize winning colleagues that swim for two miles a day and have done on that for a long time. And they will tell you, I always think more clearly after my swimming and I certainly in my experience after a good run or a good workout, my mind seems to work best. Unless of course, that workout was very, very intense. I've talked about this before. If you do work out very, very hard in whether or not it's aerobic or resistance training or sport of any kind, you brain won't function as well afterwards, mostly because of the diversion of oxygen to tissues away from your brain, you actually are getting less oxygen to your brain, but in general, most of us feel that if we exercise regularly, our brain functions better. But there are activities that extend beyond linear exercise, beyond just generating the same sets of movements over and over again, when or not it's exercise or not. And that's really what play is. Play is about dynamically exploring different kinds of movements, dynamically exploring different kinds of thoughts, dynamically exploring different kinds of roles that one could adopt. And that is the way that the brain learns new things. So I encourage you to explore chess. I intend to learn chess this year. I'm very excited to do that. Now, if you already play chess and you are an expert chess player, you actually will derive less benefit in terms of this play induced neuroplasticity than you would, for instance, if you went out, and I don't know, played a game of soccer or did something that was very novel for your nervous system, because in that novelty and in that exploration of new behaviors and new ways of thinking, you are opening the portal to plasticity, whereas in doing what you already know how to do and trying just to perform better and better at it, you will get better at chess, but again, that's just chess. You are not expanding the realms in which you can become more plastic, that you are able to learn new things in relationship, in life, in finance and friendship, et cetera."}

I'd be remiss if I didn't say that, because blood flow is so critical for the neurons of the eye, remember, these are the most metabolically active cells in your entire body, the cells within your retina, because blood flow is required to get them the energy and nutrients they need, having a healthy cardiovascular system, right, doing endurance work, doing strength training work regularly, is going to support your eyes, and your brain, and your vision.

{"question": "What are some examples of how high levels of aggression can manifest in individuals, particularly in the context of collaborations or professional relationships, and how this can be destructive to both personal and professional success?", "doc_id": "qPKd99Pa2iU_21", "video_id": "qPKd99Pa2iU", "video_title": "Dr. Paul Conti: How to Improve Your Mental Health | Huberman Lab Guest Series", "video_header": "Generative Drive; Strong Aggressive Drive & Envy", "segment_idx": "21", "time_start": "2:10:02", "time_end": "2:21:47", "context": "to distinguish it from the other drives is to say that generative drives are pro social, meaning they tend to bring about benevolent interactions between people in. Paul Conti: The sense that pro social as constructive, right? In a sense, building goodness, then yes, because it's the drive in us that makes us want to love and nurture things. That makes us want to learn and sometimes learn to make better in the world or learn for learning's sake. The drive is a drive of goodness. So if the drive is then going to enact itself in the world around us, it's going to be pro social, because we exist as social units. I mean, if we decide, oh, I want to be an island off somewhere, that's not healthy, right? We exist in social units from small, like a nuclear family to a neighborhood, all the way up to nations and to the planet. So if we perceive the truth of that, that, hey, there's an interdependence between me and others, and I see that then the drive will lead to choices and behaviors that are socially constructive. Andrew Huberman: Earlier, you talked about aggression, and you were clear to make sure that we all understood that aggression does not necessarily mean violent aggression, that there are different forms of aggression. I'm curious if you could give us some examples of how you've observed people with high levels of aggression and high levels of pleasure drive as well, both male and female, and here, without defaulting to stereotypes. I think a lot of people just despite the fact that you've clarified what aggression is and isn't in the context of this conversation, we hear the word aggression and we think verbal attack, physical attack. However, the way you're describing aggression and the aggressive drive, I have a feeling that you're referring to other expressions of aggression as well. Paul Conti: So if the aggressive drive is running too high, and that could have factors of nature, factors of nurture, factors of the situation the person is in, factors of their whole life, but it ends up at the moment in a place that is too high, then what that person is doing in one way or another is to try and exert an unhealthy level of control. And that can be done in so many different ways. It can be done in that overt way of just intimidating people. Of using harsh language towards people. It can be done by manipulating people. It can be done through passive aggression. There are all sorts of ways that the person can try and exert unhealthy control, but that's where we end up. If there's too much expression of the aggressive drive in us, Andrew Huberman: That makes sense. And it reminds me of an example from my own life, where, first off, I should say I've had almost exclusively positive collaborations among my colleagues at Stanford and elsewhere. Every one of those collaborations has ended in a paper that we were all happy with. But more importantly, the relationships grew and were not diminished. But I had one collaboration with someone, not to be named, where it was going very well, but I had the need to reschedule an appointment. So I sent ahead a note about the fact that my car dealing with. I had some other things. I explained why I need to reschedule the appointment and didn't receive a reply, which was a little unusual, but then eventually received a reply that said, well, it's clear that you don't want to pursue this collaboration, which is like the furthest thing from the truth, right? And so I expressed that, and then the collaboration was reinstated. But it brought to mind some concern for me because it was sort of an extreme reaction to something that happens among academics or anyone we get busy with. Things come up. It was important to tend to the car, that is. And then at some point later, they were late to a number of meetings. Okay, no big deal. We're academics, we tend to run late. That's typical of many academics. But then I was late once to a meeting, and they essentially left and wrote an email that said something of the sort, like, I've got my own great ideas, so I'm no longer interested in pursuing the collaboration. And I was pretty shocked, because there was nothing really outside the ordinary in terms of busyness and prefaceorial schedules, and there were other people involved, postdocs and things like that. And there was a great project to be worked out. So I remember being disappointed, but also really kind of surprised. But then when I mapped it back to the earlier example of the car incident, I thought, well, there's a real sort of lack of ability of this person to handle disappointment, and yet they're exerting or demonstrating rather some of the same behavior, of occasionally running tardy and these kinds of things. And I remember feeling like it was pretty aggressive. It's a pretty aggressive reaction to something that could have been handled with a conversation. Now, I must say I'm very grateful that the collaboration didn't proceed and it went elsewhere and it worked out great, and they're doing great and we're doing great, and so, no hard feelings, but it stands out to me as a pretty salient example of aggression, but not played out at the level of yelling or anything. There's a passivity in there, but then there's also kind of a kind of entitlement. And here, of course, I'm only looking at the other person's behavior. And I should acknowledge, I realize canceling, not good. Being late, not good. But listen, I'm a human being, and I... Paul Conti: You canceled once. You were late once. This isn't habitual. This is human stuff. Right? Andrew Huberman: Right. And a lot of good work had gone into the project, and there was a cost where, most importantly, the postdoc suffered because they weren't involved in these interactions at all. And yet the project halted at that point. So to me, that seems like an example of somebody who has a, well, strong, aggressive drive. And that's clear from that they are incredibly successful in the academic domain. And when disappointed, lashes back or is passive, one or the other. Is that what we're getting at here? Not surprisingly, perhaps, the person rarely publishes with other people. Paul Conti: Right. Andrew Huberman: Probably that doesn't make a very good collaborative partner. Paul Conti: Right. And it totally makes sense. Think about what you're describing here, which is some vulnerability in the person. There's some way in which the person doesn't feel good enough, no matter what this person has achieved. So then there's a sense of the need and the right to over control. So when you agree to work together, you didn't agree that I'll never have to cancel anything. Right? Sure. But the thought was different, the framing is different on the other end, that now we're going to work together. So I'm exerting significant control over you. And again, you're not aware of it. And maybe that he's not aware of it. Andrew Huberman: In this case, it was a she. Paul Conti: Okay, so I was thinking of someone different, but she has to have some deficit of self that results then in the reflexive need to over control. And think about the first response is a non response. Which is, that's aggression. But it's just passive aggression. The thought would be, well, you're worried something doesn't feel good in you because I didn't respond, which was true.. You're expecting a response, maybe you don't know. Did you get the email? What's happening? Is she mad? So it's sort of effective. It creates some consternation and some dissonance in you. Then on top of that, the person is willing to potentially, at that point, sacrifice the relationship. So you think about aggression now is not good. This excess aggression is not good for you. It also is clearly eclipsing the generative drive. Because it's not good for this person and their research. It's not good for this person and the postdocs in their lab. But the person is willing to accept that in the service of gratifying the excess in aggression. Now, so then you said something that then sort of made it okay. For the short term. Okay. Then the person feels gratified, like, whether you apologize or not, they took it as you've, to some degree, bowed down before me now, like, it'll be okay, at least for the short term. But then the next thing that happens actually does end the collaboration. So that's not good. And you say, even from a self serving perspective, that person was collaborating with you for a reason. She saw a benefit to the science that she's very, very interested in through the collaboration with you. But then let that all go in the service of what? In the service of the ego. Of, I don't feel good enough about myself. The response to that then, is a response of envy. That I don't like that you have the freedom to behave differently than I want you to. I don't like any of it. I don't like that I don't control you as much as I would like to. And ultimately, it's that envy that becomes destructive. So it's a setback for that person. It's destructive of the science that person was doing. It's destructive of the science that you were doing. So envy is destructive. And here, the high level of aggression, the aggressive drive, is at a very high place. It's exceeding the generative drive. The pleasure drive isn't high enough either, because there's not enough pleasure coming from the great science that's being done, right? So then the person is approaching the world through the lens of envy, right? They don't feel good enough. They want to exert that aggression through over control. And what they end up doing is destructive, right? And it's very clearly destructive. It's a great example because it's destructive of the science, which is ostensibly the reason that you're there, right? It's the reason you were there. But someone who needs to exert over control is there, not just for that reason. And then the other reasons can trump the generative reason that they're there. And that's how envy, when it is the product of aggression or pleasure seeking, being too high, always unfailingly creates destruction. And how different is that from agency and gratitude as active verbs. There's a sense of agency, but the agency isn't being exactly enacted, because if the agency is being enacted in the service of science or career or whatever it may be, that's not going so well, right. And the gratitude part isn't active. Like, my goodness, I'm here, I have this great career. I'm discovering things. I get to spend my life in science. I get to collaborate with you. There's so many things to feel good about. I have postdocs in my lab, right? I get to nurture them because I know more and I can guide. That's not leading. Envy is not those things, which is why people who are doing that, at least in this realm of life, although this often this bleeds into other realms of life, the vast majority of times you see, is someone who does not have happiness in the way that happiness with the quotes. That happiness is the sense of peace, the sense of well being, right? Being able to delight in things, contentment. The person doesn't have that. And here it's interesting, right? This person gets to the highest levels of academia, and they're very successful, and they have a lab of their own, and they're collaborating. You think that's all great, right? But not inside of them. It's not bringing them those things, as evidenced by how this person is behaving. And I would bet almost 100% if you say, what's that person like in other aspects of life, at least in the professional realm, probably in others, too. No one's going to describe a happy person. Andrew Huberman: So much of what you just said captures this individual extremely well."}
{"question": "How can taking regular breaks of 5 minutes to relax my eyes and look at the horizon outside actually improve my focus and productivity during work sessions?", "doc_id": "Ze2pc6NwsHQ_11", "video_id": "Ze2pc6NwsHQ", "video_title": "Optimizing Workspace for Productivity, Focus, & Creativity", "video_header": "45 min / 5 min Rule", "segment_idx": "11", "time_start": "42:20", "time_end": "44:20", "context": "For every 45 minutes in which you are focusing on something like a phone or a tablet or a book page or your computer, you want to get into magnocellular panoramic vision for at least five minutes. And the way that I suggest to do this is actually to take a walk, ideally outside. We're going to talk about ambulation, about movement and about how that can maintain alertness throughout the day. So for every 45 minutes or so, try and get five minutes of relaxing your eyes. This is something that's not often done, especially in today's homeschooling and where kids are going to school by Zoom and adults are working by Zoom, this is a serious problem. People are getting eye fatigue, they're getting headaches. Indeed, some people are getting migraines, they're having all sorts of issues, neck pain. Much of that, if not all of that, in some cases can be alleviated by this 45 to five rule. For every 45 minutes of focused work that you do, get five minutes where you get outside, or if you have to be indoors where you can dilate your gaze. Now some of you may be saying, well, that spits in the face of your 90 minute rule. You've told us before that we should focus for 90 minutes. I would still want you to take breaks within those 90 minutes, if you're looking at a narrow piece of visual world, meaning at a phone or a laptop or so forth, and again, the best way to do this would be to go outside, just relax your eyes, look off into the distance. Looking at a horizon will automatically trigger this panoramic gaze, which is very relaxing to the eyes and will allow you to go back into a focused work about. The one thing you absolutely do not want to do is to go outside and check your phone, because if you're outside checking your phone or you're taking a break and checking your phone, you're still in that vergence eye movement. So this is very, very important because vergence eye movements increase focus and attention, and you can exploit that to increase focus and attention when you want to, but you absolutely need to relax the system, again for every 45 minutes in which you've been in that focused mode, you want to get at least five minutes of panoramic vision. If you can take a 15 minute walk, even better. Next, I'd like to talk about an aspect of workspace optimization that can actually bias"}
{"question": "Can omega-3 fatty acid supplementation help reduce sugar cravings and improve focus in individuals with ADHD?", "doc_id": "VAEzZeaV5zM_16", "video_id": "VAEzZeaV5zM", "video_title": "Controlling Sugar Cravings & Metabolism with Science-Based Tools | Huberman Lab Podcast #64", "video_header": "ADHD, Omega-3s", "segment_idx": "16", "time_start": "1:22:42", "time_end": "1:30:13", "context": "as well as food intake overall and steer us towards healthier choices. I'd like to talk about some of the special populations out there that might want to be especially wary of having a dysregulated sugar appetite system. And the group I'm referring to specifically are those with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or, I should say, and/or, people who have issues with focus and attention, generally. And I think more and more nowadays, I'm hearing that people are having a hard time focusing. This probably has something to do with our interactions with electronic devices. As I always say, if a picture is worth a thousand words, a movie is worth a million pictures, and the fact that we can access so any movies just by scrolling with our thumb, is something that the nervous system has just never contended with before in human history. I'm confident in that. And it's not that it can't deal with it, the question is what's the trade off? What are the consequences of that? So attention and ability to focus is obviously key to success in school, success in relationships, success in the workplace, and success in life. We could probably even go so far as to say one's ability to succeed in anything is proportional to one's ability to focus and then deliberately defocus when the time comes to defocus, right? 'Cause we all need rest and we need to disengage and then reengage, If you look at the sum total of the meta-analysis and the clinical data on ADHD and nutrition, you arrive at a pretty clear answer, which is that sugar consumption, in particular, highly refined sugars, is just not good for people with ADHD or with attentional issues. Now, as I say that, I also want you to recall the earlier study that I referred to, whereby the tuning of neurons in the brain is highly dependent on glucose. So this doesn't mean consuming no glucose is going to be a good idea. It doesn't mean that the ketogenic diet is necessarily the best diet for ADHD. Although there are some people pursuing that and exploring that, and we'll do yet another episode on ADHD at some point that go was a little bit deeper into that, because there's some new data. I did do a very long and fairly extensive episode on ADHD. You're welcome to look that up if you like in our archive, excuse me, in our archive at hubermanlab.com, it's all timestamped. So, you know, because the number of people said, oh, you know, it's an episode on ADHD and you made it two and a half hours long. Yes we did, because we wanted it to be as comprehensive as we could at the time. But it is timestamped, you can just jump to the particular topics of interest and there's short little cassettes there. Now, if you'd like to know upon what I'm basing this statement that sugar consumption and highly refined sugar consumption is potentially bad for ADHD, I'm basing this mainly on the conclusions of a really nice paper, the title of the paper is \"Sugar Consumption, Sugar Sweetened Beverages, and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.\" And this is a paper, we'll put a link to this in the caption. This was published in Complementary Therapies in Medicine which is a bit of an atypical journal in some sense. But I really like this meta-analysis. The sum total of this meta-analysis is really that when, especially kids, get beyond four sugary drinks per week, so four sodas of a typical 12 ounce soda, when they get past four 12 ounce sugary sodas, they didn't, as far as I know, look at artificially sweetened sodas. That's when you start to see a shift towards more negative outcomes, more symptoms of existing ADHD. Now where the controversy comes in is whether or not sugar consumption can actually trigger or cause ADHD. And I don't think we can conclude that at all at this time. And this review, if you decide to check it out, review/meta-analysis, I should say, if you decide to check it out, goes into some of the nuance around that. What's also interesting in terms of ADHD and sugar intake, and it probably has relevance to all of us, is that they also cover some of the interesting data showing that supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids can actually beneficial for people, in particular kids with ADHD, I've talked before about the utility of omega-3s, that's been shown in various studies that have compared omega-3 fatty acid intake to say prescription antidepressants, like SSRIs, like Prozac, Zoloft, and similar, Fluoxetine, and the results of those studies are pretty clear, at least to me, that provided that one gets at least one gram of EPA, essential fatty acids, so it's not just getting one gram per day, but one or more grams per day of the EPA form of essential fatty acid, can rival some prescription antidepressants and/or decrease the amount of antidepressants that's required to take. Which for a lot of people can be a very useful thing because of the side effect profile of many of those antidepressants. Of course, talk to your psychiatrist, talk to your doctor, but the omega-3s are no doubt powerful. And then of course there's a whole story about omega-3s and heart health. And of course, like anything else, there's some controversy around omega-3s, but I think the data are clear enough to me around mood and cardiovascular health, that certainly I personally ingest them. But as always, I always say, anytime you're going to add or remove anything from your nutrition, supplementation, exercise, or otherwise your lifestyle, definitely consult with a board certified physician. I don't just say that to protect me, I say that to protect you, you are responsible for your health ultimately. So omega-3 supplementation has been shown to be beneficial for ADHD. Why am I talking about this in the context of an episode on sugar and the nervous system? Well, if you remember those neuropod cells, those cells in your gut that respond to sugar and send signals up to the brain to cause the release of dopamine. Well, it turns out that neuropod cells also respond to amino acids and to fatty acids, in particular, essential fatty acids. So these cells that we call neuropod cells, have three jobs. One is to levels of sugar in the gut, the other is to detect levels of amino acids, and to detect levels of particular essential fatty acids, and communicate that information to the brain. And I should point out when I say communicate that information, they're not actually saying, hey, there's amino acids here, or hey, there's sugar here, or, hey, there's essential fatty acids, because the language of these cells is somewhat generic. It's just the firing of electrical potentials. But that's the key point, it's generic and all three or any of those three, sugar, essential fatty acids, or amino acids, will trigger these neurons to signal to the brain to increase dopamine. And it is not coincidental that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation can help ameliorate some of the symptoms of ADHD by way of presumably increasing dopamine in this neuropod to dopamine pathway that we talked about earlier. The whole thing has a very nice logical structure to it. And points to yet again, the immense value of bringing the proper amounts, maybe even supplementing the proper amounts of omega-3 fatty acids and the proper amounts of amino acids into the gut as a way to supplant some of the stimulation of these pathways that would otherwise be caused by sugar. There's actually a version of this where one could say, if you want to reduce sugar cravings, you might consider increasing certain forms of amino acid intake or certain forms of fatty acid intake. So what are some ways that we can reduce our sugar cravings, and ideally ways that we can do that,"}
{"question": "What is the optimal level of dopamine in the nigrostriatal pathway for engaging in divergent thinking, and how does it relate to mood and creativity?", "doc_id": "KPlJcD-o-4Q_12", "video_id": "KPlJcD-o-4Q", "video_title": "The Science of Creativity & How to Enhance Creative Innovation | Huberman Lab Podcast 103", "video_header": "Mood, Creativity & Dopamine", "segment_idx": "12", "time_start": "1:11:12", "time_end": "1:15:54", "context": "areas of the brain are active in each of these different . Meditation but what I can tell you is that there have been some beautiful what are called loss of function studies where particular brain areas are either depleted of dopamine or where dopamine in some cases I guess what we would call gain of function studies although not the gain of function studies associated with virology different gain of function studies where you enhance the level of dopamine in the brain. What you find is that both divergent and convergent thinking are enhanced when levels of dopamine are elevated. Now, we're not necessarily talking about pharmacology here. It turns out that there are other ways to elevate dopamine that make us better at divergent and convergent thinking in particular, by using mood. And now I'd like to talk about what mood you are in when you happen to start a creative process, or try and do a training such as open monitoring meditation or focused meditation. How your mood relates to your level of dopamine at baseline. What we call your tonic as it's called, meaning consistent or ongoing level of dopamine, how that dictates whether or not you are going to be better at one particular aspect of the creative process or another and how you can enhance your creativity in the very short term, very quickly using tools that are known to trigger additional release of dopamine, which in some cases is good and in some cases is bad, I should mention. And in other words, determine how you feel in one moment should dictate what tool you should use in order to become more creative. The relationship between mood and creativity is a fascinating one that is bridged by one main feature, which is the amount of dopamine present in this nigrostriatal pathway. And there's a really wonderful correlate or measure of the amount of dopamine that's active in that pathway that can be addressed noninvasively in the laboratory. As I mentioned, the nigrostriatal pathway is involved in movement and in eye blinking which, of course, is a movement. It's not a movement of the sort that we typically think of when we think of movements, but nonetheless it relies on dopamine levels in this pathway. And in fact, we can state very confidently that when dopamine levels are elevated, the blinking reflex is more active. People just blink more. When dopamine levels are lower or less active in this pathway, people tend to blink less. So blink frequency is a common measure in studies of dopamine within this pathway that relate to creativity. The work that I'm about to describe is largely the work of two authors who have done wonderful work across several papers. Unfortunately, for me their names are difficult to pronounce. So I apologize to them and their relatives for what is sure to be incorrect pronunciation. But the last names of these authors are Chermahini and Hommel. They're in the Netherlands. So Chermahini and Hommel done a number of different papers or studies rather of the relationship between blinking, mood, and creativity in particular, divergent thinking. What they found is that if people are blinking fairly often and they measure their mood through subjective tests and if they were to do brain imaging, which other studies have done, they find is that those people can engage in divergent thinking very easily. In other words, being in a good mood facilitates divergent thinking. Now, some of you might immediately say, well, duh, if you're in a good mood you can be more playful about the exploration about what could happen with these notes of music or these foods, et cetera. But it's not so obvious. Because it turns out that if your dopamine levels are very, very high, and this can be measured noninvasively through the frequency of blinks or it can be measured more invasively through brain imaging even through blood draws or other methods to measure dopamine. If dopamine levels are very, very high, what you observe is that divergent thinking is actually very, very poor. Now, a naturally occurring truly pathological example, this would be something like manic bipolar disorder where somebody is in the manic phase or somebody who has taken methamphetamine or cocaine, what tends to happen is that they have lots and lots of ideas, all of those ideas seem really exciting to them. But if you were to talk to them for any given moment, they would be very fixated on one particular tunnel of ideas. And by being fixated on one particular tunnel of ideas like the idea that they're going to run for president tomorrow, this is unfortunately typical of people who have bipolar, which is not to say that everybody who runs for president is bipolar rather people who are bipolar often have these delusions of grandeur that they're somehow going to be president simply because they decided to and that they were selected to do this, et cetera, et cetera. Ideas about themselves and other people that are very constrained. In other words, not very divergent. So divergent thinking is favored by having elevated levels of dopamine but not too high."}
{"question": "Is it possible to use social media in a way that is healthy and beneficial, rather than addictive and detrimental to our lives?", "doc_id": "p3JLaF_4Tz8_18", "video_id": "p3JLaF_4Tz8", "video_title": "Dr. Anna Lembke: Understanding & Treating Addiction", "video_header": "Social Media Addiction", "segment_idx": "18", "time_start": "1:40:25", "time_end": "1:51:24", "context": "It was a powerful movie. I think many people avoided seeing that movie because it reflects back on us just how addicted we all are and how manipulated we all are. - Yes. - But it doesn't seem to have changed behavior much. I have to say that the movie changed my understanding and my perception, but not my behavior too much. If we look at addiction as a maladaptive thing, something that's making our lives worse or us less functional at work and in relationships, I could imagine a version of social media where it's making me more connected. I mean this is a podcast after all. - Yes, yes. - I post videos. This will show up on YouTube and elements of it on Instagram as well. So much like sugar or other things, I have to imagine that we need to regulate, not necessarily eliminate, this behavior. So I want to talk about what that looks like. And I want to talk about what you've referred to as this narcissistic preoccupation that social media is creating. That we are all far more keenly aware of how we look and how we sound and how we are being perceived, than we were 10 years ago. - Right. - So first of all, social media, how addicting is it really? And what is healthy social media behavior? - So the first message I would want to get across about social media, is that it really is a drug and it's engineered to be a drug. And it's based on, you know, potency, quantity, variety, the bottomless polls, the likes, the way that it's enumerated, all of that. Which doesn't mean that we can't use it, but we need to be very thoughtful about the way we use it, just like we need to be thoughtful about the way we use any drug. And so that means with intention and in advance, planning our use, right. And trying to use it as a really awesome tool to potentially connect with other people, and not to be used by it or get lost in it. And of course, you know, people are going to come with different propensities for addiction to any drug, and that's true for social media too. Some people will have no problem using it in moderation or using it in a way that's adaptive. And other people will immediately get sucked in. And the key thing about getting addicted is when it's happening, nobody who's getting addicted thinks they're getting addicted, right. Let's face it, it's only after the fact that we go woops, you know, what was that about? - Remember texting and driving, there are all these books about texting and driving, how terrible it was. - Yeah. - Even the governments have largely given up. You see these billboards - Terrifying. - like don't text and drive, or any text can wait, or whatever. Not worth dying for. - Right, right. - But everybody's texting and driving. - Right and if you look at young people today, teenagers, I mean they're basically cybernetically enhanced, that the phone is there. You know, it's like they're talking to you and texting 12 friends at the same time, and there's no stopping it. I mean the genie is out of the bottle where, you know, we're not going back. - Right. - So we do need to figure out, you know, how to make this tool something that's, you know, going to be good for us and not ultimately harmful. And I don't have all the answers by any stretch of the imagination, but I do think, you know, some of the wisdom that we have learned from using other drugs, also applies to social media. Which is to say that we have to, again, put barriers in place that allow us to remain in control of our use, which means not too much, you know, not too often, not too potent. - Do you think in, going back to this idea of the unit of the day being a good attractable unit, a manageable unit of time for most people, so you're saying in advance, so allocating two hours in which you're going to allow yourself to have free reign use of the phone and all its apps and all its things, or even more restricted than that, meaning okay, I'm only going to allow myself 30 minutes a day to post and comment, and then that's a closeout completely. - Yeah, so I think it's, it depends on the person and sort of a combination. We talked earlier about, you know, having an itch and scratching yourself at night. We've gotten to a point with smartphones, people are pulling them out and they are utterly unconscious of doing so, pulling them out, you know, a couple of texts, a couple. They don't know they're doing it! - I have a friend who works in, delivers babies, and many pregnant mothers won't actually deliver without their phone in hand. And this used to be the hand that was connected to their spouse. This may be a comment on spouses more than on phones. But it sounds like it's a kind of a security blanket of sorts. - Right, like a transitional object, yeah. - Actually that reminds me, you've referred to the phone, I think it's the phone, but maybe it's our online persona or ourselves, as we've become sort of infantile in our need for, it's like a baby and a bottle. - Right, right. - And so I do wonder if we have regressed, and I do think we've regressed a bit in terms of our online behavior. Our inability to act like. I always thought an adult was somebody that can control their behavior. - Yeah. - That's the difference between a baby and an adult. You don't have to be a developmental neurobiologist for very long to understand that a young organism can't control its behavior, an older one can. So to me, a mature organism, mature in years organism that can't control its behavior, is a baby. It's an immature version of itself. And there's neuroscience to support that statement. I look at my own behavior with the phone sometimes and I think, I'm a grown man. Like what is the problem here, right? You know, I don't eat baby food, but I'm acting like a baby with the phone, all right, in the sense that I'm reflexively picking it up, I'm not being intentioned and deliberate with it. Do I need a full 30 days, Anna? - So yes, so- - 30 days away from my phone? - As you know, that's my recommend, the full 30 days to reset. If you're severely addicted, I recommend the 30 days. But if you're just a little bit addicted, like most of us, you probably don't need 30 days. In fact, a single day, not only would be challenging, but probably may be sufficient. - My phone is off for substantial segments of the day. - Okay, that's great. - And it drives other people crazy. People expect me to respond. But I don't care. - Yeah, right, right. - I really don't. And I actually take a little bit of pleasure in the fact that, well, because I think the point I'm trying to make is the right one, which is that it's not just right for me, but like why, I don't see a clause on text messages or emails that say must be responded to within X amount of time or else, or else. So I take the liberty of replying when I'm able to. - Yeah, that's right. - Or want to. - Right, which touches on one of the big challenges about social media, is that as more and more of us are spending more and more time on social media, we're divesting our libidinous energies, et cetera, from real-life interactions. So that means even when we want to choose to not be online connecting, we go outside and there's no there there, right. There's nobody else there. So I think our collective challenge, and it should be our mission, is to make sure that we are preserving and maintaining offline ways to connect with each other. 'Cause if we don't do that then we'll be very lonely, right, if we were not online. But if you have a tribe of folks that you can be with, none of whom are on their phones while you're together for that discreet amount of time, then it's wonderful and liberating and nobody's distracted. And I think that's really the key. And I think young people are figuring that out, you know. They're trying to create these spaces or try to, let's say, instead of doing a dopamine fast by yourself, do it with your friends, right. Then there's the FOMO is less, the fear of missing out because, oh you're all doing the dopamine fast together. So these are some of the tricks that we can come up with. - I like that. - Yeah, okay good. - I like that. I don't allow, I have a home gym and I love working out. I just enjoy it and always have. And I don't allow my phone in my gym anymore. - Right. - And I live in an area where I don't get any reception, like two meters outside my door. So all my dog walks now are just, and they were boring as hell. - Yes. - I also have a bulldog, he doesn't like to walk. It's really slow. And it was so boring for a while - Yes. - because I was so used to taking calls while I walk, - Right. - and it's super efficient when I do that. The walks now are some of my favorite part of the day, - Yeah, right. - because, and if the phone, if I were to get a call on one of those or they brought reception of the areas, I would be very dismayed. - Yeah, right. - So I can attest to this, and I don't think I'm a phone addict, but I do put work into regulating my phone behavior. - Yeah, so this is the key. You have to, with intention, prior to being in that situation, think of literal, physical and metacognitive barriers that you can put between yourself and your phone, or whatever your drug is, to create these intentional spaces where you're not constantly interrupting yourself, essentially, and distracting yourself, because I really do think, you know, I think we talked just before we started with the interview, you know, we're losing the ability to have a sustained thought, right? I mean we get so far and then, then you get to that point in the thought where it's a little bit hard to know what's coming next. And it's very easy to check your phone or check your email, or look something up on the internet. And then you never get that opportunity to finish that thought, which is really the source of creative energy and an original thought, right. You're not just reacting to what's coming at you. - Right, and something that could contribute to the world. - That's right. - I'm a big believer that you're either consuming or you are creating. And there is, I should mention, it's important, I do believe in neutral time. I think sleep is great. I'm a big proponent of sleep and I've talked a lot about it on the podcast, I care a lot about sleep. And not just for sake of performance. I actually just really like sleep. I think that being a constant consumer of visual information and information of all kinds, can be a problem. But there's some really great sources of information on the internet. - Yes. - And I certainly benefit from the fact that those channels exist. Narcissistic pre-occupation."}
{"question": "How much salt should the average person consume per day, according to Dr. James DiNicolantonio's book \"The Salt Fix\"?", "doc_id": "azb3Ih68awQ_17", "video_id": "azb3Ih68awQ", "video_title": "Using Salt to Optimize Mental & Physical Performance | Huberman Lab Podcast #63", "video_header": "General Recommendations for Salt Intake", "segment_idx": "17", "time_start": "1:32:29", "time_end": "1:36:32", "context": "how this all starts to become pretty dizzying, and yet it doesn't have to be dizzying. We can provide some useful ranges that, for most people, will work, and so let's talk about what those ranges are, and I'm going to point you to a resource that explores what those ranges are in these various contexts of nutrition, exercise, and so on. The resource is a book that was authored by Dr. James DiNicolantonio. He's not a medical doctor. He's a scientist, so he's cardiovascular physiology as well, I believe, as a doctor of pharmacy, and the title of the book is \"The Salt Fix.\" \"The Salt Fix\" is an interesting read because it points to, first of all, the history of salt in society and as it relates to health. It actually emphasizes some of the major missteps, maybe even pretty drastic errors, that have been made in terms of trying to interpret the role that salt has in various diseases and emphasizes some of the ways in which, perhaps, increasing salt can actually improve health outcomes, and I think it strikes a pretty nice balance between what's commonly known about salt and what I believe ought to be known about salt, or at least taken into consideration. The book does provide certain recommendations, and I actually reached out to the author. I've never met him in person or talked to him directly, and I asked him outright. I said, \"How much salt \"do you recommend people take on average?\" And he gave, of course, the appropriate caveats about prehypertension, hypertension, et cetera, but made a recommendation which I'll just share with you, and if you want to learn more about the support for this recommendation, you can check out his book. The recommendation he made was anywhere from 8 to 12 grams of salt a day, which corresponds to 3.2 to 4.8 grams of sodium, so going back to the current recommendations that we talked about before, 2.3 grams of sodium per day, this is about 1 1/2 times to double the amount of sodium that's currently recommended in most circles, and then, what this corresponds to is about 1 1/2 to 2 teaspoons of salt per day to arrive at that 3.2 to 4.8 grams of sodium. Again, this is the recommendation that was passed along for most people, most conditions, barring specific health issues. Now, what was also interesting is he pointed to a sodium-to-potassium ratio, which is 4 grams of potassium, and he also mentioned 400 milligrams of magnesium, and pointed out, and I generally agree here, that many people are deficient in magnesium, so again, that was a 3.2 to 4.8 grams of sodium, 4 grams of potassium. You might think, \"Well, gosh, \"that's 1 1/2 to 2 times the current recommendation,\" but we can go back to that study that was mentioned earlier in the episode, that 2011 study, where I describe this sort of J-shaped curve in which, when you look at the occurrence of these negative health events, they were fairly low at low sodium intake, lower still at slightly higher sodium intake, much in line with the recommendations that are made or that Dr. DiNicolantonio passed along to me, and then, they increased quite, those health risks increased quite substantially as one moves out past 6 grams of sodium, 7 grams of sodium per day. That's when things really do seem to get hazardous, and really, it makes sense, I think, given the consensus around this, to really avoid very high salt intake, so \"The Salt Fix\" describes the rationale behind those recommendations. \"The Salt Fix\" also describes, in quite beautiful detail, the relationship between salt intake, potassium intake, and the relationship to the sugar consumption system. I'd like to pick up on this idea of the relationship between salt and sugar because I think that one key aspect"}

"wgUjIRtote8_13", "video_id": "wgUjIRtote8", "video_title": "Dr. Teo Soleymani: How to Improve & Protect Your Skin Health & Appearance", "video_header": "Tool: Sun Exposure & Skin Health, Mood",

how much sun exposure is healthy for our skin I'm a big believer in getting sun exposure to the eyes early in the day blinking as needed to protect the eyes of course but in order to set one's circadian rhythm for elevated daytime mood focus and alertness and improv nighttime sleep there's just so much data to support setting one's circadian rhythm properly ly for sake of health and there's so much data to support the fact that sunlight viewing in particular is the best way to do that and sunlight viewing in the early part of the day in particular is the best way to do that but beyond that how much sun exposure to the skin is good for us is it zero is it five minutes does it depend great like great controversial question and it depends on which school of thought or Camp you belong in as a skin cancer surgeon and a somebody who's developed a reputation for seeing some of the worst most complicated life-threatening skin cancers in in Los Angeles obviously I see some of the consequences of long-term sun exposure and chronic chronic photo aging that being said I absolutely think that getting sun is healthy for us now why the studies that talk about vitamin D and we'll touch on vitamin D as its own entity and then overall health as another entity but most of the studies that look at Vitamin D synthesis from UV exposure on the skin suggest that you only need about 15 minutes and that you don't need a broad uh surface area of exposure you can get enough vitamin D formation with just about 15 to 20 minutes of sun on your forearms so there's a whole school of thought by a lot of experts who think there's no amount of UV exposure that's healthy for the skin and I tend to be on the other camp for several reasons one there's a component of feel goodness if that's a word from being in the sun that affect overall skin and physical biology when you're out in a sunny day you tend to be less stressed you tend to be a little happier now it's it's a generalization but most of the time when you get Outdoors you get outside and it's a nice sunny day you feel better and although you can't quantify that feeling better there are some parameters that can be measured decreases in core disol response improvements in skin appearance and texture um the other important thing about being out in the sun is finding out your own tolerance right so I have a little bit more olive skin and I can tolerate the a little bit longer than somebody who is fairer and lighter eyes in my opinion I don't think and in most of the evidence there isn't a finite amount of time because that time is dictated by your Skin's ability to tolerate the UV but I absolutely do not think that sun avoidance is a healthy thing and this is coming from somebody who operates on head and neck skin cancers literally every day I think there is a component of sun exposure that's not just for vitamin D synthesis but something that improves your overall Wellness that is visible and maybe not laboratory measurable but um you definitely are healthier when you're feeling better and you're happier I lived on the east coast in places that had lower uh days of sun and I had Seasonal effective disorder it bothered me my mood was lower I felt not as healthy you know I'd come home my family would say Hey you look sick and it just I wasn't sick I hadn't had any sun I was lighter than I was and my family interpreted that as not being healthy you know my wife on the other hand didn't she didn't mind the grayness so there's a timeline for biologic processes like vitamin D formation that's helpful people can argue that you can get it through supplementation and food and that's that's correct but there is a component of sun exposure that makes you feel better overall and provides some sort of Wellness that you may not be able to quantify but you see in appearance and in discussion and Longevity so absolutely I think you should be out the sun I don't think you should burn and I don't think you should be out long enough where your skin starts to turn red that's the first sign that you're reaching kind of critical mass in terms of UV exposure but I absolutely think the sun is a good thing for us so even midday Sun you know maybe if there's some cloud cover or if we have some sunscreen on or a physical barrier like sun and long uh excuse me like hat and long sleeves then getting some sun exposure in your mind is good for our overall well-being mood Etc yeah I think I mean midday sun has a higher UV index so you're more likely to burn and have a problem with prolonged exposure but yeah absolutely I think you know there's been numerous studies that that have looked at people who go out for a walk in you know busy Urban cities and work environments if they go out for a walk in the sun they feel better their stress responses are lower their questionnaires in responding to life stressors and day-to-day stressors are decreased there's a lot of studies that look at being outside as a measure of well-being mental health well-being um is improved with outdoor sun exposure so there's a lot of that now can I quantify it in the skin hard to say one thing we do know is that obviously too much sun exposure like anything too much of a good thing can be a bad thing but I really do think that being out in the sun for the amount that your skin can tolerate is a good thing I'd like to"}

I'm guessing if we looked hard enough, we'd probably find that there were other sources of androgens in females. Can we say that these general contours of effects on aggression also pertain to females? And I suppose I should ask in particular about female-female aggression, which does exist in many species, female-male agregression as well as maternal aggression, which is a robust aspect of our evolution, of course, that the mother will, an angry mother animal of any kind protecting her young is truly dangerous, in the best sense of the word. - And that type of post-parturition, period after birth aggression is all about estrogen, progesterone, those sorts of things. Female aggression, the rest of the time has testosterone as a major player at a much lower level on the average. On the average, one always has to say, but it's basically the same punchlines. In females, the lower levels of testosterone are essential for typical levels of aggression and sexual behavior. Nonetheless, they're not causing it, it's not sensitive to small individual differences. Same exact thing. You can get way over-impressed with the importance of androgens in females just as readily as in males. - So in line with that, how should we conceptualize testosterone?"}

Like there are other options of ways to be and to behave and to function and work in life. But if something is a compulsion, it yanks us away from those other opportunities, just enough that we have to get back to it. You've talked before about, and you talk in the book, this notion of the source. And to me, again, I can't help but put my neuroscientist lens on this. I think of the source as not one brain area but some function within the brain, where we are in touch with our bodily signals. Like what feels right, what doesn't? Or like tasting the two foods, I love that example. And that it's a playbook that is far more vast than the short term adaptive playbook, like this how I'm going to get from point A to point B. And yet, when I listen to an album or a song, I have to assume that there, at some point, it becomes not strategy development or creativity but strategy implementation. Like there needs to be the songs are going to come in this order-- and I don't know much about music. My musician friends are always laughing. RICK RUBIN: It's not so much about music. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. Well put, but the ordering of the sequence of the melodies, et cetera. So at what point does one decide, OK, like now's the time to get into that more narrow focus of effort? Like we've got it. Let's run with this. Because there is a component of the creative process that involves packaging and finishing. And is that part less satisfying to you, or is it just all part of the same larger arc? RICK RUBIN: It's all part of the same. It's nice. There's a good feeling. There's usually a good feeling when something is done. On the one hand, it's a commitment, because up until the time that you say it's done, you can keep experimenting and changing it. If you think, well, maybe tomorrow I can make it better, then it's not finished. And you keep thinking that for a long time, you can do that forever and never put out anything. So getting to the point where you're ready to sign off is a good feeling, and it allows you-- one of the things I talk about in the book is, because it is a difficult thing to do, because it's fun to play, and it's fun to maybe it's not the best it could be yet. To use whatever the next project is going to be as motivation to finish the one you're working on now. Like I'm working on this. I'm spending all of my time on this thing. It's really good. I believe it can be better, but there's this other thing that I really want to make. And if I keep tinkering with this one, I'll never get to make the other one. So using other projects as an impetus to finish something and release it into the world is a good one. And you said your description of source is something within us. I don't know if I would say that was accurate. It's definitely in us too, but it's not only in us. And it's I think of source as the organizing principle of everything, and it's how everything exists. How the trees grow, and why there are mountains. And anything that we can see in the outside world, and every discovery and every piece of art and every new design and every machine are all outgrowths of this source energy. Our part of it is the antenna that connects to it, and maybe where the vehicle for source to allow things to happen in the world. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And thank you for that, because I did indeed misspeak. Because I recall very distinctly in the book, you described how the physical world is constrained by the laws of physics and certain things. The imagination is unconstrained. And I think I have this right, that you said the work set somewhere between those, it's neither of one nor the other. That ultimately what feeds into all of that are imagination and the way, indeed, that our brain is a physical entity. The nature in the outside world provides at least what appears to be near infinite if not infinite options. And I love the example of the color palette. That if we restrict me to whatever sorts of paints or medium I have, then it's restricted. But in nature, there's an infinite number of shades and tones and combinations. RICK RUBIN: And even on one, if you pick up a rock and look at the color of the rock and tried to find a paint to match that rock, it would never match. There's too much. There are too many variations in nature within a single color rock for us to get close. There's too much information. We scratch the surface. We're only scratching the surface. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And we love when we are able to peer in at different scales, spatial scales, time scales too, but spatial scales, the delight that comes from that that these nature pictures-- seemed like there were more of these in the '80s, like where you'd see a drop of oil shot at very high resolution. There's beauty in a drop of oil. And then you'd see the Earth and the galaxy, there's beauty in that too, these extremes. And of course, our daily perception is mostly through the filter of these kinds of interactions, walls, and sometimes outdoors. There's a brilliant neuroscientist,"}
{"question": "What are the common characteristics or features of a healthy microbiome, and how can they be identified through microbiome analysis, given the vast complexity and individuality of the human gut microbiome?", "doc_id": "ouCWNRvPk20_6", "video_id": "ouCWNRvPk20", "video_title": "Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: How to Build, Maintain & Repair Gut Health | Huberman Lab Podcast #62", "video_header": "The Human Microbiome Project at Stanford", "segment_idx": "6", "time_start": "22:02", "time_end": "26:26", "context": "what is a healthy microbiome? What is it supporting? We hear that you need a healthy microbiome to support the immune system or metabolism, or even the gut-brain axis. How do we define a healthy, versus a unhealthy microbiome? Some people might know the unhealthy microbiome is dysbiosis is the word that I encounter in the literature. But given that there's so many species of microbiota, and given that I think we probably each have a signature pattern of microbiota, how do we define healthy versus unhealthy microbiota? Is there a test for this? Later we'll talk about technologies for testing microbiota. There are a lot of companies now, a lot of people sending stool samples in the mail. Never look at the Postal Service the same way again, but it's out there and it's getting analyzed. So how should I think about this? I can think about things like heart rate, heart rate variability, BMI, all sorts of metrics of health. How should I think about the microbiota? How do I know if my microbiome is healthy or unhealthy? - Yeah, it's a million dollar question right now in the field, and there's a lot of different ways of thinking about that, and I can talk about some of those. But I would say that there are sessions at conferences, there are review articles being commissioned. There are all sorts of thought pieces about this right now, like what is a healthy microbiota? What are the features that define it? And I think before diving into this, the important thing to realize is, it's a complex topic. Context matters a lot. What's healthy for one person or one population may not be healthy for another person or population. And the microbiota is malleable. It's plastic, it changes our human biology, which I think is, how we think about health quite often, BMI and longevity, reproductive success, however you want to define it. It certainly can accommodate a variety of configurations of gut microbiota, and we don't have... It's really hard to untangle all of the different factors of what could be very healthy, versus a little bit less healthy. So I will say that there's no single answer to this, but there's some really important considerations. And perhaps the best way to start talking about this is to go back to the inception of the Human Microbiome Project, which was this program that NIH started. They invested a lot of money in 2008, 2009 for really propelling the field of gut microbiome research. It was becoming evident at that point that this was not just a curiosity of human biology, that it was probably really important for our health. And they had all this wonderful sequencing technology from the Human Genome Sequencing Project, and with the human genome completed that point, they started turning that technology to sequencing our gut microbes. And it's important to contextualize the amount of information that they're trying to document, the collective genome of our gut microbes is on the order of 100 to 500 times larger than our human genome. So it's just in terms of the number of genes. So it's just this vast number of genes, and then if you start getting into some of the fine variation, it's scales by 10 to a 100 fold. So really a huge amount information they're trying to document. And so it was a wonderful investment, and it continues to pay dividends to this day. But one of their goals of that project was to try to define what a healthy microbiome is, versus a diseased microbiome in different contexts. And so they started enrolling a bunch of healthy people and a bunch of people with, for instance, inflammatory bowel disease and other diseases. And the idea was, let's document those microbiomes. What microbes are there, what genes are there? And then we can start to get a sense of, what are the commonalities of the healthy people, and how can that go wrong in these different disease states? There were some answers from that, but through those studies, we really started to get the image that there is this tremendous individuality in the gut microbiome. And so it's really hard to start drawing conclusions after initial pass of that project, of what is a healthy microbiome? But the other thing that we started to realize"}

In the principles of neuroscience, we talk about instructiveness versus permissiveness. There are instructive cues, like for instance, the ability to pick up this pen, right? There's an instruction, clearly there's a motor command, but that's just one way of looking at it. The way it actually works is that there's a pre-motor system that's already generating that movement, and what we've done is we've flung open the gate and allowed that movement to occur precisely. - Surfing it. - Right. - Surfing that current, or this current, or another current, or opening the window. - Exactly, and if you look at the formal study of movement and improvement of movement, the most basic example I can give is like a tennis serve. And they, if you just, and they've done this many times over. You map the trajectories, and in a novice the lines are all over the place, it ends up looking more like a tangle of rubber band ball, right? Whereas in the Federer or the expert, you almost wonder if it's just one line being drawn, but it's the trajectories are incredibly stereotyped. That's the reflection of one little narrow gate opening again, and again, and again. Of course- - Let me inject something here from an old neurologist, you can say, Bernstein, the Soviet. And he talked about degrees of freedom, and they did in order to increase productivity in Soviet Union. I don't know if you you've heard this story. - No. - He was brought in to examine the movement habits of the workers and he collected some information. He placed, he was one of the first kinetic, I don't know how it's called in English, the kinetic capturing of motion with moving pictures in that time. And so, he placed these dots and they took these photos, which became kind of moving. And what he discovered was something very interesting, the accuracy of the heat of the sledgehammer increased while the variants in the various points became more, not less. So, it wasn't a fixed pattern, it was a meta pattern. And this pattern is adjusted in this way to achieve the perfect execution. Those were very early findings, and I'm not sure how does that sit with everything, but I'm sure there is some truth to it from my experience. Basically, the self-adjusting dynamic nature of the system allows you to reach a very constant and stable end result by being so open and letting go of your control. - Mm-hmm, the example you give fits very well with the one that I described before because and I'm recalling the experiment. If people want to look this up, it's a paper, we'll put it in the show note caption, a guy also happens to be at Harvard named Bence Ölveczky, a Hungarian, I'm clearly pronouncing his name wrong, but I know Bence. And I remember the slide in my mind's eye, and the trajectory that was mapped was the movement of the tennis racket, not of the limbs themselves in the Federer case. So, that I think aligns well with what you're describing. Yeah, that exploration of degrees of freedom is where the opportunity for real advancement"}

protect children from bad behavior and help get parents some help so like substance abuse is is a bigger issue in Family Court than personality disorders but almost neck and neck we talk about substance abuse all the time openly there's treatment everyone recognizes the signs we don't talk about personality disorders in our culture and that's like flying under the radar so AR I'm just going to pause you for a second there I think it's such a key Point um you know in a very interesting paper that you sent me which by the way I'll provide a link to in our show note captions great it essentially kicks off by saying that you know the um the movement toward explaining to people what alcoh I think they now call it alcohol use disorder alcoholism right was is in the 1970s and 80s was a crucial move forward for the judicial system yes and I think nowadays people generally understand that addiction is not just a lack of willpower right that there are brain circuits that become hijacked by substances or behaviors that these brain circuits were designed to promote our adaptive Evolution but they can be hijacked by behaviors and substances that render people really um just unable to control their their addictive behavior I think nowadays that that box is checked and it's wonderful that the judicial system understands that right because then it can work with that um I don't think that the general public has yet come to the full appreciation of these personality disorders and these high conflict personalities and how pervasive they are um probably because of their prevalence it's just sort of all around us and in all sorts of interactions and here's the question high conflict interactions tend to be quote unquote dramatic yeah and there tends to be a almost a reward for dramatic Behavior as you said online in politics in the media the more dramatic the more salience the more salience the more people click the more people watch and then the algorithms are designed to look at you know like dwell time which is nerd speak for how long people look at stuff and so you could see how this stuff could be fed in the same way that for nearly you know 75 years leading up to the 1970s alcohol use disorder was sort of fed by the culture you have your 5:00 p.m. happy hour yeah coming up in science I would go to Scientific meetings and it was like okay five o'clock hits let's all drink and I always thought this is kind of crazy especially given that there was also a lot of concern about the kinds of interactions that drinking can create in the work environment it needs to high conflict Behavior exactly so anyway I don't want to riff too long on this but first of all this is just Laing the important work that you're doing second how should we think about this high conflict personality phenotype should we be calling PE people out like you know hey that's a narcissist hey that's a uh you know that's a borderline histrionic person or is there a more um I guess something that Embraces a little bit more of the humanity and the and the real issue at hand I think that's what you're trying to do yeah absolutely and you may have seen me shaking my head no and said should we point this out to people that's the last thing you want to do in fact don't do that and the reason why is is personality disorders oh oh let me just quickly distinguish between personality disorders high conflict personalities the difference is and there's a chart in the beginning of the book with two circles overlapping a lot of overlap but the main thing about personality disorders is they're stuck in a narrow range of interpersonal Behavior so some aren't high conflict people some are thing about high conflict people is that they're preoccupied with blame that blaming others is a big part of their life so when you're dealing with a high conflict person who's blaming and has a personality disorder you get a stuck pattern of behavior you get high conflict personalities or high conflict people so they're persistent in acting that way that's the overlap with personality disorders is they don't reflect they don't change they just keep blame as everybody out there so recognizing that difference and similarity so about half of people I think with personality disorders and this is just my estimate have high conflict personalities and about half don't I've worked with Border Lines in the psych Hospital narcissist that don't blame other people narcissists that are just self-centered but and borderlines who are more frustrated with themselves than anybody else so that that's an important distinction you beautifully distinguish between high conflict personalities and these personality disorders and I just want to make sure um everyone hears again that about half of people with personality disorders would fall into this high conflict personality in my estimation I don't have research yet um and the the distinguishing feature seems to be that high conflict personalities are often or constantly casting blame on others for the difficulties of their life essentially and that's why they have conflicts that's why and they escalate instead of getting worked on and resolved so I can imagine that the high conflict person doesn't always"}
{"question": "What are the short and long-term effects of taking kratom, particularly for individuals who are trying to wean themselves off other opioids?", "doc_id": "HoH93judXmE_1", "video_id": "HoH93judXmE", "video_title": "AMA #9: Kratom Risks, Does Infrared Sauna Work & Journaling Benefits", "video_header": "What Are the Short and Long-Term Effects of Taking Kratom?", "segment_idx": "1", "time_start": "1:42", "time_end": "24:11", "context": "So without further ado, let's get to answering your questions. The first question is about kratom. And the question is, what are the short and long-term effects of taking kratom? For those of you that haven't heard of kratom, kratom is a substance that comes from a tree that grows naturally in Indonesia. The tree itself is called mitragyna speciosa. And it's been known for hundreds of years or more. We don't really know how long, but at least for a couple of hundred years, that when people chew the leaves of this tree, they experience a mild stimulant effect. And there's also a process of extraction whereby you can take the leaves and get high concentrations of kratom that nowadays is packaged into various supplements. Most often consumed in capsule form, although sometimes it's sold in raw powder form. Here's the key thing to understand about kratom. Indeed at low dosages, kratom has a mild stimulant effect. However, at higher dosages, it has what's called an analgesic effect, that is a painkilling effect, and it acts as a sedative. And kratom itself acts as an opioid in the body. This is what's making kratom a very controversial topic these days. In particular, because most people have heard of the so-called opioid crisis. The opioid crisis has been a term coined to largely center around issues that have taken place in the United States, although these issues definitely extend beyond the borders of the United States. But the opioid crisis is essentially the overconsumption and widespread addiction to opioids. Opioids include things like morphine, oxycodone, also called OxyContin, and there are other opioids similar to those compounds, all of which have the general effect of being painkillers and sedatives. And in some people, again some people, eliciting a sense of euphoria in particular at low to moderate dosages. However, people quickly develop a tolerance to those drugs and need to consume more and more of them in order to get the effect that they initially got from a lower dosage. And they are not just highly habit-forming. They are highly addictive. And we can distinguish between habit forming and addictive by simply saying that addictive means people will continue to take something or do something despite negative consequences. There are other relevant definitions of addiction as well. I define addiction more broadly as the progressive narrowing of the things that give you pleasure. And indeed, when people get addicted to opioids, it is a very bad picture. It often hampers many, many areas of their lives, and seriously so. So the opioid crisis refers to the overprescription of opioid drugs. That's sort of what it generally taken to mean. But it also includes accessing opioids such as morphine, oxycodone, et cetera through gray market sources through, black market sources, and on and on. And of course, the acquisition of the drugs is just one piece it's also the over consumption of those drugs and, of course, the addiction to those drugs, which has proved to be so pernicious. So what does this have to do with kratom? Kratom is also an opioid. And we'll talk about how it differs in its opioid properties from the drugs I just talked about because it is different from morphine and hydrocodone, but it also has some similar properties as well. But the deal with kratom is that a good number of people out there have managed to wean themselves off opioids such as morphine and hydrocodone through the use of kratom. And that has been used as justification for keeping kratom on the market and keeping it legal. However, and this is a very important however, kratom itself has also proved to be not only habit forming but addictive, especially when taken at dosages that exceed that lower dose that just generally creates a bit of stimulant, a little bit of euphoric effect. When people start taking higher dosages of kratom, it is very clear that it does become addictive, and itself is very hard to come off of, so much so that people experience so-called kratom withdrawal. Now the reason I mentioned that kratom has been used by a good number of people to wean themselves off of the more potent forms of prescription opioids is that when I solicited for questions about kratom on social media, it was a very binary response. In fact, there was one camp a very rabid camp that said kratom is terrible. I took this stuff. I got addicted. It was extremely hard to come off of. There were additional comments in there, such as I know somebody who literally had to go to rehab because of kratom who developed a bunch of other addictions because of kratom. Essentially many, many responses of people who had only bad experiences with kratom. Meaning they liked it enough at first that they continued to take it, and it became addictive for them or somebody that they know. However, there was another camp that was equally vocal, which kept saying no if one really adheres to the lower dosages of kratom, kratom itself can be a useful tool for getting off other opioids. And there were even a few bona fide medical professionals, medical doctors that is, and I happen to know them and their reputations as quite good, who chimed in and sort of reconciled the two camps by saying indeed, if one can avoid taking kratom at all, you should. There is no reason to take this thing thinking that it's quote-unquote good for you. You would be wise to avoid taking it because there is a high probability if you take it at a given dosage or at a dosage that is going to get your brain and body into a state of euphoria, analgesia, and the sort of classic opioid effect that it's going to become habit forming or addicting for you. That said, these same medical professionals acknowledged that a fair number of people that they knew managed to get off of the more potent forms of opioids such as morphine, oxycodone, and so forth using kratom. And they said, well if it's a choice between being addicted to morphine and hydrocodone versus taking kratom and addicted to those substances and kratom somehow allowed them to taper off of those substances, that they would look more favorably upon kratom if and only if they would also commit to progressively lowering their dose of kratom and eventually coming off of kratom. So the general takeaway from all of that is if you can avoid taking kratom, meaning if you haven't taken it already, don't. And that reminds me of a very important point, which a guest on the Huberman lab podcast Dr. Robert Malenka who's an M.D. and Ph.D. He's my colleague at Stanford School of Medicine. He's a world expert on the mechanisms underlying addiction and dopamine and drug reinforcement, among many other things. What he said on the podcast is absolutely true, which is that it is impossible to get addicted to a substance that you've never consumed. That might seem obvious but think about that one again. It is impossible to get addicted to a substance that you've never consumed. So I think the safest statement to make is if you have not tried kratom, you would be wise to avoid it because you stand a chance to become addicted to it. If, however, you are somebody that's addicted to other forms of opioids, you absolutely should talk to your physician about that and how to get off of those opioids. But there is evidence that some people have used kratom to successfully wean themselves off the more potent forms of opioids that I talked about, namely morphine and hydrocodone, as well as a few others. Now if you're somebody who already takes kratom, you need to be very thoughtful about the dosage that you take. And you also need to be thoughtful about the fact that people differ dramatically in their response to opioids. This is oh so important, and people do not talk about this enough. We hear, for instance, that, oh, if people are taking anywhere from one to five grams, maybe one to six grams of kratom per day, that's keeping it in the dosage range for which people don't generally tend to get addicted, you'll hear things like that. And by the way, when I say one to five or one to six grams per day, I'm not talking about the individual compounds that are present in kratom. There are a couple of different plant alkaloids I'll talk about in a moment that are present in kratom. And these have different effects on the opioid system. So nowadays, some of the companies that sell kratom. And by the way, this is sold over the counter as a supplement. It does not require a prescription to purchase, at least at this point in time, in the United States. Some of these products will have a higher concentration of one or the other alkaloids within them such that you can't really compare one gram of one brand of kratom to one gram of another brand of kratom because they can have wildly different levels of these different alkaloids. And these different alkaloids have wildly different impact on different aspects of your brain and body biology. In particular, how much they tend to impact the so-called endogenous opioid system, OK. So when we talk about dosages, we have to keep this in the back of our mind. And we have to keep in the back of our mind that there does seem to be a subgroup of people. We don't know how big this subgroup of people is, but we know it's not everyone, but it's somewhere between 10 and 40% of people seem to respond to opioids in a particularly potent way. They really like them. And perhaps not surprisingly, people outside of that category don't tend to like opioids. I can certainly say that I am somebody who, when I've been prescribed things like Vicodin or any other opioid post-surgery for pain, I hate taking those drugs. I absolutely hate it. I'd rather deal with the pain. They make me nauseous. They make me feel terrible. That said, I know people who love opioids. It's like a natural fit for their chemistry in the sense that it tends to evoke more euphoria. They just immediately like the feeling. Some of you may remember the episode of the Huberman Lab podcast that I did about alcohol. And there, too, I discussed the fact that about 8% to 10% of people who consume alcohol get an increased dopamine response to alcohol that's not observed in other people. And that particular subgroup of people is very, very at risk for developing alcohol use disorder, sometimes called alcoholism, because they can drink in a way and they experience a high from drinking in a way that other people simply do not experience. Now like everybody else, if they consume too much alcohol, they get drunk. So it's not about the drunk effect, it's about the dopamine and other sorts of chemicals that are released in those people in response to alcohol that other people just don't seem to experience at the same level of potency. So again, with things like kratom and the other opioids, there's a category of people, and it's a much larger category of people, again 10% to 40%. We don't know exactly how many because the studies are not really completed, and there aren't enough of those studies yet, unfortunately. But when those people take an opioid, wow, oh, wow, do they like it. And those people, in particular, are very much at risk for developing an addiction to opioids. And so those people, especially, should never ever go near kratom if they haven't. Or if they are already taking kratom, these are the people that are constantly ratcheting up their dose. These are the people that tell you no, I'm not addicted, but if you were to say, hey, all right, well then let's do an experiment where you don't take kratom for a week, those are going to be the people that are suddenly going to get anxious about the mere idea of that. I've also talked about this in reference to cannabis when I did an episode about cannabis. Again I'm not putting a blanket statement out there about cannabis as being good or bad. On that episode, I talked about the fact that cannabis does indeed have various therapeutic uses. But that there are a good number of people who rely on cannabis for anxiety control and other ways of modulating their brain chemistry and bodily chemistry such that if you were to say, hey, are you addicted to cannabis? They'd say no, I don't have to smoke cannabis. I don't have to take my edibles. But if you were to push them a little bit and say, all right, well then, let's do an experiment where you don't consume any cannabis in any form for 10 days. They don't like the idea of that experiment at all. So much so that were they to run that experiment, they would experience a lot of the withdrawal symptoms associated with addiction. So I can't, in good faith, say that kratom is safe for everybody because it is simply not. Now is it safer than the other opioids? And if so, why? Well, in order to address that, let's take a short glance at the pharmacology of kratom and how it works in terms of its neurochemistry in the body. Now I'm going to keep this pretty brief because, in the future, I'm going to do an extended episode all about opioids, and I will include kratom in that conversation. But just to back up a little bit and discuss what opioids are. Opioids are compounds that can activate the so-called endogenous opioid system. All of us have within our brain and body the capacity to release our own opioids. That's right. You have opioids within your body. They are released from neurons, and they bind to so-called opioid receptors. Perhaps some of you have heard of the so-called runner's high. The runner's high is a euphoric state. It's a fairly mild euphoric state in most cases. But it's a euphoric state induced by long-duration effort, a.k.a. the runner's high. The runner's high is just a phrase used to explain that when we engage in long-duration repetitive action effort, the body starts releasing these endogenous opioids they bind to receptors, and they trigger things like analgesia, relief from pain. They trigger mild euphoria. They tend to change our perception of the outside world, make things look more beautiful, shiny. They give things a little bit of a sheen. What I just described is a mild version of what people experience when they take something like morphine. When people take morphine, there's a more of a sedative effect, there's more of a euphoric effect, and there's more of a dreamlike effect. And again, it will depend on dosage. Kratom and morphine, and hydrocodone all have the property of acting like the endogenous opioids but at much higher potency. When you bring them into your system, they cross the blood-brain barrier. So they go into the brain, and they bind to a number of different opioid receptors. There's the mu-opioid receptor. By the way, these names all follow Greek alphabet letters. So the mu-opioid receptor, the kappa opioid receptor, there are a bunch of different ones. Kratom binds preferentially to the mu-opioid receptor and somewhat to the kappa opioid receptor. There's a big misconception out there. A lot of people, especially people who are proponents of kratom, will say no morphine and hydrocodone bind the mu-opioid receptor, whereas kratom binds the kappa opioid receptor. So it's a different compound. Very, very different. Not true. Not true. Kratom, morphine, and hydrocodone all bind to the mu-opioid receptor. And that's what's largely responsible for its opioid-like effects. Especially when you get the dosage up to a level where you start getting the mild sedation, the analgesia, the pain relief. And keep in mind a lot of people are taking kratom because they want pain relief. And when that mu-opioid receptor system is activated, it indirectly activates a lot of the reinforcement circuitry in the brain that relates to dopamine and serotonin. This is another area that we'll go into in more depth in the future. But there's been a lot of controversy. People saying, oh, you know kratom doesn't trigger the dopamine system, therefore, it's not addictive. But that is simply not true. It indirectly activates the reinforcement circuitry that includes both dopamine and serotonin. But its primary effect is to hit this mu-opioid receptor system that exists in a bunch of places in the brain but mainly in the brainstem in a structure called the periaqueductal gray nucleus, which then provides pain relief. It triggers a number of different shifts in cognition. It's what creates that mild euphoria, et cetera, et cetera. Now how can we be so confident that kratom is acting so similarly to hydrocodone and to morphine, albeit with lower potency? And the reason is if you give people a drug that blocks the mu-opioid receptor prior to them taking kratom, they don't experience any of the classic effects of taking kratom. No euphoria, no analgesia, no sedation. Even at the low dosages no mild stimulant effect. So we really have to look at kratom as an opioid, OK. That's just the honest truth. And if you're somebody who doesn't like this message because you like kratom, I'm not telling you that you don't like kratom, I'm telling you likely like kratom because it's an opioid. So again, if you go online and you start asking questions about kratom, again, you're going to see these two camps. You're going to see the kratom is terrible, it's addictive, it's everything bad camp. And then you're going to see the other camp out there very vocal as well, talking about how kratom helped them avoid other things that are worse. And this is an argument that, frankly, I don't think we want to lean on, right. The idea that substance A is not as bad as substance B. And that making substance A unavailable is just going to send everyone running for substance B. That's a weak argument, frankly. I heard this argument around cannabis. And by the way, I think pretty balanced about cannabis. If you listen to the episode I did on cannabis, I think you'll agree that I believe that cannabis has its therapeutic applications. I also believe that young people, especially young males with a predisposition to psychosis, should not be taking high-concentration THC cannabis. Because the data tell us they are already at risk of psychosis, and they are at a much greater risk of psychosis if they do. So I think I'm pretty balanced about the story on cannabis. But I often hear the argument oh cannabis isn't as bad as alcohol and, therefore, cannabis is good. That's simply not rational. What we should be saying is whether or not it's cannabis or alcohol or kratom or any substance for that matter, what are the potential benefits, what are the potential risks? And again, this is far too much than we can go into in this AMA. And we will go into in a future full-length episode of the Huberman Lab podcast. But the other thing to really keep in mind is the lack of regulation over kratom supplements. Now as many of you know, I am a fan of many, not all, but many supplements in certain conditions. I always say behavior is first, then nutrition. Then if and only if it's needed, rely on supplementation. But supplementation is a big category. But when we're talking about supplements that are opioid compounds, I start to get nervous because of the high abuse potential and the high addiction potential of opioids. And kratom is included in that category. A couple of other key notes about kratom. While death directly from kratom is fairly rare, it has happened. Now hydrocodone and morphine suppress respiration. Actually, suppress breathing by way of a mechanism that, if you're a listener of the Huberman Lab podcast, you know about. Which is the so-called physiological sigh. Many of you have heard me talk about the physiological sigh. Is something that you do voluntarily the double Inhale through the nose and then a long exhale in order to rapidly reduce your level of stress. As far as we know, that's the fastest way to deliberately lower your level of stress. But the physiological sigh was discovered in the 1930s as a spontaneous pattern of breathing that occurs involuntarily in sleep in order to reinflate the lungs and offload carbon dioxide and bring oxygen back into the system on the subsequent breath. When I interviewed Dr. Jack Feldman, who is a professor at University of California Los Angeles and really the pioneer of the modern neuroscience understanding of respiration, he talked about some studies in his laboratory that were exploring why people die when taking opioids. This is a major issue associated with the opioid crisis. And what he mentioned was that the opioids bind to particular receptors in the brain stem locations that generate physiological sighs. So opioids, when taken as drugs, suppress physiological sighing and do so during sleep. And lack of adequate respiration, meaning people stop breathing during sleep, is one of the primary reasons why people die when they take opioids. Now kratom is not known to suppress respiration when taken at low to moderate dosages. But when combined with any other opioids, and certainly when combined with alcohol, it can suppress respiration. And while the data on this are fairly scant, there is some evidence that kratom-induced death is caused by suppression of the respiration system. So again, death due to taking kratom at the dosages that are recommended on most commercial packaging is fairly rare, although it has happened. It's unclear if it happened because it was taken in combination with other compounds. That seems likely. But we can't forget that a lot of people are taking kratom at much higher dosages and, in fact, progressively higher and higher dosages from these over-the-counter sources. And with increased dosage, there is, yes, an increased risk of respiratory failure. So again, all of this points to the fact that kratom is simply not a benign substance. So if we're going to be very honest, the addictive potential of kratom is real. It is exacerbated for some people compared to others, but it is real. It's very similarities to other more potent forms of opioids are what make it attractive for some people who are trying to come off those more potent form of opioids. But the goal, of course, is to completely come off all opioids. And kratom itself can be a bit of a trap. It can be a trap in the sense that people who have never taken other opioids can become addicted to kratom itself. That is absolutely clear that can happen. It has happened in a great number of people. It's also clear that kratom can potentially be a trap. Notice I said potentially. Because if people are trying to come off other more potent forms of opioids and then they use kratom to do that, and then they're ratcheting up their dosage of kratom such that they're now matching the endogenous response to kratom in a way that doesn't really distinguish from the effects that they were getting from morphine and hydrocodone, well then they're just using a different form of morphine and hydrocodone. And I'm sure that some of you are out there saying that is ridiculous. You cannot compare the effects of kratom to the effects of hydrocodone. But the potency is about one-sixth of hydrocodone. And there are people out there who are just increasing and increasing both the dosage and modifying the type of kratom that they're taking so that they're getting the kratom that has a particularly high concentration of one of the alkaloids that hits that mu-opioid receptor hardest. And in doing so, sure, they're not getting the pure hydrocodone effect, but they're getting really close. So my advice would be, if you haven't touched kratom, don't touch it at all, ever. If you are taking kratom, you need to take note of what we just discussed."}

Glucose", "segment_idx": "3", "time_start": "12:38", "time_end": "19:42", "context": "I'm happy to go first this one's this one's this is a pretty straightforward paper so so we're going to talk about a paper titled reassessing the evidence of a survival advantage in type 2 diabetics treated with metformin compared with controls without diabetes a retrospective cohort study this is by Matthew Thomas Keyes and colleagues this was published last fall um why is this paper important so this paper is important because in 2014 uh banister published a paper that I think in many ways kind of got the world very excited about metformin so it was almost 10 years ago and I'm sure many people have heard about this paper even if they're not familiar with it but they've heard the concept of the paper and in many ways it's the paper that has led to the excitement around the potential for zero protection with metformin and I should probably just Define for the audience what Giro protection means when we think probably also sorry to interrupt what metformin is just for the uninformed that's a great point so I'll start with the with the latter so metformin is a drug that has been used for many years uh depends you know where it was first approved I think was in Europe um but you know call it directionally 50 plus years of use as a first line agent for patients with type 2 diabetes in the U.S maybe 40 plus years so this is a drug that's been around forever trade name glucophage or brand name and uh but but again it's you know it's a generic drug today the mechanism by which metformin works is debated hotly but what I think is not debated is the immediate thing that metformin does which is it inhibits complex one of the mitochondria so again maybe just taking a step back so the mitochondria as everybody thinks of those as the cellular engine for making ATP so the most efficient way that we make ATP is through oxidative phosphorylation where we take either fatty acid pieces or a breakdown product of glucose once it's partially metabolized to pyruvate we put that into an electron transport chain and we basically trade chemical energy for electrons that can then be used to make phosphates onto ADP so it's you know you think of everything you do eating is taking the chemical energy and food taking the energy that's in those bonds making electrical energy in the mitochondria those electrons pump a gradient that allow you to make ATP to give a sense of how Primal and important this is if you block that process completely you die so everybody's probably heard of cyanide right cyanide is something that is incredibly toxic even at the smallest doses cyanide is a complete Blocker of this process and if my memory serves me correctly I think it blocks complex four of the mitochondria I don't know if you recall if it complex three are complex four I know a lot about toxins that impact the nervous system but I don't know a lot about poison but if ever you want to have some fun we can talk about all the dangerous stuff that animals make and insects make and how they kill you yeah prototoxin and all these things that blocks I I really geek out on this stuff because it allows me to talk about Neuroscience animals and scary stuff it's like combines it so we could do that sometime for fun maybe at the end if we have a few moments so so you know something like cyanide that is a very potent inhibitor of this electron transport chain will kill you instantly people understand that of course a drop of Cyanide and you would you would be dead literally instantaneously yeah so metformin works at the first of those complexes I believe there are four if my memory serves correctly four electron transport chain complexes and um but of course it's not a complete inhibition of it it's just kind of a weak Blocker of that and the net effect of that is what so the net effect of that is that it changes the ratio of adenosine monophosphate to adenosine diphosphate um what's less clear is why does that have a benefit in diabetics because what it unambiguously does is reduces the amount of glucose that the liver puts out so hepatic glucose output is one of the fundamental problems that's happening in type 2 diabetes you may recall I think we talked about this even on a previous podcast you and I sitting here with normal blood sugar have about five grams of glucose in our total circulation that's it five grams think about how quickly the brain will go through that within minutes so the only thing that keeps Us Alive is our liver's ability to titrate out glucose and if it puts out too much for example if the glucose can if the glucose level was consistently two teaspoons you would have type 2 diabetes so the difference between being metabolically healthy and having you know profound type 2 diabetes is one teaspoon of glucose in your bloodstream so the ability of the liver to Tamp down on high glucose output is important metformin seems to do that so can I just ask oh one question is it fair um to provide this overly simplified summary of the biochemistry which is that when we eat the food is broken down but the breaking of bonds creates energy that then our cells can use in the form of ATP and the mitochondria are essential of that process and that metformin is partially short-circuiting the energy production process and so even though we are eating when we have metformin in our system presumably there is going to be less net glucose the bonds are going to be broken down we're chewing we're digesting but less of that is turned into blood sugar glucose well sort of I mean it's not um it's not depriving you of ultimately storing that energy what it's doing is changing the way the body um partitions fuel that's probably a better way to think about it to be a little bit more accurate so um for example like it's not depriving you of the calories that are in that glucose that would be you know fantastic but that was the that was the uh Electra remember the Electra from the 90s Electra folks for those of you don't remember um by the way if you ever ate this stuff you'd remember because it was a fat that was not easily digested it had sort of in sort of analogous to plant fiber or something like that so it was being put into potato chips and whatnot and the idea is that people would um would simply excrete it um and I don't know what happened except that people got a lot of stomach aches and um in the world we know that the anal seepage is what really did that product only a physician because after all Peter's a clinician for physician and MD and I'm not um could find it a um an appropriate term to describe yeah when you have that much when you have that much fat malabsorption you start to have accidents wow and so that did away with that product right it was either that or the diaper industry was trying to really take off okay that's why you don't hear about Electro that's right so so we've got"}

What's becoming clear from the neuro-biological imaging studies is that as people start to advance into adolescence and adulthood and well into their elderly years, the same circuits that were active and established in childhood are repurposed for other forms of attachment. And that to have truly complete bonds with other individuals, but in particular with romantic partners, it's important that there be both synchronization of physiology and synchronization of these more, I guess we could call them more rational or predictive type circuits. So we can leverage this information, we can start to think about what sorts of bonds to us feel very enriching and very complete. We know that we can have, for instance, an emotional connection with somebody, but we can also have a cognitive connection with somebody. I have many colleagues with whom I have deep intellectual connection and convergence with. I won't say that I have deep emotional connection with most of them, a few of them, yes, but most of them no. Others in my life, for instance, I have a deep emotional connection to, but not a lot of deep cognitive connection to. A good example would be the connection that I had with my bulldog, who unfortunately passed away. But Costello, we had a very close, emotional connection, right? It was based on touch, it was based on our walks, it was based on fun, it was very autonomic. We rarely discussed if ever what we were doing, we had a felt relationship as opposed to a cognitive relationship. And while I'm sort of half kidding about that, as an example, it's a really good example, it was a very real bond. And in fact, just as a brief anecdote, I can remember when Costello was a puppy and I was entirely responsible for his well-being, like any parent of any infant, I lost my appetite for those few weeks when I was house training him and I seem to lose all ability to process any cognitive information. Now I was also sleep deprived, but I was entirely focused on the autonomic bond that we were forming. And now, thankfully, that eventually was established pretty quickly. Basically I went on to just basically feed him, walk him and do everything for him, and we had a wonderful relationship. Now it's very clear that what we're talking about here"}

{"question": "What are some strategies for intentionally shifting my attention during meditation to either focus inwardly on my internal state or outwardly on external stimuli, and how can I use this awareness to adapt my meditation practice to the specific context and situation I'm in?", "doc_id": "wTBSGgbIvsY_8", "video_id": "wTBSGgbIvsY", "video_title": "How Meditation Works & Science-Based Effective Meditations | Huberman Lab Podcast #96", "video_header": "Tools: Interoceptive or Exteroceptive Bias, Meditation Challenge", "segment_idx": "8", "time_start": "53:30", "time_end": "1:01:46", "context": "So that brings us to a tool, and it's a tool that any and all of us can use whether or not you tend to be interoceptively dominant, right, that you tend to pay more attention to your bodily sensations, or exteroceptively dominant. And, again, if you don't know the answer to that question, there's a simple test that you can do. You can just sit down or lie down, close your eyes, and you can ask yourself or assess whether or not your attention tends to fleet to things outside of you, right, cars honking or going by, people in the room, or whether or not you tend to be able to focus on your internal landscape to the exclusion of exteroception and attention to things outside the confines of your skin easily. Now, of course, this will depend on context and situation, even how well rested you are, et cetera, but that's exactly the point. This is the sort of thing you want to do every time you decide to do a meditation practice. In fact, I would suggest that you use this to determine what meditation you do at any given moment. So let's say you are somebody who is a regular meditator or let's say you're somebody who's never meditated and you'd like to develop a meditation practice. I suggest that you do a test of whether or not you are more interoceptively dominant or exteroceptively dominant in that moment. Again, this is not a personality trait. This is a question about where you happen to be in a moment. So let's say you're on a plane or you're in the car. If you're in the car, please don't close your eyes while driving, that's sort of obvious, but do this in a safe way, please. But stop, close your eyes, and assess whether or not you can access and focus your attention primarily on your internal state or whether or not your attention and perception gets pulled to something external, to exteroception. And, again, that will vary depending on circumstance and who you are. Then I suggest opening your eyes and trying to focus your attention to something external to you and seeing or evaluating the extent to which you can divorce your perception from sensations that occur at the level of your skin or internally. Now, I should say that there's no technology, at least not that I'm aware of, absence of fMRI machine, in which case, you are inside an fMRI machine while you do this. But unless you are in that experiment, and most of us aren't, there's no technology that can tell you, for instance, whether or not you are interoceptively dominant or exteroceptively dominant and whether or not the ratio is, you know, 75 to 25 or what have you at any given moment. You have to assess this subjectively. However, if you sit down, for instance, and you notice that you can equally split your attention between internal sensations and external sensations or whether or not you find yourself pulled into external sensations when you're trying to focus inward or you find yourself pulled inward when you're trying to focus outward, well, that will dictate the sort of meditation that you perhaps ought to perform in that moment. Let me give an example of how you would do this. You would stop in some way, so sit or lie down, close your eyes, and evaluate whether or not you can essentially rule out or eliminate attention to all outside events. Most people won't be able to do that entirely, but try and focus your attention, for instance, on your breathing or the typical third eye center, you know, focusing at a spot right behind your forehead. If you feel you can do that reasonably well to the exclusion of what's happening around you, well, then an important question arises. Should you meditate in a way to enhance that interoceptive awareness? Or rather, should you meditate in a way, for instance, with your eyes open and your attention on a particular portion of the landscape you're in like a tree or maybe even, you know, an object or a plant or something else in your immediate environment to try and cultivate or enhance your exteroceptive awareness? That's up to you, but my bias would be one in which you work against your default state. Again, the default mode network is where you land on this interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum. It's going to lead to more mind wandering, whereas when you encourage or we could even say force yourself a little bit to anchor your attention to either inside your body or outside your body, and you make that decision according to what you are doing less easily, well, then you are actively training up the neural circuits. You are engaging so-called neuroplasticity, the brain's ability to change in response to experience. You are deliberately engaging a shift along that continuum. To make this crystal clear, what I mean is this. Let me give an example. If I were to sit down and I wanted to do some meditation, let's just say three minutes of meditation. There's good evidence that even three minutes of meditation can be beneficial for a variety of things, including enhanced focus and enhanced anxiety management. Let's say I sit down and I notice that I can really focus inward on what's happening at the level of my skin and my internal organs, and I can rule out everything. Maybe that's 'cause the room is quiet or maybe it's just because my brain is in a state that I'm particularly good at that at that moment or maybe it's just a natural ability. Well then I would opt for a three-minute meditation practice in which I deliberately exterocept, that I build up the circuitry to focus on something external to me because I want, and I think most people would like, to have an adaptive mechanism within them so that they can slide along that continuum and they don't default to whatever happens to be easiest for them in that moment. Now, if I were to sit down and try and focus on what's going on internally and I kept getting distracted by things happening outside of me, opening my eyes or feeling like I need to reach for my phone or paying attention to the sounds in the room, well, then I would actively engage a meditation practice, in this case, a three-minute example but it could be longer, where I'm deliberately trying to focus my perception on events at the level of the confines of my skin and internally. Why do I say this? Well, you know, I love to use the phrase anytime with kids, you know, when they say \"This is really hard or something's challenging,\" or adults will say, \"That's really tough.\" Well, as my graduate advisor used to say, that means you're learning. If something were easy, if you can perform any activity or thought, et cetera, well, then there is absolutely zero reason for your neural circuits to change. It's the friction, it's the feeling that something is hard that turns on the enormous variety of mechanisms at the level of cells, et cetera, that allow you to potentially change your neural circuitry. So challenge and discomfort is the signal to your brain and body that something needs to change, so I'm encouraging you to embark on meditative practices that are not your default, okay? To essentially go against the grain of where your interoceptive bias or your exteroceptive bias happens to be at a given moment. And, again, this will change. For some of you, this will change across the day where early in the day, you are very, very good at doing an interoceptive-biased meditation, and later in the day, you aren't. I actually believe, based on the data that I've covered, and we'll get into a few more papers about this, and my lab is actively working on this as well, that a meditative practice can be made far more effective, that is, it can invoke more neuroplasticity, more shift in brain states and brain circuitry if we do not take the easy path, that is, we go against the grain of what our brain would naturally do in a given moment. So if you're in a crowded airport and you're finding that everything's very distracting, well, then that would be a great time to do some interoceptive focused meditation. Whereas if you are really in your head, you know, you're looping thoughts about the past and present, maybe you're even in obsessive thought, well, that would be a terrific time, an ideal time really, to do a short meditation focused on something external to you. In both cases, whether or not you're focused on interoceptive bias or exteroceptive bias, you are going against, or I should say you're pushing back against your default mode network. I would argue it's going to be far more effective, that is, you're going to reduce or shift the activity of that default mode network far more and in a far more beneficial way if you actively try and suppress your bias toward being more interoceptive or exteroceptive. Now, I think that's immensely beneficial, both for the immediate changes that you experience,"}

basis for Mo the majority of the Waking Life of these young people is maladaptive yeah that's right I mean it's it's so Stark that's right think about it this way um and imagine that your children are having a life out in the real world they're having Adventures they're doing things they're building forts in the forest they're doing all sorts of things and then one day you know a casino opens up nearby and it welcomes all the kids and that's where they spent all their time is in a casino and they're in the care of a company that is trying to extract as much money as it can from them and that's what they do eight or 10 hours a day it's an Abomination to think that a casino could own our children's childhood what if it wasn't a casino what if it was a brothel for the for the boys would be more of Interest let's say like again inconceivable that we would let that happen but what we've done is we've said well what if it's Snapchat what if it's Instagram what if it's Facebook well not so much Facebook what if it's Tik Tok these companies these are the some of the largest and most powerful companies in the world they essentially own our children's childhood this is where childhood is taking place on a few giant PL for-profit platforms who that use an Advertising based business model so they are motivated like the Cino to keep them in don't have a clock don't let them see what time it is keep them in don't let them click over to a link to another site keep them in um we somehow have seeded our children's childhood to Giant companies that have shown that they don't really care about our kids welfare they care much more about profitability and and they care about their customers who are the advertisers and these companies have been granted a special RIT from the King Congress said in in in the in section 230 of the communications decency act in 1996 I think it was Congress said oh and nobody sue you nobody can sue you for what you show to their kids uh there was a reason for that that you don't want AOL to be responsible for everything anyone posts but it's been so broadly interpreted that so far any attempt to regulate social media or any attempt to sue them is seen as like no no so you know it's just we somehow slipped into this and once you see it that way that it's as though our kids are being raised in hara's Casino you know like like no we've got to stop this last year I had the opportunity to speak to to some of the groups at these companies that are assigned to controlling the well-being of the young people that use their platforms and the major emphasis was on the type of content so protecting them against child Predators protecting them against pornography um but as you recall at the beginning of the conversation we broke things down into variables of time specific content Dynamics and maybe the visual interface itself I think for sake of today's discussion the visual interface is probably the least interesting but I can just tell you looking things up close uh a lot not good the eyeball lengthens you become nearsighted which is why spending two hours outside um even if on a tablet has been shown to offset myopia and oh wow thousands of people children anyway there's that piece but the time piece is interesting right maybe limiting the total amount of time on social media obviously the content issue is it only takes one exposure to a video of the sort that you described The Gauntlet I never want to see it whatever has to be done to my phone so that I never see it please uh let me know um but it just seems as if this has been allowed to it's like it's almost like an IV drip of glucose or something happening in the background we're saying okay just stay rigged up to um the glucose trip and then we wonder why we're end up with let's just say cognitively uh obese children yeah that's right the whenever there's New Media um The public's emphasis is always on the content and and so with television the emphasis was well violence on TV is this going to make them violent and it turns out not really watching violent on violence on TV doesn't really make you violent and video games these violent video games these firstperson shooter games are these going to make our kids into killers and there was a lot of research on that it looks like no it doesn't really it doesn't really do that and so many researchers then say see it's just a moral Panic it's okay but that is but that's focusing on the content and this was the great lesson from Marshall mclan and Neil Postman and all these great media theaters in the 20th Century um mcluen said the medium is the message don't Focus so much on the content of Television focus on the transformation of human life when the television becomes the family Hearth and people sit around watching it now from our vantage point today that's pretty darn social they're sitting with their family members together ex having an experience but mcl's point was that's the transformative thing the the what the technology does it's not the content and so in the same way a life on social media in some ways it's like television you're watching stuff but it's much more behaviorist with television you didn't have the constant I do something I'm rewarded I do something I'm rewarded so so social media is much much more addictive than television ever was that's one aspect of the uh television is not performative it doesn't make you live your life in front of a camera you're not in front of a camera you're a passive recipient whereas social media puts our kids in front of a camera um so in all these ways we we get distracted and and this is the the way you know in those Senate hearings uh it was all focused on content you know can't we can't we reduce the you know the number of beheading videos and the child pornography suppose we you know can't we reduce that by 90% wouldn't that be great you know Senator we have the you know World leading technology and doing this um yes that would be nice to for our kids to see less hardcore porn and and less violent videos that would be nice but if if we could make Instagram just be happy girls living beautiful

{"question": "How can using certain lubricants affect the health and motility of sperm during intercourse?", "doc_id": "O1YRwWmue4Y_19", "video_id": "O1YRwWmue4Y", "video_title": "How to Optimize Fertility in Males & Females", "video_header": "Tools: Tracking Ovulation, Libido, Lubricants", "segment_idx": "19", "time_start": "1:53:28", "time_end": "1:56:37", "context": "So they'll actually measure intravaginal temperature. They're looking for changes in temperature that are consistent around the time of ovulation. We're going to have an expert guest on, an OB/GYN, who can tell us a lot more about the details and nuances of the temperature method. You'll see a lot of information about this online, but there's a lot of misunderstanding about it, as well. Other women will use apps that take into account either the temperature information if they're acquiring temperature information-- that'll be entered into the app-- as well as marking the onset of menstruation, the onset of bleeding, therefore, the start of the ovulatory cycle, because, of course, as we mentioned earlier, that marks day one of their cycle. And then, again and again, you can see how regularity of cycle duration or relative regularity of cycle duration really favors this whole process of being able to predict when one ovulates. And fortunately, if the goal is fertilization, there are some margins for error that are introduced by the fact that the sperm can survive within the female reproductive tract for some period of days, thereby reducing the need for absolute certainty about the time of ovulation and so on. In fact, it's pretty well known that around the time of ovulation a couple of things happen. Earlier, we talked about one thing, which is there's an increase in libido just prior to ovulation. This relates to, in part, an increase in some of the androgens, things like DHEA, but also testosterone and some related androgens that can increase libido both in males and females and changes to the reproductive pathway, the female in particular, a change in the pH-- that is, the relative acidity versus basic nature of the mucosal lining near the cervix and also vaginal secretions, such that, around the time of ovulation, the entire milieu of the vagina and the cervix and the locations in which fertilization can occur and certainly in which the sperm are swimming towards the opportunity for fertilization is shifted to support sperm motility and health. In other words, one of the best environments for sperm to survive is going to be within the female reproductive pathway itself. And as long as we're talking about vaginal secretions and mucus, it's important to point out that a number of commercially available lubricants can actually be detrimental for sperm health, even if they don't contain spermicide. So this is something that you'll want to discuss with your OB/GYN or, certainly if you're male, you could also discuss this with your urologist and your partner's OB/GYN. A lot of the commercially available lubricants contain chemicals that, while they may favorably change the consistency or the viscosity of the vaginal pathway for purposes of intercourse, certainly may not be the most favorable for maintaining the health of the sperm and the motility of the sperm. So again, here we're talking about intercourse only in the context of trying to maximize fertilization. And I should mention that there are certain lubricants that are more conducive to the sperm environment. But it's something that you'll really want to talk to your OB/GYN about or at least read up about if your interest is in trying to fertilize and develop an embryo. So we covered the optimal strategies for how often couples should have intercourse"}

{"question": "What are the three main ways that lithium, a commonly used treatment for bipolar disorder, works to improve symptoms and prevent neurodegeneration?", "doc_id": "m_OazsImOiI_13", "video_id": "m_OazsImOiI", "video_title": "The Science & Treatment of Bipolar Disorder | Huberman Lab Podcast #82", "video_header": "Effects of Lithium: BDNF, Anti-inflammatory & Neuroprotection", "segment_idx": "13", "time_start": "1:05:07", "time_end": "1:10:08", "context": "have been quite rigorous in trying to understand why and how lithium works in order to understand the why and how of bipolar disorder. This is the way that proper medicine and science is done. Even if there's an excellent treatment for something, it's important to understand why that treatment works because, first of all, not everyone responds to that treatment. Second of all, scientists and physicians understand that just because we have one treatment that works, if it has any side effects at all, there is the possibility for better treatments. So it's not just about trying to bypass a drug that doesn't make much money for drug companies, I know a lot of people think in those terms, they think, oh, well, there's this continued search for better treatments for bipolar disorder even though lithium works because lithium doesn't allow drug companies to make much money. That's not really the case. The fact of the matter is is that the toxicity, some of the other issues that are created with lithium, the fact that people need the ongoing blood testing, et cetera, really stimulates the need, really an urgent need for new and better treatments for bipolar disorder. And only by understanding how lithium works at the cellular level, at the neural circuit level, et cetera, do we really stand to find those new discoveries. If you were to do a literature search on the actions and mechanisms of lithium in terms of how it can calm people down and reduce their manic episodes, you would find an enormous array of papers, literally thousands of scientific studies in animals and in humans, which, for instance will tell you that lithium treatment will increase so-called BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor. BDNF is often talked about in the context of neuroplasticity, the brain and nervous system's ability to change in response to experience. And indeed it does seem that ingesting lithium increases BDNF. BDNF is what we call permissive for neuroplasticity. It doesn't create specific changes in the brain, meaning it's not going to make your memory better or your coordination better, or your emotional state better per se, what BDNF does is it permits the neurons, the nerve cells and their connections in the brain to be more likely to change if the proper environmental conditions are met. That is BDNF creates a kind of buoyancy to neuroplasticity. It opens the gates to neuroplasticity. So lithium does increase BDNF, we'll talk about why that's important in the context of the neural circuits involved with bipolar disorder in a few minutes. It also seems to be a potent anti-inflammatory. Now, inflammation is one of those words that's thrown around extensively nowadays, especially on social media and especially as it relates to any health condition, it's like inflammation, inflammation, inflammation, always seems to be discussed in the context of inflammation being bad. But I do want to point out that inflammation is a natural adaptive response to physical injury to a cell or organ or tissue of any kind. Inflammation is the basis by which adaptations occur to exercise. So if, for instance, you were to weight train and use a heavier than normal weight kind, do a set to failure or create some little micro tears in the muscle that are healthy in the sense that they would create adaptations and make that muscle stronger, maybe even grow that muscle, there's an inflammatory response associated with that that is critical to the positive adaptation. So inflammation isn't always bad, although excessive, or as we say, runaway inflammation is bad. Lithium seems to be able to suppress inflammation and, importantly, it can suppress inflammation in neural tissues and within the brain in particular. That is important. And we return to that and why it's important in a little bit. The other thing about lithium is that lithium is neuroprotective, that is it can prevent neurons from dying under certain conditions. Why would neurons die? Well, there are a lot of reasons why neurons can die. There can be a physical insult to the neurons. You can get hit really hard in the head, a bullet, God forbid, can enter the skull and kill neurons, there are a lot of reasons why neurons can die. Neuroprotection is a situation in which a neuron is given some sort of chemical or physical resiliency that allows it to suffer an insult and yet bounce back. So it's very similar to the way that we think about psychological resiliency, neuroprotection is an ability for neurons to be better able to handle stress of different kinds, in particular, excitotoxicity. There's a phenomenon in bipolar disorder and a lot of other psychiatric conditions in which hyperactivity of certain brain areas actually starts to kill off neurons. Hyperactivity doesn't always do this, but it turns out that if certain brain circuits are too active for too long, some of the chemicals associated with neuroactivity, things like calcium and neurotransmitters like glutamate can actually kill the very neurons that are active. So it seems that lithium can prevent some of that neurotoxicity. Now, this turns out to be particularly important for this discussion about bipolar disorder and the neural circuit basis of bipolar disorder because if we are just take a step back and ask, what's different in the brains of people with bipolar disorder?"}

Some of us feel tighter than others, sometimes in specific limbs or areas of our body, some people feel really loose and limb, some people even have what's called a hyper-flexibility. I, for instance, have a relative that can take her fingers and bend them back to the point where they touch her wrist. And it always makes me cringe a little bit, but she can do that without any pain, she seems to have some hyper-flexibility in her joints. I do not have that feature. Some of you may find that you are more flexible than others naturally, and some of you might be thinking you don't need to build in additional flexibility. Well, I think by the end of today's episode, you'll realize that almost all of us can benefit from having some sort of understanding about flexibility and having some stretching protocol that we incorporate into our life, if not just for physical performance reasons and for postural reasons, then also for cognitive and mental reasons, and I'll be sure to clarify what all of that means. Right now, I'd like to take a moment and just highlight the flexibility that you already have. For instance, if you were to move your arm behind your torso a little bit and then sort of let go or stop exerting any effort in doing that, you would find that the limb would return more or less to a position next to your torso, at least I would hope so. And why is that? Well, it turns out that there are aspects of your nervous system, aspects of your skeletal system, aspects of your muscles, and aspects of the connective tissue that binds all of that together, that try and restore a particular order or position to your limbs and your limbs relative to one another. So, that reflects a very specific set of processes that it turns out are the same set of processes that you use when you are trying to enhance flexibility and stretching."}
{"question": "Can certain serotonergic treatments effectively increase hunger and appetite in individuals with anorexia nervosa?", "doc_id": "2XGREPnlI8U_15", "video_id": "2XGREPnlI8U", "video_title": "Healthy Eating & Eating Disorders - Anorexia, Bulimia, Binging", "video_header": "Chemical Imbalances, Serotonergic Treatments", "segment_idx": "15", "time_start": "1:09:50", "time_end": "1:12:51", "context": "Meaning is there some disruption in one of the major chemical systems in the brain that makes anorexics anorexic and therefore, can we replace that chemical? Or can we reduce some chemical and essentially eliminate anorexia? And the answer is not really sort of maybe no, here's why, there are a lot of different chemicals in the brain and body, but there are a category of chemicals that are particularly important that if you've listened to this podcast before, even if you haven't are going to come up again and again and again, and that is the category of chemicals in the brain and body called the neuromodulators, neuromodulators are different than neuro-transmitters in the sense that neuromodulators modulator or change the activity of brain areas in neural circuits, you can think of them as microphones that are held between particular sets of connections in the brain that make those connections in the brain, more likely to be active relative to others, okay? They make them louder so to speak, there are many neuromodulators, but the ones that are important for sake of today's discussion are the classic ones, dopamine, acetylcholine, or epinephrin and serotonin. Let's focus on serotonin. Serotonin is a neuromodulator that tends to increase the activity of certain neural circuits, including within the hypothalamus, but also within the body that trigger a sense of satiety, of having enough, enough food, enough warmth, enough social connection, enough of any motivated goal or drive or any type of thing or behavior that one would want more of, serotonin tends to make those circuits quiet down. Now, there are many categories of drugs that emphasize the serotonergic circuitry, meaning they cause the release of, or the efficiency of serotonin in the brain and body. Things like Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, things of that variety. Those drugs have been used to some degree of success. Although not much to treat things like anorexia nervosa. That should make sense, because if these drugs increase serotonin, if their general effect is to increase serotonin, it will be to lower anxiety. That sounds like a great thing. A lot of anorexics are really anxious around food. We'll talk about why, lowering anxiety you might think would lead to ingestion of more food, but that's not often what happens, increasing serotonin, by way of some drug regimen will tend to make one less hungry, because with heightened levels of serotonin in the blood and brain, there isn't the desire to go seek out the things that will raise serotonin on their own. Now, some anorexics do well or benefit from these serotonergic drugs, these drugs that increase the activity of these circuits that leads to satiety. But if you think about the major goal of treating an anorexic it's to get them to have more hunger, more appetite. So, now I want to focus on some of the work that's been done"}
{"question": "What are some common emotional states or mindsets that can lead to a person feeling disconnected from the world and lacking motivation, and how can we identify and address these underlying issues?", "doc_id": "qPKd99Pa2iU_26", "video_id": "qPKd99Pa2iU", "video_title": "Dr. Paul Conti: How to Improve Your Mental Health | Huberman Lab Guest Series", "video_header": "Demoralization, Learned Helplessness", "segment_idx": "26", "time_start": "2:44:48", "time_end": "2:49:32", "context": "and pleasure drive and generative drive, for that matter, play out? For instance, we talked about the former patient of yours who eventually switched jobs, clearly had a generative drive within him, but it was being blocked by a number of choices rooted in narratives that originated in childhood, et cetera. We talked about individuals with high aggressive drive, high degree of pleasure drive, but a very diminished capacity to experience pleasure and therefore a lot of envy and the destruction that comes with envy. Paul Conti: Yes. Andrew Huberman: What are some of the other variations on these drives as you observe them in your clinical practice? Paul Conti: Well, our overall framing is we want the generative drive to be the one that's deterministic . It's the one with the strongest influence. So we want to nurture the generative drive in us and in others, and it makes sense for us to talk about that. But we've looked at how do things get out of balance. And from the perspective of, well, what if the aggressive drive or the pleasure drive. What if they're too high? Right? And then it makes sense that often, not always, what can be driving them to be so high are things that aren't healthy in us. Then the higher they get, the harder it is to gratify them. So we end up with that problem of envy. But we can be out of balance in the other direction too, where the person does not experience an ability to engage with the world around them. They don't think they can do anything to change anything for the better, inside or outside of themselves. And they're not doing much. They don't feel that they can do much and also not receiving pleasure from things. There's no gratification from the things a person is doing. Like, we see situations like this too, with the aggressive drive, the pleasure drive, or both. And then we end up not at envy, because envy is the side of excess, but we end up at demoralization on the lower side. Now, demoralization is not a specific psychiatric diagnosis. It can predispose to psychiatric problems like the biochemical abnormality of depression. But what we're talking about here is not a psychiatric diagnosis, right? Like envy is not a psychiatric diagnosis. It's a thing that can be experienced, that can lead to diagnoses. The same thing with demoralization. If you don't feel that you can make a difference to anything and you're not enjoying anything or feeling gratification from anything, then that pool is going to win out. That's going to be a demoralized person. The same way, of course, we know in experiments, when you have a rat going for food, if you do it enough, when the rat goes for the food and you take the food away, the rat stops trying. Andrew Huberman: And they learned helplessness, right? Paul Conti: That exists in us too. And it comes along with all sorts of other things. Because being not rats, we have a whole bunch of thoughts about that, of, oh my God, I'm not good enough and nothing will ever be. Okay. So demoralization then can be very strong in taking a person away from the other things we're trying to seek, either because that person has essentially the learned helplessness and all the things, the complicated things inside of us that can come along with that, or the person isn't gaining pleasure from anything. So when we're considering the ways in which we can be out of balance, we think, okay, aggression and pleasure drive, if one or the other or both is too high, we end up at envy. And if one or the other or both are too low, we end up with demoralization. And you can take almost any scenario. It could be a scenario of something that's just not really not going well for a person. It's not a clinical scenario, it's a thing in a person's life. Or we can take clinical scenarios and the vast majority outside of outliers, like a head injury, for example, we can take those scenarios and we can look at it in that way, and we can understand what's going on. At least we can understand enough that when we go back and look in the ten cupboards of the two pillars, we can then have some understanding of, okay, what is going on. We know the basic picture and how things are not in the balance we want them in now, we can understand that enough to go back and then look in those ten cupboards. And I believe that just about everything except those biological outliers, like a head injury, fits into that heuristic, which is why we can use it to understand, we can use it to help. We can use it to make change. Andrew Huberman: What a powerful lens to think about and explore the self and"}

{"question": "What is the Gate Theory of Pain and how does it explain the concept of pain relief through pressure and rubbing?", "doc_id": "xmhsWAqP_0Y_18", "video_id": "xmhsWAqP_0Y", "video_title": "How to Control Your Sense of Pain & Pleasure", "video_header": "Protocol 8: Pressure-Based Pain Relief, “Gate Theory of Pain (Relief)”", "segment_idx": "18", "time_start": "1:30:02", "time_end": "1:37:50", "context": "as it's called, our planning, our decision making, but also how we interpret context, what the meaning of a given sensation is. And that's extremely powerful. I just want to remind everybody that the currency of the brain and body has not changed in hundreds of thousands of years. It's always been dopamine, serotonin, glutamate, GABA, testosterone, estrogen. What's changed are the contingencies, the events in the world that drive whether or not we get an increase or decrease in testosterone or estrogen, the events in the world that dictate whether or not we get an increase or a decrease in dopamine. Believe me, the events that drove those increases and decreases were very different even a 100 years ago than they are now. And as we create new things and societies change, et cetera, they will continue to exchange information in the same currency, which is dopamine, serotonin, and all these other neuromodulators and chemicals. Hypnosis takes advantage of this by allowing an individual, you, if you like to change the way that you interpret particular events and to actually experience what would be painful as less painful or not painful. And that's just the example of pain. Hypnosis is powerful for other reasons too. It actually can help rewire neural circuits so that you don't experience as much pain so that you can sleep faster, focus faster. If this is all sounding very fantastical well, it's supported by data. The data are that when people do self-hypnosis even brief self-hypnosis of 10 or 15 minutes, a few times a week, maybe even returned to that hypnosis by just using a one minute a day hypnosis, they can achieve significant and often very impressive degrees of pain relief in chronic pain whether or not that chronic pain arises through things like fibromyalgia or through other sources. If you want to check this out, there's a wonderful zero cost resource that's grounded in this work. It's the app reveri.com. So R-E-V-E-R-I.com. There you can download a zero cost app for Apple phones or for Android phones. And there are a variety of different hypnosis scripts. These are actually self hypnosis scripts, and you'll actually hear Dr. David Spiegel talking to you. He can teach you about hypnosis and how it works. There are links to scientific studies that web address that I gave you before reveri.com. You can see the various studies and the various write-ups related to those studies and how this all works. And they're simple protocols. You just click on a tab and you listen to the self-hypnosis and it will take you into hypnosis. And several of those hypnosis grips have been shown clinically to relieve certain patterns of chronic pain. So it's a powerful tool, and I encourage you not to write off the non-drug non supplement tools as less than powerful because indeed many people experience tremendous relief from them. And of course, they also can be combined with drug treatments if that's right for you or with supplements and things of that sort to treat pain, if that's right for you. So again, electroacupuncture now often supported by insurance, not always, but often. Great mechanistic data starting to emerge. Hypnosis, terrific tool. There's even the self-hypnosis tool that one can access through the zero cost app Reveri and lots of great clinical data and scientific mechanistic data. There are neuro imaging studies showing that different brain areas are activated in hypnosis the so-called default network, kind of where your brains is kind of idols and the different circuits that are active in at rest shift with hypnosis and shift long-term in ways that positively conserve you. And then these things like laser photobiomodulation still more or less in that experimental medical community. I should say, Western Medical Community, not so certain, but hopefully there will be data soon, and hopefully those data will point to mechanisms that allow the insurance companies and other sort of medical bodies to support them if indeed they have a mechanistic basis. I just want to briefly touch on a common method of pain relief that speaks to a more general principle of how things like electroacupuncture, and also some of these new emerging techniques of kind of like active tissue release and this principle that you hear a lot about in sports medicine now that when you have pain or injury at one site, that you should provide pressure above and below that site. You may have seen this in the Olympics, which is ongoing now where people will put tape on their body at certain locations oftentimes. The logic or what they're saying is that this is designed to create relief in a joint or in a limb that's below the tape, not necessarily under the tape, but above or below. So for instance, if there's pain in one shoulder, sometimes we'll put it on the trapezius muscle or things of that sort. It turns out that there is a basis for this because of the way that these different nerves run in from the skin and from the muscles up into the spinal cord and into the brainstem providing pressure on one nerve pathway can often impact another pathway. And the simplest and most common example of this is one that we all do instinctually or intuitively even animals do this. This is something that in the textbooks is all is called the Gate Theory of Pain developed by Melzack and Wall kind of classic theory. Basically we have receptors in our skin, the so-called C fibers, that's just a name for these little wires that come from a particular class of DRGs that's very thin that brings about certain kinds of nasal scepter information. I want to say pain information, but then the pain people believe are not their pain people. Sometimes they're a pain because what they tell me is they're on pain receptors okay, nociceptors That information comes in C fibers and what happens when we injure something well, provided that we won't damage it worse by touching it, oftentimes what we will do is we will rub the source of pain or the location in which we were experiencing pain. And it turns out that's not an unuseful thing to do. When we rub our skin or an area, or we provide pressure nearby it, we activate the so-called A fibers, the bigger wires and neurons that innovate, meaning they jut into that area of skin. And those A fibers, the ones that respond to mechanical pressure actually are able to inhibit those C fibers, the ones that are carrying that so-called pain information. So rubbing an area or providing pressure above or below an injury actually provides real pain relief support for the location of that injury or that pain because of the way that these different patterns or these different types of neurons interact with one another. And when I say it inhibits it, I don't mean that it like shouts at it, what it does is it releases it's literally kind of like vomits up a little bit of a neurotransmitter called GABA. And GABA is a neurotransmitter that inhibits it quiets the activity of other neurons. And so it's acting as kind of an analgesic, if you will, it's acting as its own form of drug that you make with your body to quiet the activity of these pain neurons. So rubbing a wound provided it doesn't damage the wound worse or providing pressure above or below typically it's above a particular injury can have a real effect in relieving some of the pain of that injury. And some people have speculated this as through fascia, or this is through other bodily organs and tissues. And it might be we're going to do a whole episode on fascia. It's extremely interesting tissue, but right now it seems that the main source of that pain relief is through this A fiber inhibition of these C fibers so-called Melzack and Wall Gate Theory of Pain if you'd like to look it up and learn about that further. Now, let's talk about a phenomenon"}
{"question": "What are the potential benefits of having complete and error-free genomes for endangered species, and how could this information be used in conservation efforts?", "doc_id": "LVxL_p_kToc_21", "video_id": "LVxL_p_kToc", "video_title": "Dr. Erich Jarvis: The Neuroscience of Speech, Language & Music | Huberman Lab Podcast #87", "video_header": "Comparative Genomics, Earth Biogenome Project, Genome Ark, Conservation", "segment_idx": "21", "time_start": "1:40:23", "time_end": "1:48:22", "context": "to talk about some of the newer work that you're into right now about genomes of animals. As you perhaps can tell from my quite authentic facial expressions, I adore the animal kingdom. I just find it amazing. And it's the reason I went into neurobiology, in part. So many animals, so many different patterns of movement, so many body plans, so many specializations, what is the value of learning the genomes of all these animals? You know, I can think of conservation-based, you know, schemes of trying to preserve these precious critters, but what are you doing with the genomes of these animals? What do you want to understand about their brain circuits? And how does this relate to some of the discussion we've have been having up until now? - Yeah, I've gotten very heavily involved in genomes, you know, not just to get at an individual gene involved in the trade of interest, like spoken language, but I realize that, you know, nature has done natural experiments for us with all these species out there with these various traits and the one that I'm studying, like vocal learning, has evolved multiple times among the animal kingdom, even if it's rare, it's multiple times. And the similar genetic changes occurred in those species. But to find out what those genetic changes that are associated with the trait of interests and not some other trait like flying in birds, as opposed to singing, you have to do what's called comparative genomics, even in the context of studying the brain. And you need their genomes to compare the genomes and do like a GWA, a genome-wide association study, not just within a species like humans, but across species. And so you need good genomes to do that. Plus, I've discovered I'm also interested in evolution and origins. How did these species come about a similar trait in last, you know, 300 million years or 60 million years, depending who you're talking about. And you need a good phylogenetic tree to do that, and to get a good phylogenetic tree, you also need their genomes. And so, because of this, I got involved in large scale consortiums to produce genomes of many different species, including my vocal learners and their closest relatives that I'm fans of. But I couldn't convince the funding agencies to gimme the money to do that just for my own project. But when you get a whole bunch of people together who want to study various traits, you know, heart disease, or loss and gain in flight and so forth, suddenly we all need lots of genomes to do this. And so now that got me into a project to lead something called the Vertebrate Genomes Project to eventually sequence all 70,000 species on the planet. And Earth BioGenome Project, all eukaryotic species, all two million of them. And to no longer be in a situation where I wish I had this genome. Now we have the genetic code of all life on the planet, create a database of all their traits and find the genetic association with everything out there that makes a difference from one species to another. One more piece of the equation to add to this story is what I didn't realize as a neuroscientist were that these genomes are not only incomplete, but have lots of errors in them, false gene duplications, where mother and father chromosomes were so different from each other, that the genome algorithm, assembly algorithms treated them as two different genes in this part of the chromosome. So there are a lot of these false duplicated genes that people thought were real, but were not or missing parts of the genome because the enzymes used to sequence the DNA couldn't get through this regulatory region that folded up on itself and made it hard to sequence. And so I ended up in these consortiums pulling in the genome sequencing companies, developing the technology to work with us to improve it further and the computer science guys who then take that data and that technology, and try to make the complete genomes and make the algorithms better to produce what we now just did recently led by an effort by Adam Phillippy is the first human Telomere-to-Telomere Genome with no errors, all complete, no missing sequence. And now we're trying to do the same thing with vertebrates and other species. Actually, we improved that before we got to the, what we call telomere-to-telomere, from one end of the chromosome to another. And what we're discovering is in this dark matter of the genome that was missing before, turns out to be some regulatory regions that are specialized in vocal learning species and we think are involved in developing speech circuits. - Incredible. Well, so much to learn. And we're going to learn from this information. Early on in these genome projects and connectome projects, I confess I was a little bit cynical. This would be about 10, 15 years ago. I thought, okay, necessary, but not sufficient for anything. We need it, but it's not clear what's going to happen, but you just gave a very clear example of what we stand to learn from this kind of information. And I know from the conservation side, there's a huge interest in this because even though we would prefer to keep all these species alive rather than clone them, these sorts of projects do offer the possibility of potentially recreating species that were lost. - Right. - Due to our own ignorance or missteps, or what have you. - Yes, and along those lines, because, you know, we got involved in genomics, some of the first species that we start working on are critically endangered species. And I'm doing that not only for, you know, perspectives to understand their brains and the genes involved in their brain function, but I feel like it's a moral duty. So the fact that now I become more involved in genome biology and have helped develop these tools for more complete genomes, let's capture their genetic code now, before they're gone. And could we use that information to resurrect the species at some future time, if not in my lifetime, in some time in the future and generations ahead of us. And so, in anticipation of that, we create a database, we call the GenomeArk and no pun intended like Noah's Ark, meant to store the genetic code as complete genome assemblies as possible for all species on the planet to be used for basic science, but also some point in the future. And because of that, funding agencies or private foundations that are interested in conservation have been reaching out to me now, a neuroscientist, to help them out in producing high quality genome data of endangered species that they can use, like Revive & Restore, who want to resurrect the passenger pigeon or Colossal, who wants to resurrect the wooly mammoth. And so we're producing high quality genomes for these groups, for the conservation projects. - What a terrific and important initiative. And I think for those listening today, they now certainly understand the value of deeply understanding the brain structures and genomes of different species. Because I confess, even though I knew a bit of the songbird literature, and I certainly understand that humans have speech and language, I had no idea that there was so much convergence of function, structure and genomes. And to me, you know, I feel a lot more like an ape than I do a songbird. - Right. - And yet here we are with the understanding that there's a lot more similarity between songbirds and humans than I certainly ever thought before. - Yeah, something very close to home for us humans, I can give you an example of is evolution of skin color."}

"time_end": "57:57", "context": "apply that is they are the Cornerstone for mood and mental health regardless of who you are regardless of your age regardless of whether or not you're dealing with an acute or a severe mood or mental health disorder or you find yourself to be reasonably healthy with respect to mood and mental health and you simply want your mood and mental health to be stable and or improve over time time now the reason why the big six those six pillars are so important for mood and mental health and indeed form a critical component of what Dr Paul kti referred to as the first principles of self-care is that those six pillars establish a millu that is an environment of neurochemicals including neuromodulators such as dopamine serotonin epinephrine norepinephrine acetylcholine and other neurochemicals as well as well as hormones to testosterone estrogen prolactin cortisol and immune molecules and on and on that lead to a high degree of predictability in your brain and nervous system now what do I mean by that why would predictability be such a key component of mood and mental health is it really just about knowing that you're going to feel energized in the early part of the day and tired at the end of the day now that might be part of it but that's not the major takeaway the major takeaway is that as Dr Lisa Feldman Barrett so aptly point pointed out your brain and indeed your entire nervous system has a couple of major jobs you know it has the job of regulating your breathing and your heart rate Etc it also has the job of regulating your thinking and your planning and your memory those are the jobs of the brain and nervous system that we normally hear about but if we think about the more macro jobs that the brain has the key function of the brain certainly the parts of the brain that are more recently evolved the ones involved in thinking and planning Etc are really involved involved in generating predictions predictions about what's going to happen next and whether or not you're going to be prepared for what's going to happen next and indeed Dr Lisa Felman Barrett also beautifully Illustrated this model of the brain as regulating a brain body budget and moods and a related topic which she called affect okay I'll explain what affect is in a moment setting the stage for being able to better predict what's going to happen next and therefore regulating your mood in the moment let's just take a moment and explore that statement in a little bit more detail essentially what she was saying and what I'm now again saying is that your brain and body go through different states your state at a given moment can be labeled as your affect your affect includes a lot of different things including levels of autonomic arousal levels of hormones levels of transmitters all of that stuff but it falls under the umbrella of affect affect essentially sets the stage for particular emotions to be more likely or less likely to emerge so emotion and affect aren't the same thing affect is a bit more General and sort of undergirds the possibility of having certain moods like feeling elated happy or sad or depressed it really sets the general stage for different types of specific emotions even highly specific emotions so in that way when you're taking care of the big six when you're tending to these six pillars on a regular basis and I should point out that we really want to tend to those six pillars every single day or every single 24 hours we really need to make those a regular investment to the extent that we can when we do that we create a neurochemical and a neural milu that allows the brain to be in a better predictive state it allows the brain to give rise to a certain aex spelled a CS so affex that lead to certain emotions being more or less likely to occur put very simply when we're tending to those six pillars on a regular basis we feel better more generally and therefore the emotions that we tend to have under different conditions even conditions of a difficult interaction with a cooworker or with a family member tend to be more positive than if we are not tending to those six pillars now in some sense that's sort of a duh statement for instance if you're sleep deprived if you're not fed well like you haven't eaten in a few hours of course you're going to be more irritable you're going to be more reactive you are going to be more emotionally labile but sleep and nutrition are just two of those six core pillars when we talk about those core pillars and the necessity for tending to them on a regular every 24-hour basis what we're really talking about is creating a millu within our brain and nervous system that allows the nervous system to do what it does best and in fact what its main job is to do which is to predict what's going to happen next because as Lisa Feldman Barrett pointed out emotions are really context dependent states that allow us to navigate not just our present circumstances but they are our nervous system and brain's best guess about the circumstances that we are soon going to encounter now I don't offer you all of that as kind of a a bunch of you know Tangled mess of nerd speak to confuse you what I'm saying is that by tending to those six core pillars you are shifting the likely aects that you will EXP exp erience and therefore the likely emotions that you'll experience so you're biasing your whole system towards more positive affect and more positive emotions regardless of what your life circumstances happen to be and the stressors that you encounter and indeed you also are including that six pillar of stress control so when those stressors arrive you will be better able to navigate them now this view of emotion regulation of mood and mental health is certainly not a novel concept people have talked about the physiological regulation of mood from the time of William James and even earlier you know it's been a long-standing question for instance or debate in Psychology and philosophy you know do we feel anxiety in our body and then label it as anxiety or do we feel anxiety in our mind and then our body follows that's been a long-standing debate and frankly there's evidence on both sides which leads me to the conclusion I think most neurobiologists and psychologists to the conclusion that those things are interrelated in a way that we can't really dissociate them completely at any level right when your heart rate goes up and you start breathing thing faster you know if I were to induce that state in you you'd probably interpret that as feeling anxious in addition to that something can make you anxious before your heart rate and breathing increases and then your heart rate and breathing increases so no need to tease those apart but if you think about the brain in large part as a prediction machine and your brain as a metabolic regulator it's trying to decide which organs need resources how much resource can I dedicate to thinking to creativity to enjoying social interaction to paying attention to what somebody else is is saying as opposed to what's going on inside my body all of those major functions of the brain as they relate to affect and emotions are going to be best supported that is biased toward positive mood positive affect positive emotions and therefore positive mental health outcomes when we're tending to those six pillars Dr Lisa feldin Barrett referred to that whole process as the brain regulating a brain body budget and she had beautiful analogies for that budget and that's what led to the description of social interactions is either generating savings or being neutral or generating a taxed feeling literally taxing that brain body budget and I love that concept and it's one that you can keep in mind and indeed we can inject a lot of specificity into this whole process of improving mood and mental health through specific protocols if you simply remember if you make a daily investment in the six core pillars you are building up that brain body budget you will have more energetic resources to spend on whatever life circumstances come your way

This is a serious concern. The discussion is happening now. The underlying neurobiological mechanisms you now understand. And this isn't to pass judgment on whether or not people like or don't like pornography, that's an ethical discussion, and it's a moral discussion that has to be decided for each individual by virtue of age, et cetera.

{"question": "What is the role of the gut's neuropod cells in driving our preference for sweet foods, and how do these cells contribute to our intense cravings for sugary foods?", "doc_id": "VAEzZeaV5zM_11", "video_id": "VAEzZeaV5zM", "video_title": "Controlling Sugar Cravings & Metabolism with Science-Based Tools | Huberman Lab Podcast #64", "video_header": "Subconscious Sugar Circuits, Hidden Sugars in Food", "segment_idx": "11", "time_start": "48:45", "time_end": "57:58", "context": "you perceive that sweet taste and a cascade ensues within your brain that makes you want more of the sweet thing. That's the conscious pathway for sugar perception, for sweet perception. Now there's the second pathway, the second pathway is what's called the post-ingestive reinforcing properties of sugar, which is really just a fancy nerd speak way of saying there are events that happen within your stomach and below your conscious detection, that are also driving you to seek out sweet tasting things, independent of their taste, and foods that increase blood glucose, independent of their taste. In order to illustrate the immense power of these subconscious circuits for sugar seeking, I'd like to describe an experiment. And this is just one experiment of many, of dozens or more experiments done in animal models and humans, which essentially illustrate the same thing. And as I describe this experiment, I think you will come to understand the power of these circuits. I'll provide a link to this study in the caption. The first author is Freeman. The paper was published in Frontiers in Bioscience, but there have been others, papers in Nature Neuroscience, papers in Neuron, Cell Press journals, et cetera, many, many journals, many, many papers. If subjects are given the choice of drinking plain water or a sweet tasting fluid, their preference for the sweet tasting fluid is much, much higher, right? Sweet tastes better than plain water, at least for most people and certainly for animals. Now, if, for instance, you take an animal which completely lacks sweet receptors, and you can do this through some molecular genetic tools and gymnastics in the laboratory, we call these knockout mice, where you can knock out a particular receptor for sweet taste, you can confirm that there's no perception of sweet things or at least no preference for sweet things in those animals. In humans, you can numb the mouth, there are other pharmacologic ways that you can eliminate sweet receptors in the mouth. And by doing that, you people will tell you, no, I can't taste anything sweet. You could give them a ice cream, you could give them pure sucrose, you could give them table sugar, and they wouldn't be able to perceive it as sweet. If you eliminate the perception of sweet taste in the mouth and you offer people or laboratory animals, water versus some sugar containing solution, you eliminate the preference for the sugary solution. Which tells us that the perception of sweet is important for the preference for sweet tasting drink. This is also true for sweet tasting foods, I should mention. However, in both animal models and in humans, after about 15 minutes, subjects start preferring the sugary water, even though they can't taste that it is sweeter. So to repeat that, if you eliminate the ability to sense sweet, to perceive sweetness in foods, then you eliminate the preference for sweet beverages or sweet foods. So that's not surprising. But if you wait about 15 minutes, the preference for the sweet beverage or the sweet food comes back. Now that doesn't mean that they can perceive the sweetness. In fact, the way these experiments are done is very clever. You offer people various cups of different things or different food items. And then you just look at what they eat more of or what they prefer to eat more of. So this experiment is so crucial because what it says is that the preference for sugar containing foods is in part due to the sweetness of those foods, but in part due to something else. And this something else is what we call the post-ingestive effect, and as I mentioned before, it took about 15 minutes. And you've actually experienced this, whether you realize it or not, this phenomenon of post-ingestive rewarding properties of sweet foods, meaning what happens in your body when you ingest something that increases your blood glucose very much, has no doubt controlled you from the inside, below your awareness, this was happening to you and you didn't realize it. And here's how it works. We all have neurons within our gut. These neurons have a name, they're called neuropod cells. Neuropod cells were famously discovered by Professor, Dr. Diego Bohorquez at Duke University. And these cells respond to, among other things, to the presence of sugar within the gut. So when we ingest a sugary food or drink, or we ingest a food or drink that simply contains fructose, sucrose, glucose, or some other form of sugar that later, through metabolism, will be converted into glucose, the neuropod cells are able to register the presence of those sweet or glucose stimulating foods. And in response to that, send electrical signals, because electrical signals are the way neurons communicate, up to the brain, via the so-called vagus nerve. The vagus nerve, of course, being a nerve pathway, famous for its role in relaxation. That's kind of the assumption out there, that it's always involved in relaxation, that's not the case. It's involved in a lot of things besides relaxation. But nonetheless, these neuropod cells send electrical signals through a particular highway within the vagus to the so-called nodose ganglion, and this is a cluster, a ganglion is just a cluster of neurons. And then the nodose ganglion sends on information to the nucleus of the solitary tract. The nucleus of the solitary tract is an area of the brain that we're going to talk about extensively today. It's very important for understanding sugar preference. These neuropod cells also trigger activation of dopamine pathways within the mesolimbic reward pathway. In other words, there are signals conveyed from the gut, meaning stomach and intestines, to the brain anytime we ingest sweet foods, but it has nothing to do with our perception of them being sweet, it has everything to do with the fact that sweetness of food is almost always correlated with an ability to increase blood glucose. And the net effect of this is a parallel pathway by which dopamine is increased further. Now, the experiment that I described before of animals or humans ingesting something that contains sugar, but not being able to perceive its sweetness, and yet, after a period of time, still preferring that food or drink to non-sugar containing food or drinks, even though they can't distinguish their taste, is dependent on these neuropod cells and related pathways. What this may for you is that anytime you eat something sweet, that substance is actually causing your gut, your stomach and your intestine, or to be more precise, I should say, that substance, food substance, is causing the neuropod cells in your stomach and intestines to send a parallel set of signals up to your brain saying, eat more of that, or simply eat more, eat more, eat more, and preferably eat more sweet foods. So we've all heard of hidden sugars, meaning the sugars that manufacturers have put into foods and disguised them with other flavors. I talked about this in the episode on salt, using salt to mask the taste of sweetness so that people ingest more sugar. That is not an accident that hidden sugars are often hidden with salt or with other flavors. It's done so that people will, meaning you or me, will want to ingest more of a particular food, independent of how sweet that food tastes. And in fact, some crackers, for instance, chips for instance, you might think, oh, well, you know, chips, they're not sweet, they're salty and savory. And again, I'll mention, I love salty and savory foods, including certain foods, I love kettle chips, for instance, I try not to walk by them in the grocery store. I usually have to eat one bag while I'm in the store, and then another later. The savory foods are often laden with these hidden sugars that we can't register as sweetness, but trigger the neuropod cells, which then further trigger dopamine, which make us want more of them. Now we may be able to resist eating more of them, but it makes us crave more food in general. Now we will talk about ways to regulate this pathway, to sort of intervene in this subconscious pathway. But for now I'm hoping that just the understanding that we all have this pathway, this is hardwired into our body, could potentially allow people to better understand why is it that their cravings are so intense, that it's not necessarily just about the taste of that food. And when you consider this in concert with the fact that we have this dopamine pain pleasure balance, excuse me, that I referred to earlier, you start to realize that there are multiple mechanisms hardwired into us, that make it especially hard to not eat the sweet thing or to not eat the food that we're craving. And indeed, that's the case. We have two major accelerators. It's like a car with two accelerators, and we will talk about the brakes, but two ways that really get us into forward motion toward pursuing the consumption of sweet foods. Now, if it doesn't already seem diabolical enough,"}

irti of stages of life I agree if people haven't seen those stages we'll put a link to them in the show note captions but the idea is that you're basically grappling with some basic struggle that you either reconcile or you don't at every stage so you could imagine that these let's say these three marriages let's imagine a couple that meets in their 20s and does three marriages which implies uh a couple divorces in between maybe not legal divorces um across their lifespan they really are according to the Ericson theory development or any neurobiological examination of brain development different people in their 20s versus 40s versus 60s 70s 80s so this notion of three different marriages to me seems um both logical and very grounded in what we know about the biology of the the brain and the self so um a good metaphor is rooted in science and and yet it's also kind of a radical idea when one hears it for the first time if framed in the context of with the same person it sounds kind of lovely and romantic okay they meet it's lovely they have their first marriage then there's some challenge they overcome they do a second marriage then some Challenge and a third marriage and maybe there's even grandchildren you imagine maybe even great grandchild there's all this kind of uh romantic Notions built up around it but then there's also the reality that for many people more than half there's a fracture of the first marriage and that they either remain single or marry again and so what do you think dictates whether or not a person can go through these series of evolutions and actually find and create love again and again and again either with the same person or with someone new or in some cases I guess three different partners I mean mean what what is the sort of um requirement is it a a willingness to accept this model and understand that who they are at 50 is going to be very different than who they were in their 20s you know a good question is a question that has many answers there's different ways to answer this um I think that more than thinking about it as they were able able to overcome crisis it's really the ability to redefine oneself and to redefine a relationship it's much more creative than problem solving you can overcome a crisis and put it aside and stay the same this is much more of a of a generative experience it's a creative experience is that you actually become a different unit the power Dynamic is different the interdependence is different the the erotic charge is different the the the the connection to the outside world is different it's it's really it's it's it's en liven the you know I think everybody understands the difference between a relationship that is not dead and a relationship that is alive I I am not there to help people survive I my work would is is about more than that it's about helping people to feel alive and the redefinition of having the same relationship with the same person it has to be alive not just not dead and if sometimes that alive means recreating a new you know going to a new person a new country a new city a new Social Circle a new profession a new a lot of things that we today have access to to change things that people did once you know when I ask an audience if your grandparents grew up in the same neighborhood or in the same town and worked in the same company I mean most people rais their hands and then I go down the generations and then now it's like how many how many of you have had three jobs in The Last 5 Years so this notion that we can create new things for ourselves is actually one of the greatest things that has happened in the realm of relationships we can have kids much later we can join somebody who has already had those children we can marry in our 60s for the first time we can live in a in a trip trism we can there's a plasticity if you want to use a word that you that to to the world of relationship today that is extremely rich and expansive but Demands a set of skills to negotiate to understand the uncertainty that comes from having to make so many decisions at the time with in the past none of us made decisions about most of these things they were handed down to us so that level of freedom is utterly rich but comes with a tremendous amount of anxiety and the man's maturity and sometimes couples have become so entrenched and so locked in their story and confusing their story with the truth and feeling that they're living next to someone who has a completely different version of the story that they cannot talk to like there is no greater polarization sometimes than a couple that once agreed on a lot of things that you just think there there's no way change can end enter this system okay so when I hear your answer um what

And some of you may be familiar with this type of movement, but I'm guessing you're probably not familiar with what I'm about to tell you, which is that shiver or shivering is a strong stimulus for the release of adrenaline epinephrin into fat and the increase in fat oxidation and mobilization. But shiver is not just induced by cold, and there are other subtle forms of movement that can greatly increase fat metabolism and fat loss. There was a group in England during the 1960s and 70s that discovered a pathway by which subtle forms of movement can greatly increase fat loss. This is the work of Rothwell and Stock. It's very famous in the thermogenesis literature. And I learned about this early on, when I was an undergraduate and I asked, how did they come across this? And here's how the story goes. They were aware that some people overeat and yet don't put on weight. Other people overeat even just a little bit and they seem to accumulate extra adipose tissue. Now, this is long before all the discussions about microbiome and hormone factors, you know it was long before many of the hormone factors besides insulin had even been discovered. What they did was they examined people who overate and did not gain weight. And what they observed was that those people engaged in lots of subtle movement throughout the day. In other words, they were fidgeters. And that's what they call them. I'm not going to do the British accent version of fidgeters. But Roth and Stock were British. What they found were people that overeat but don't gain weight as a consequence. And in fact, many people who had low levels of body fat had a lot of resting tremor, not of the Parkinsonian type, but they would bounce their knee while they were sitting, when they would talk, they would engage in very angular movements, they were sort of electric. In fact, now in science, I was chuckling about this as I was diving back into this literature, because the other day I heard a wonderful lecture on a totally different topic from a colleague of mine and we all adore him. He's over in Europe and he's this tremendously successful scientist. So we like to poke fun at him. And every one of his movements is incredibly electric and staccato. And he's rail thin and he eats like a horse. And so it fits very well into the discovery of Rothwell and Stock who discovered that fidgeters people that bounce their knee, people that have a head bob while they're listening, people that nod a lot, people that stand up and sit down a lot throughout the day, and people that pace burn anywhere from 800 to 2,500 calories more than the control group in the experiments that they looked at. And indeed, there's been a modern look into all this, and these numbers check out that simply moving around a lot, even if those are subtle movements, greatly increases the amount of energy that you burn. And people who overeat, the people who can have the second or the third doughnut or doughnuts at all and don't seem to put on weight to the same degree, they are people that move around a lot even when seated. They're are people that will often move their limbs very quickly as well. There even have been studies that have explored other things that correlate with fidgeters. Fidgeters stand up very quickly at the end of a lecture or they start to gather their things very quickly, whereas non fidgeters don't. So dogs like my bulldog Costello, definitely not a fidgeter. Every movement is incredibly slow and deliberate. Sitting down as a process, if you ask him to sit down and sort of a slow motion. You ask him to get up and he kind of looks at you sighs and stands up. The fidgeter is the opposite of that, right? You say, how are you doing? They go, great. So even sometimes their speech will be accelerated although not always. But staccato movements, fidgeting, et cetera. And in 2015, and again in 2017, there've been studies that have explored this, using some modern metabolic tracking and indeed simply moving a lot, being a fidgeter, bouncing your knee, standing up and pacing several times or many times throughout the day led to considerable amounts of fat loss and weight loss when people were ingesting the same amount of food, if they overate, they were able to compensate and burn off that food. And if they were trying to lose weight and they incorporated this fidgeting protocol of deliberately trying to fidget more and move around during the day, pace, stand up more quickly, sit down more often, sit down and stand up more often rather. They found that they greatly increased their weight loss anywhere from 20 to 30% increases. And in some cases, you know, there always those few people who burned a lot more. It seems to work best in people who are already slightly overweight. So for people that are overweight, who are kind of averse to exercise, fidgeting might actually be a good entry point. And 800 to 2,500 calories is a considerable amount of calories when you really think about it. Now, why am I telling you this? Well, there's clearly a tool to export from this, which is that you can increase the amount of calories burned without having to go on additional long runs. I do hope that people are exercising regularly because it's so important for other aspects of brain and body health. But nonetheless, we are all time limited and we are not all so ready to embrace exercise. I have a family member who has been slowly coaxed into exercise, but if I were to tell her, for instance, you need to fidget more, she'd probably go for it. So this is a powerful way to increase the calories that are burned. Now, that's great. And you can think about the protocols. But I want to nest that protocol in what I said before,"}

{"question": "Is taking a daily dose of fish oil (at least 1000mg of EPA) sufficient to effectively treat both forms of depression, including those with uncertainty and those with certainty, and can it be used as a complement to traditional antidepressant medications?", "doc_id": "XfURDjegrAw_22", "video_id": "XfURDjegrAw", "video_title": "How Foods and Nutrients Control Our Moods", "video_header": "Fish Oil as Antidepressant", "segment_idx": "22", "time_start": "1:01:01", "time_end": "1:02:36", "context": "you would find that there were a number of really impressive results showing that it's at least as effective as certain SSRI antidepressants at these dosages and it can amplify or improve the effect of low dosages of some of these SSRIs. So I feel like more people should know about this. This is nutrition, but it's profoundly affecting mood and depression is terrible, right? Depression can have a component of anxiety in some cases where people are they feel lousy and very uncertain. That's kind of how I talk about depression with anxiety is you talk to someone who is anxious and you can tell them everything's gonna be okay. And they're always concerned about what they might not know. You don't really know the plane isn't gonna crash. You don't really know that life is gonna go okay. And in some sense, they're right, no one has a crystal ball or can predict the future, but they tend to perseverate or fixate on the uncertainty. And then of course there are the versions of depression that involve certainty. People are lethargic and they're certain they say, yeah, I'm certain, I'm never gonna get another job. I'm certain, I'm never gonna meet anyone new. I'm certain I'm gonna fail. So there's this kind of a divide in the sphere of depression around certainty and uncertainty. But what's interesting is this thousand milligrams per day or more of EPA has been shown to relieve both forms of depression. Now, does that mean it's gonna work for everybody? No, I'm not here to try and play psychiatrist. I want to point you in the direction of these manuscripts so that you can make informed choices for yourself. You can discuss it with your doctor and family and make the choices that are right for you. But here's what's especially interesting about the heart effects, because we've heard that these omega-3s, which of course you can get from other sources too, you can get from fatty fish, they're in flax seeds, hemp seeds."}
{"question": "What are the different approaches or protocols for implementing the ketogenic diet, and how do they vary depending on a person's current weight and health status?", "doc_id": "xjEFo3a1AnI_22", "video_id": "xjEFo3a1AnI", "video_title": "Dr. Chris Palmer: Diet & Nutrition for Mental Health", "video_header": "Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss", "segment_idx": "22", "time_start": "2:23:46", "time_end": "2:35:40", "context": "I have a question about-- or more of a statement/question about the ketogenic diet. Based on everything that we've talked about, seems to me that the ketogenic diet for weight loss is a very interesting aspect of the diet as is intermittent fasting for weight loss even though it might just be by way of caloric restriction that occurs with fasting. But then in some ways, the effects of the ketogenic diet on weight loss are a bit of a decoy for most people. That's where their mind goes. This person lost X amount of weight. Maybe that made them feel better. Maybe that actually made them underweight. I think you've talked about it. For some people, it can actually bring them under weight. I'm glad that we got the chance to dive into the description of ketogenic diet for epilepsy because it really is a medical intervention that has a side effect of weight loss or could be used to treat obesity and induce weight loss. But it's really about far more than that. And that raises a question for me, which is-- we've been talking about the ketogenic diet as one thing. But I've heard you discuss this before, where just as a physician will prescribe different dosage ranges of a given drug, you can prescribe different dosage ranges of a nutritional plan, a diet. It's not one thing. It's not necessarily zero carbohydrates or 100 grams or 50 grams. It depends on the patient and a lot of other factors. I've heard you list off various things classic keto. Maybe you could just briefly tell us what that typically is, because I think most people think it means eating a lot of meat and not carbohydrates. But it might not be that. Fasting and then some of the other-- you mentioned Atkins earlier. We don't have to go into each of these in detail. And I know in your book, you talk about not just the science and clinical background but also some actionable steps that people could consider. So they can refer there for more detail. But for somebody who, let's say, is depressed-- they've had some rounds of depression. Maybe they're on antidepressants, maybe not-- and they want to try something like this. Obviously, this has to be done in concert with a physician observing all this. But what is the typical thing that you probe with first? Just like with a drug, you might probe with 20 milligrams of a drug. What's your typical initial dietary intervention probe? Terrible languaging, I realize. And I'm criticizing myself for that. But I think people get the idea. CHRIS PALMER: The real answer is that I don't have a one-size-fits-all recommendation for any person. So the first thing that I'm going to assess with the patient is, what symptoms are they having? What is their current diet like? And what are they willing to do? I try to meet them where they're at. So if somebody-- and I want to point out. You mentioned the all-meat version of this diet, which is often referred to as the carnivore diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Very controversial diet. CHRIS PALMER: There is no doubt that exists. Some people swear by it. They swear they've tried other versions of ketogenic diets and only when they went to a carnivore diet did they get benefits. But there are vegetarian and vegan versions of the ketogenic diet. So in my mind, this is not at all about the diet wars of animal-sourced versus plant-sourced foods. It's about inducing a state of ketosis, which is mimicking the fasting state. That is what it's about. And you can do that by not eating anything, by fasting and/or intermittent fasting. And you get your results. So no diet is a ketogenic diet. So it's not about the foods or the types of foods that you're eating. It's about inducing a state of ketosis. The first variable I'm going to look at when I recommend this or prescribe this is the person's current weight. If somebody is obese versus somebody who's thin, I'm going to use different dietary strategies for those two situations. In the obese patient, they have tons of fat stores on their body already. Usually, it is a goal of theirs to tap into some of those. And they'd like to lose some weight if they're going to try a ketogenic diet for brain health anyway. And so I'm going to use that. So that person, really, the diet is carbohydrate restriction. And that usually is a sufficient intervention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Both simple carbohydrates, meaning sugars and fructose also? CHRIS PALMER: Fructose, definitely. So no added sugars, essentially. You can have added natural sweeteners like stevia or monk fruit. You might use artificial sweeteners. Years of doing this, I'd probably recommend steer away from them if you can because I think they tend to stimulate cravings for high carb foods. So if you can kind of get through a couple of weeks without sweet things, your cravings for those will go down. And it'll make the diet easier and a little more sustainable. But let's say you can have your artificial sweeteners, if that's what you really want. So I'm going to say less than 20 grams of carbs a day for those people. They can have all the protein they want. They can have vegetables. And they can have all the fat they want. But I'm not going to push fat on those people. I'm not going to tell them, eat a lot of fat, at the same time because I want to use the fat on their body as the fat source, at least early on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Are you encouraging healthy fats like monounsaturated fats, like olive oil? Are you encouraging people to eat a little less butter, et cetera? CHRIS PALMER: I tend to encourage, again, a wide range of fats. And it's going to depend on the person. A lot of times, people come to me with very specific ideas. But I'm going to tend to encourage olive oil, avocados, nuts, which are usually considered, even by the American Heart Association, healthy sources of fat. The more controversial thing are things like coconut oil or coconut cream, which the American Heart Association might say is not a healthy fat, I kind of disagree with that and don't think it's unhealthy at all actually. And when you look at the epidemiological studies of saturated fat causing heart disease or causing adverse outcomes, at best, maybe increases your risk 10% to 15%-- at best. ANDREW HUBERMAN: How much coconut oil can people ingest, anyway, before they either develop diarrhea-- no joke-- or just sort of get tired of coconut oil? Anyway, your point is taken. But they can eat meat if they like meat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Or they can eat eggs. Or if they don't like meat and eggs, they could eat sardines or things of that sort. I personally can't-- I can't even stomach the-- I don't even like the word \"sardine.\" I have nothing against the actual fish. But that's just me. But obviously, people have-- I say this because people have different preferences, right? CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'll eat a steak. But I'm not going to eat a sardine. CHRIS PALMER: And I'm going to go with that. And again, there are vegan sources of protein that-- people can eat tempeh and other things. So that's the obese person. It's carb restriction as the primary initial phase. The thin person is going to need to eat a lot of fat because they don't have a lot of fat stores on their body. And if I want them in ketosis, clinical ketosis, I'm going to have to feed them fat. So that's the person that I'm going to say, make sure you get in avocados, olive oil, butter, maybe heavy cream. So heavy cream is delicious. It's a delicious way to get your fats in. I have one patient who just drinks it straight, to just try to get it in. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I get it. I've never had an appetite for sweets. I absolutely love savory fatty food. When I was in high school, I was thin. So I was able to do this. But I used to drink half-and-half. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and drink it just because it tastes so, so good. CHRIS PALMER: It does taste good. So if they're on a ketogenic diet, I'm going to push them away from half-and-half and toward heavy whipping cream. So you can whip that up. You can freeze it. It turns into ice cream. You can add vanilla. You can add cocoa powder. You can add all sorts of things. And you're off to the races with shakes, and ice cream, and mousse, and all sorts of things that you can have. With any of these patients, the beauty of this diet is I have objective biomarkers. I'm going to have them measuring ketones. And I'm going to adjust the diet based on their state of ketosis and/or the clinical benefits that I'm looking for. If it's an average person, who is not currently under psychiatric care, not taking prescription medicines but is saying, I'm burned out. I'm exhausted. I want some of that brain energy that Andrew Huberman is talking about. He talks about feeling good. I want some of that. I'm probably actually going to recommend the protocol you describe, which is, let's see if we can just carb restrict for a while and see if that produces clinical benefit. I have one-- he's not even a patient, just somebody who read my book. I didn't tell him anything. And he came away from it saying-- he was ready to start an antidepressant for his anxiety. He had chronic anxiety, was trying meditation, was trying all sorts of things. Nothing-- those things weren't enough. He was ready to go on prescription medicine. He read an early copy of the book. He took it upon himself without consulting with me to restrict carbohydrates alone. He did not go ketogenic. He is a vegetarian. He restricted carbs. Within three weeks, said, I don't need prescription medicine. I can't believe how much better I feel. And all I did was cut out some of the high carb foods in my diet. So I think for some people, it can be that simple. For people with serious mental disorders, if they are chronically depressed, if they're on lots of prescription meds, if they're disabled by their symptoms, and certainly, if you're bipolar or have schizophrenia or something, those are the people I really do want them to work with a medical professional because meds may need to be adjusted. They need a real shot at this diet. It's not like weight loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. And either you're successful or you aren't. You look on the internet or you read a book or you do-- even the colleague that you mentioned, he's probably just reading-- who knows whether it's credible information or not-- and just winging it, and seeing whether it works or not. For people with serious mental disorders, I want you to treat it like you have epilepsy because you do have a serious brain disorder. It's impairing your ability to function in the world. It's impairing your health and happiness. You deserve a competent medical treatment. And we have that. We have a hundred-year evidence-based. We've got dieticians who know this like the back of their hand. They can monitor your level of ketosis. They can help look for vitamin and nutrient deficiencies that can be a consequence of the diet, and make sure that you're not developing those. They can help tweak the diet if needed. They can give you ideas if you're getting bored with eggs every morning. They can give you ideas for what else you might have. And if you're using it to treat a serious disorder, I think you need serious help."}

Is it does it begin with an awareness, with practice, or both? - It begins with education. You know, that's probably the most stable point of entry, awareness to some something as a concept that it is a concept, that there is validity, or because sometimes people look for that to looking at this entity, this open entity. And that's part of the reason why answering questions is not something I can do or even attempt to do. I believe in the power of the non-complete process, like making this table, but living something undone, not perfecting the product, why? Because it offers some kind of a dynamic nature of evolution that naturally unravels from it. Almost like sometimes I do it, I count reps and I'll only count to nine 'cause it tends to leave people in the count and it keeps going instead of giving them the 10. - Everyone wants to end on 10. - Yeah, which is because of the decimal system, et cetera. So, all kinds of things like that is also important with the movement idea is to discuss, to examine, to look, to taste, to try, but then also not to try to capture because if you like the invisible loop of Hoffstadt. If you look at it too closely, it's gone, but if you look away, it functions and exists just like us very powerfully and obviously gives us the experiences that we have. So, when people enter movement practice, it is about education, bringing some awareness to the fact that they are living in a body, that they are living in motion, that their mind is a type of movement, that their life is a type of movement. Bringing attention to the movement of the emotions as well. Bringing just attention to the fact that things are in motion. The Heraclitus panta rhei, all in flux, nothing stops besides something that is the background of it and allows it to express, and this is the beauty of things. And this for me is the movement practice is this examination and bringing this awareness into things. As we sit now here, I'm also aware of my body, I'm also aware of the way that things make me feel, the way that your face is communicating to me. And I'm not just in some limited and very verbal, overly verbal state because it misses a lot of the beautiful flux. - I'm going to inject some or project some ideas, and perhaps you would tell me if they're ridiculous,"}

that's drink element.com huberman yeah would like to drill into the concept of context and task switching a bit more uh I do think that the brain has something akin to a transmission system where you know for people that drive and have driven you know the the amount of energy that needs to be used in order to accelerate a vehicle to get up to a you know higher gear it's very different than the um equal amount of increase in speed at a given gear right so it's sort of the this is you hear this if you're not familiar with Transmissions say it sounds like it sounds as if there's it's more fasile at at higher speeds well how could it be that you're burning less fuel at a higher speed it's not exactly that way but but I think the brain has these sort of transmission systems and what you're describing with um people switching back and forth and checking email and phone Etc and back to the work um that should be at hand is sort of akin to going up and down the the gear system constantly yeah trying to arrive at a given destination and sure you might arrive but you're going to burn far more fuel it's the least efficient way to go about it you want to get into that deep Groove and I think when we hear about flow I feel like at least for me that's the sort of notion of flow that I'm looking for dropping into that deep Groove even if there's some friction within that groove of the the challenge of the work that I'm doing it's about not thinking about anything else it's really about Focus yep right and the word flow is just a wonderfully attractive word um that I think gives us the the false impression that we can just drop into things like a square wave function sit down pen and paper go and there's no possible way that neural circuits could work that way no we let's let's invent a term and I'm you tell me if the term makes sense I'm invent it's on the fly but uh neuros semantic coherence this is going to be my alternative term for flow when you're working on something hard um it's not that you're in an actual Flow State where you lose track of what you're doing you're concentrating really hard but I'm why I'm saying neuros semantic coherence is you get to this place where the sort of relevant semantic neural networks are all um those that are activated are all relevant to what you're doing and you've uh over time inhibited most of the unrelated networks that were fired up before and so you get in this sense of it's hard maybe I'm not losing track of time but like I'm all focused on this you know I'm grappling with the the the bear here the the math equation the the book chapter whatever it is um and so it's something different than flow but it's also different than Linda Stone had the term partial continuous attention which is what you're that cognitive disaster of I'm constantly Network switching back and forth so we'll call it neuros semantic coherence I'm got to coin that term um because it's uh you have this coherence of the semantic neural networks on what you're doing and that's the feeling of I'm getting after this hard problem and it might be really hard to do I mean I know the feeling of trying to solve a math proof for me for example could be so difficult because I mean what does it actually feel like in your head when you're solving a math proof it's a lot of you hold this here and then you try to get to the next step by doing this and it doesn't work but you have to keep holding this here which takes a lot of concentration okay let me try this that didn't work either but this looked promising okay so now I need to go back and in my mind's eye update this setup and now let me try this so it's a lot of holding things in your working memory um and keeping them loaded while you try an extension and then evaluating how that worked without and so it it requires um just internal concentration which isn't pleasant but in neuros semantic coherence it's all that's happening in your world you know is that in that proof so maybe that's what we should be pitching what people should be looking for is yeah forget flow but also remember like this default where you're like the rescue time data set participants checking email once every five minutes that's cognitive nonsense that's crazy that's like you're trying to you know play football and you're covering over one of your eyes and wearing like a 50 pound ruck sack on you're just like handicapping your abilities here for no reason right so what's in between is this idea and that requires Focus you know that requires deep work yeah we're playing football and then um every three Downs or so running into the stands and having a conversation trying to work out something challenging with your spouse or whatever then going back and try a totally different play set right um at risk of throwing too different too many analogies and and stories I'll just briefly say I went and saw the the play in New York with my sister this year I think it was Harry Potter and the cursed child or something like that um I didn't really enjoy the play that much but the set stuff was amazing and they have this magic Library I think is very very relevant here where essentially um the book that you open um has a certain topic I don't know maybe it's spells or something as Harry Potter again uh fun show but great set stuff didn't didn't really resonate with me too much in any event and then the books around it change their that but are related to that Central bookes and then if you look at one particular thing like maybe it's potions or something I'm making this up and then all of a sudden the books the books around it change they become either more specific there might be a distant but related idea that could lend itself to creativity so sort of that's the way the brain works in cognition is that we get into a frame of of a certain discussion or a certain theme and and the and the the books on the Shelf change according to their relatedness based on memory of past what's going on now and plans for the future I think anytime we look at uh we change context and we look at you know a raccoon video on Instagram or our calendar and oh there's that thing the books become very scattered so when we return to it there's a lot more friction uh a lot more work or neural neural energy required to get back into that um this uh narrow states of cognition just that exactly explains sort of my experience and the way I think about it yeah yeah because you're it takes time uh to to load up the these sort of relevant these secondary and tertiary semantic ideas and now they're there so like you can pull from them and then as you shift you have to sort of shift this whole thing around that takes a lot of concentration I mean I I wrote this this article once that got me a little bit of trouble not not trouble but mild trouble uh but it was it was called was for the Chronicle of Higher Education um and the title they gave it was is email making Professor stupid which wasn't my title you basically called every every one of your colleagues stupid we all check email the dean at the time did call me in for lunch but actually he was here's the thing he was like hey this is real I agree with this um but what I was arguing actually in that article essentially was what do we do at a university is is partially what we're supposed to be doing is trying to teach what the life of the mind is and how that works and we've kind of forgotten that so what we should maybe think about like at universities we need to be explicitly not just teaching how to think but also modeling the life of the mind at the at the highest level and so this idea that we just allow the the professor serot to to be drowned in um emails and and uh tasks and being as distracted you know it's the main war that every research Professor has is how do I how do I fight the admin overload until I become famous enough to get an assistant right like this is the big problem and I was making this proposal of University should be the citadels of concentration I said if you want to get the the best academics in the world to your University just tell them uh here's at the top of our contract you will not be assigned an email address like you're going to get Nobel laurates coming from you know all over the country to come to this place and so I was making this argument um we should think a more about thinking we should talk more about it we should model it exactly the type of things you're talking about but we don't it's much more contents focused but really this should be something more that we we get into specifically like this is how you actually use the mind to produce Innovative uh interesting high value new cognitive artifacts this is a very hard thing we're asking you to do um but you can Apprentice here because this is what we do and we've mastered we're going to teach you how to do it uh but we never have that sort of meta conversation sort of meta cognition conversation always thought that'd be important I think you'd have much better outcomes if that's part of what you learned at the University was how to take the thing in your head and really put it to work you know really extract out of it his capabilities or even high school or even Elementary School level I agree yeah U you have kids yeah and um"}

Embryo Storage & Donation; Donor Education & Consent", "segment_idx": "27", "time_start": "2:05:24", "time_end": "2:14:28", "context": "question right now they sit in storage this well this is a new problem okay IVF is only 40ish years old embryo freezing alone right the first IVF we haven't even gone through the whole process but the first IVF baby there's no FSH LH to stimulate more of the eggs outside the Vault to grow so they followed the single follicle and they didn't have the procedure which we do now which is a minimally invasive procedure to extract eggs we go vaginally with a needle attached to the ultrasound and we enter into each follicle and we drain it the very first IVF you followed one follicle and you went in abdominally with a surgery to get put that needle into the follicle and drain it out and give that just one egg a chance and then of course there was no embryo freezing originally so the field is still rather young to understand some of this and as technology rapidly improves we see things like better success rates with freezing and Tha embryos better process of getting more embryos to grow but now we have a lot of embryos in storage that may or may not be used I personally tell people you should keep your embryos you should pay the storage fee until no matter what the worst thing on planet Earth happens to you you're down having children because sadly I live in a spectrum with my field where I see a lot of sadness and people who maybe have lost a child something else is happened and they have maybe a sibling who they feel like they really want to give this sibling child the chance to be a sibling again and often you're much older when you're experiencing this and if you had had embryos Frozen that you could have used but you got rid of them you're going to be really upset if you find yourself in that circumstance so I always say you should save them until you know that you are not going to need them and then what do you do with them most people just discard them some people will donate them to last which is called for research but mostly it's for embryologist training to get better at doing which is also important okay um but embryo donation is a new thing so being able to just like we have people who donate sperm and donate eggs embryo donation is the next evolution of an opportunity to allow more people to become parents it's a little bit of the Wild West people finding people in Facebook groups and connecting it's this whole other Dynamic when it comes to what we call third party reproduction or you know what do you do with known donors and things like that but it's a very interesting concept so this problem is emerging as the technology is getting better I I'm realizing now um remembering rather that when I was in college and graduate school you would see these um ads in the student paper fre for egg donors and sperm donors um sperm regenerate throughout the lifespan so that's a kind of less controversial issue but this is now not allowed most places to advertise for for egg donors on college campuses that's my understanding um the egg donors were often paid whatever whatever they were paid I'm not going to say it was reasonable amounts or not because I don't I don't recall what they were paid everyone's circumstances are different but the argument that most people use against this is oh these these people are giving up eggs that they could otherwise use but we now know that's not true so um do you have any knowledge as to like what was the um the rationale for for kind of limiting the recruitment of egg donors um anyway I'm not arguing for or against I just I it's no longer supported based on what You' said by the um by the argument that they're losing eggs they would otherwise be able to some of it's about proper informed consent uh especially at an age where the financial incentive can be very persuasive without understanding that Mak sense not that it harms your fertility later but that you're going to have genetic children out there and you might potentially and we are seeing this now we don't know if you individually will have infertility for a variety of reasons because you're not trying to have a family until much later but the same concern doesn't seem to exist for men who are donating sperm like I mean it should there's this whole donor Community where people are really talking about putting new restrictions on will use sperm donation for example there are sperm donors who have hundreds of children hundreds right they are these sibling pods because it's been so unlimited and sperm banks are a business that work to make money and they make money by selling more sperm but that's not healthy one for a population you need genetic diversity but also it's not healthy necessarily for one person to have all these have siblings and to just not know when you're going to run into somebody who could potentially be your sibling is it this guy at the bar that you like do you have to worry about that if you're donor conceived so we're starting to see sperm banks finally start to reel back and put limitations on how many families total children's tough right because one family might have a child and you want them to be able to have sibling children but at least for how many families that that donor can contribute to and we're seeing sperm donors deal with the fact that now there's no Anonymous donation we can act like Anonymous donation exists meaning it is not identified at the time that somebody's utilizing the sperm but with you know direct to Consumer Testing for genetics like 23 and me and ancestry people are being connected with their sperm donors with their egg donors with their sibling pods and we have to believe that technolog is only going to improve over time so what people do for money especially when they're young I think without understanding the potential ramifications and I don't want to act like sperm donation or egg donation are bad they give people the opportunity to become parents that otherwise might not be able to and that is a lovely and a beautiful gift but you need to understand what that might mean and how that might impact your own potential children later too to know that they have genetic half siblin out there egg donation people do get compensated much better than sperm donation there are certain characteristics that are hard to find that get compensated even more so and certain you know ethnicities Doctorate Degrees and things like that where somebody can really pay for their education by donating their eggs it's a it's a dilemma because what you'd love to say is like free some eggs for you too if you're going to do that you're at the perfect age to freeze your own eggs and there's been strategies to try to mitigate this and I don't want to get off too much on a tangent but it's a really fine line that you walk with what people understand so there is a company and I won't name them but they are promoting that young women donate their eggs and they will freeze half of them for you and half of them will go and become donor eggs interesting business model but I could see the potential ethical concerns I think ethically this sounds good because you get to freeze some eggs but I think more people will donate eggs than otherwise would have for some of the reasons we previously stated and I also think you would get more money by simply donating your eggs and then turning around and paying for a round of freezing your own eggs you would get paid more and you'd have more eggs because one of the issues is do do you now falsely believe that you have enough eggs in the bank because you did this split but you don't really have enough because we already walked through the math at 20 eggs doesn't really result in such a high probability of having a multi-child family so you know there's a lot of ethical debate in gam and embryo donation it definitely is the wild west and there's a Uncharted Territory even an embryo donation there's places who are very unethical about it who will only allow people to have embryos if they are heterosexual been married for 3 years make a certain income submit to a home study yet they let the people have no say over the embryos that are transferred be it how many what stage what quality and they are taking people's money and putting terrible embryos inside of them and really wasting their resources which could have been used in another way yeah the dangers of propertization of biology right and Tech I mean Tech entering spaces is amazing but also technology start to advance before studies right Tech is going to become has more Finance backing than we see scientific studies get I feel like one of the major questions out there is whether or not"}

However, I think some people get a little bit overly concerned that if they didn't get their full night's sleep before some sort of physical event that their performance is going to plummet. Presumably, if you've already learned what you need to do, and it's stored in your neural circuits and you know how to make those coordinated movements, what the literature on slow wave sleep suggest is that you would be replenished. That the motor learning and the recovery from exercise is going to happen early in the night. Okay. So we'll just pause there, and kind of shelve that for a moment and then we're gonna come back to it. But I wanna talk about REM sleep, or rapid eye movement sleep. REM sleep and rapid eye movement sleep, as I mentioned before, occurs throughout the night, but you're gonna have more of it.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation also called TMS is achieving increasing popularity nowadays for the treatment of all sorts of neurologic conditions and psychiatric conditions. It is a non-invasive tool, it involves taking a coil it's a device with a coil that's placed over particular locations in the brain, and then sends magnetic stimulation into the brain and it can actually pass through the skull without having to drill through the skull and nowadays can be used to both lower the amount of activity or increase the amount of activity in specific brain areas. It's spatial, precision is not remarkable. That doesn't mean it's not of use, but it is not a super fine green tool, okay? It's not a canon, but it's also not a needle. It is somewhere in between. It can direct the activity of particular brain regions at particular depths and as I mentioned, it can increase or decrease that activity. So for instance, I've had a TMS coil placed on my head, not for therapeutic purposes, even it was, I wouldn't tell you, but rather just for, well, I'm a neuroscientist and I worked in a lab with one for entertainment, exploratory purposes, please don't do this at home. It was placed over my motor cortex, which generates voluntary action and it was a coil that at that time could only inhibit neurons and so what I was doing as I was moving objects around on a table, just like I am now, it was actually a pencil, not a pen and I was tapping the pencil and then the TMS coil was turned on and for the life of me, I could not move that pencil, okay? Because it was inhibiting my upper motor neurons in the portion of my cortex that controls voluntary activity. As soon as the coil was turned off, I could return to tapping the pencil again, nowadays it's possible to stimulate motor cortex or any area of the brain with some degree of precision that could create the impulse to move without actually making the decision to move. So you can literally engage certain neural circuits and therefore behaviors and certain thought and emotional patterns by way of transcranial magnetic stimulation. This has far reaching and vast implications, as you can probably imagine in discussing ADHD with a colleague that uses TMS, what they are doing is they are taking the TMS coil to children and adults that have ADHD, and they're using it to stimulate the portions of the prefrontal cortex that we talked about earlier that engage task directed focused states. So rather than using a drug that generally increases dopamine, and some of the other chemicals involved there you using directed TMS stimulation of the circuits and fortunately, I was quite relieved to hear this, they are combining that with a focused learning task. So they're literally teaching the brain to learn in a noninvasive way, no drug at all and right now there are experiments clinical trials going on, comparing TMS of this sort to the drug treatments of the sort that we described earlier that engaged these circuits through pharmacologic mechanisms. So very exciting times for TMS, very exciting times for pharmacology related to ADHD and for enhancing focus in general and when I say very exciting times, I mean, no drug is perfect, but the constellation of drugs that's out there is getting much larger, but because they tap into different aspects of their circuitry, I do think that we are well on our way to identifying the ideal combinations of drug treatments, technological treatments, and behavioral paradigms for increasing focus in both children and adults with ADHD. And as a final final point,"}

I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, we are discussing psilocybin. Psilocybin is a psychedelic, meaning it modifies the psyche. And in doing so, it changes our level of consciousness. Psychedelics, such as psilocybin changed the way that we perceive the outside world and our internal world, our memories, our thoughts, our feelings, et cetera. Not just while one is under the influence of psilocybin, but it can also fundamentally change all of those things afterwards and for a very long period of time afterwards as well, which is one of the reasons why there's growing excitement about the application of psilocybin and other psychedelics for the treatment of various mental health issues, such as depression, alcohol abuse disorder, and addictions of various kinds, as well as things like OCD and eating disorders. Today, we will discuss psilocybin, talking about what it is. In fact, you may be surprised to learn that psilocybin basically is serotonin. Now, for those of you that are familiar with psilocybin and serotonin, you might think, wait, that's not true. But, in fact, psilocybin main effect is to mimic serotonin. But it does it in a very specific way because it activates a subset of serotonin receptors in a very strong fashion leading to neuroplasticity at the level of the neural circuits, that is the brain areas and the connections that serve things like memory and perception. So if any of that is confusing at this point, I promise to make it all clear in just a few minutes. Psilocybin is one of many psychedelics, of course. There are things like LSD, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT. Even MDMA while not considered a classic psychedelic is considered a psychedelic in the general sense. Today's episode is going to focus on psilocybin in particular. I will tell you what psilocybin is, how it works at the molecular and cellular level. I'll talk about how it changes brain circuitry. I'll talk about the clinical effects what's been demonstrated in controlled laboratory studies. I'll talk about dosages and translating from psilocybin mushrooms to actual psilocybin, and the compound that actually exerts the effects of psilocybin which it turns out is not psilocybin, but something called psilocin. Psilocin is the actual compound that goes into the brain to create all the changes in consciousness and all the rewiring effects that we associate with psilocybin. So understanding how psilocybin is converted to psilocin has tremendous impact on the duration of a psilocybin journey, whether or not that psilocybin journey is going to lead to a short or longer window for neuroplasticity. In fact, many people don't realize this. But much of the positive changes that are possible with proper-- and I do want to underscore proper psilocybin therapeutic approaches, takes place after the session in which one feels all typical or typically associated effects of psilocybin like hallucinations and changes in thought patterns, et cetera. So today, we are going to talk a little bit about chemistry. But I promise to make it accessible to anyone and everyone, regardless of whether or not you have a background in chemistry or biology. We're going to talk about some cell biology, the actual neuronal changes that occur when one takes psilocybin. And we're going to talk about how neural circuits change over time and how all of that impacts the changes that most people are interested in when they go on a psilocybin journey. Things such as long standing improvements in mood, things such as tremendous insight into themselves and to others, into their past, their present, and their future, and even changes in their levels of creativity, or their ability to experience joy from music or their ability to dissociate in a positive way from things that formerly were depressing or triggers for depression. In fact, we're going to talk quite a lot about the conditions inside of a psilocybin journey that make it actually positive and therapeutic. This is a very important point that I'll make several times throughout today's episode, which is that just because something invokes neuroplasticity changes in brain circuitry does not mean that it's therapeutic, or I should say, does not necessarily mean that it's therapeutic. For neuroplasticity to be therapeutic, it has to be adaptive, it has to allow someone to function better in life than they did previously. So today, we will talk about how the conditions of a psilocybin journey, including whether or not it's done with eyes closed or eyes open, or whether or not people alternate between eyes closed and eyes open phases of that journey, as well as whether or not music is played during that journey, and even what types of music are played will dictate whether or not somebody will feel better or worse in the days and weeks and years following that psilocybin journey, as well as the dosage level. Because as you'll soon learn as well, there are clinical studies showing that just one psilocybin journey can improve mood in a long-standing way. But most clinical trials involve two dosages spaced in very precise ways from one another with appropriate follow up. But in both of those particular journeys, the structure of the journey who's present, who's not present, eyes open or eyes closed, the particular music that's played. All of those features make up part of a larger neuroplasticity trigger of which psilocybin is critical. But psilocybin is not the only variable. So whether or not you're interested in participating in a clinical study, or whether or not you're interested in psilocybin for other reasons, this is critical information to understand. So today, we're going to talk about nearly every feature of psilocybin possible, including what psilocybin is, how it works at the level of chemistry cell biology, and neural networks, and neuroplasticity. We'll talk about the clinical studies. We'll talk about dosages. We will talk about conditions of clinical studies, and we will talk about the post psilocybin journey period in which neuroplasticity and the various activities, including therapy or perhaps not therapy can contribute to positive therapeutic changes from psilocybin. Now, as we go into this discussion, I do want to underscore the fact that at the time of recording this episode, meaning now, May 2023, psilocybin is still a Schedule I drug. It is considered illegal in the United States. There's perhaps just one exception to that, maybe a few others. But the main exception is in the state of Oregon, psilocybin has been approved in particular therapeutic settings for use in particular conditions namely depression and some forms of addiction. So in Oregon, it's more or less in the domain of a decriminalized as opposed to actually legal. In other areas of the country, including Oakland, California, there are some areas in which it has been decriminalized. And perhaps there are a few others that I'm not aware of. But, in general, psilocybin and other psychedelics are still considered illegal. And this is very important. Not just saying this to protect me, I'm saying this to protect you. Possessing or certainly selling psilocybin, except for rare instances, such as clinical studies and these decriminalized areas that I talked about a moment ago is still very much not allowed under the law. Today, I'll also discuss safety issues. I'll talk about whether or not young people, meaning people 25 or younger should consider psilocybin given that their brain is still in a rampant period of naturally occurring neuroplasticity. I will also talk about dosages as it relates to people who have formerly been on or may currently be on different forms of antidepressants. And I will talk about people who are at risk for psychotic episodes either because they know they themselves have a propensity for psychosis or they have close family members who have psychosis, which includes things like schizophrenia, bipolar depression, as well as things like borderline personality, and some related psychiatric conditions. So today's episode really will be a deep dive into psilocybin. So whether or not you think you're already familiar with psilocybin and its effects, or whether or not you're just curious about them, I do encourage if you're willing to try and ratchet through some of the understanding of how psilocybin works and what it is, leading up to some of the therapeutic applications and different patterns of dosing spacing of different sessions, et cetera. Because I do believe that with that knowledge in hand, you will be able to make far better, much more informed decisions about whether or not psilocybin is right for you."}

anything I think Paul kti made that very clear to us in the mental health series these are names by necessity but it's a framework that certainly taught me something absolutely and and and certainly those who haven't been in the military maybe had a seed event of something challenging or whatever it is you know um many people uh struggle with with these kinds of things that live inside them um in the nervous system they pack it down maybe they don't but um that was inside you at that point M I think you and I first got acquainted in somewhere around 2016 when you and some other folks from tier one community and related communities started coming to lab and my lab and I never really talked publicly about my lab has been involved with various things in Canada and the US um not trying to create any Mystique there but it's it's not not a point of Interest what we did and and um but I recall at that time just thinking like this guy's just an amazing team guy but in any event um you know we got to know each other a bit and my since then was like it's like a that's kind of indestructible right you know and now I realize nobody's indestructible we're flesh and Bone but um but if we may let let's let's fast forward a bit um to uh a couple years later um if you're willing to talk about it um maybe talk about some of the uh the evolution that happened so you started working a job MH um you're getting back into civilian life yep and um I recall a conversation about this time of year probably about three year three years ago yeah and you had done what um a lot of uh vets from um tier one operations have done and are now doing which I actually have um mostly uh favorable outlook on which is um there now these are uh I want to be very clear legal and sanctioned explorations of the Psychedelic space right and I remember you called me and you described uh the experience that you had uh had um and some of the connection with Warrior culture that that had helped emerge for you so you could you explain what happened there you know probably the entry Andrew is as important you know meaning it's not all about books but this is actually another thing I've really learned you know I was very intellect and achievement Central and as you can see how easy the emotion comes out now I kind of very frighteningly understand people who like feel stuff a lot more it's a whole other landscape it's miserable well wait yeah it is yet it's I I agree I it's a very uncomfortable space uh you know but we'll get we'll get there it's it's a journey for me let me put it that way so you know there's a bunch of other I'm a vicious reader and I really enjoy it and you know my entree and little window into the world of getting that kind of help came from a lot of different areas um I found in our area a cranos cyal therapist who it still seems like because I mentioned it to people and it sounds Fringe to them it's a very light touch not even Chiropractic like and it's closer to myof fasal type of massage some some tapping very like Ta on the top of the head the part I actually love the most is the back of the neck sort of manipulation is you're lying down relaxed yeah you're clothed super easy in terms of that um couple years of that just because of Athletics I love massage and that's kind of my entree and um so through the body sematics yeah which frankly in many ways is my favorite back to the physical orientation to the world is is what I is what's useful to me um but also I I mean I read Sam Harris's first book end of faith in 2006 and so I've followed him for 15 years religiously read all of his books um lying moral landscape and his I I don't know him personally so public stuff notwithstanding that's not important to me but waking up and I took um I took an online course with Robert Wright who who wrote why Buddhism is true but that's really not what he's known for you know Princeton Professor um he's so funny he's very humorous and I started to work my way into I don't I don't have some like I don't want people think have some like whizbang like spiritual practice that's whatever you know I but it it became very interesting to me Andrew this this I I needed to find I started to realize I needed to find a way to back away from the 24-hour ledge like that Super Hyper Focus I needed to get a little bit of perspective one of my favorite short videos is Richard Fan's pale blue dot I needed to just back away you know that reminds me thank you so much for talking about time space bridging I think the other day yeah we make we I'll cue people to that clip in the caption it's a way of taking oneself out of one's immediate sphere of vision and looking literally looking further out into one's environment and then back again as a perceptual exercise of understanding that as our visual field expands our perception of time also expands um the binning the chunking of time yeah that and my and your conversation years ago about um Horizon and activating the parasympathetic system instead of sympathetic I I just very slowly started to realize I needed to back away from the small picture and the reading and the cranial sacr and massage and I was still not really getting consistent real help but I thought I could do it through educating myself intellectually and um I thought it was time to and it was it has short-term consequences but longterm it's been amazing to you know deal with the plant medicines in a in a controlled and Cur ated environment and that experience was super safe and quite amazing actually the weekend or the three or four days was super intense but I didn't leave there thinking again I kind of thought I'm good that was great yeah uh couple things um one we've covered psychedelics on this podcast"}

generally not in the middle of the night if I can avoid it uh and I generally avoid it but I'm trying to take what we've discuss this far and superimpose the the notion of smartphones and ask what are the rules what are the algorithms that we're learning when we use these devices and I'm not calling them adaptive or maladaptive they're clearly here to stay they've assisted in medicine I'm sure it makes it easier for doctors to communicate on the on the ward and and for um clinic and it's so useful right but contained in this small device um there are things like uh for instance text messaging where unlike 20 years ago we can have four or five different conversations very quickly while boarding a flight um there's a task switching element that was just not present in our life um prior to that um social media in particular this notion of being able to scroll so move if we really step back from this move one's thumb and access hundreds if not thousands of video content from dist which Each of which has a distinct context um and so I have to imagine that kids and adults have frontal cortices that are learning these rules and the rule is move your thumbs stay engaged emotions either positive veilance emotions or negative emotions I mean it's it's a fairly limited um landscape there when you really think about it but but the algorithm that's learned is to me doesn't seem exportable it doesn't help me prepare for a podcast at all I know that for sure doesn't help me go for a run doesn't help me listen with more focused attention to a family member or a friend or a significant other um it may make me more empathic or more angry I you know we can we can speculate but um again with no with no intention of demonizing social media does it seem that the the algorithms that are being run in our brain I mean are they neutral are they positive are they negative should we be worried um it doesn't seem like they translate to much else they they W I can't see a way in which they help us be better people in other domains whereas reading a book line by line and then going back oh I didn't even remember anything from that page going back line by line um playing a game of squash or something like that there I can see the real value of the rule sets that generalize yeah I mean I can you know just historically I grew up in a world when there was no smartphones as a resident and and so one of the most difficult things I do in practice is have to take care of patients in the emergency room and there's a real emergency someone's having gun control seizures or they're having a stroke and you know doing this back in the 80s or 90s and early 2000s when you went down there and you didn't have any smartphone you you could only rely on what's what's in your head and I could say now having the smartphone it hasn't it doesn't help me at all I I never you know it does not help me at all in making the kind of decisions that I have to make in the emergency room I'm I'm trying to decide you know what what what's the problem here what's the differential diagnosis what how should I treat it I'm just trying to make very going through an algorithm like you said in a common sense way and there's nothing on my phone that I can turn to to help me do that it has helped with giving me knowledge like back in the day I had to remember what the Dilantin dose was and have that in my head or go look for the piece of paper in my pocket and so I can quickly pull up you know I guess I'm a little bit you know there's information that I can access that I don't have to worry about keeping every single dose in my head or keeping everything in my head just facts in my head but uh outside of that there's nothing I can turn to that it's it's making me you know better making me make better decision so I I don't even need my cell phone I don't go searching my for my cell phone if I'm going to go to mer room or going to take a take a phone call so I don't see how it's helping sort of make your frontal Lo it can't be your frontal loes I mean it's another way of saying it but but on the flip side can it help you optimize frontal low function technology certainly it can we can maybe talk about it later there there certainly that's one way to get learn strategies is through a through a device that that's easily accessible and uh you know to you as opposed to a book or or having a therapist uh in your house yeah I suppose I worry that um too much of my time and other people's time and especially young people's time is um engaging in a algorithm that does not um generalize for adaptive Behavior elsewhere and and by comparison you know like a a game of soccer with friends or something right it's social social media is social um it's physical social media is not physical but we'll we'll rule that that portion out but there's a rule set um there's gold directed behavior um presumably some of the things that happen in a game of soccer with friends translate to some other domain of life um because it's a single context game of soccer whereas with social media I don't know anybody that goes and looks at One account and that's it and absorbs the information maybe comments has an interaction and goes it's it's hundreds or thousands of contacts so is there any risk or perhaps benefit to being able to um get this very detailed portal into so many contexts per unit time I mean the the forebrains never had done that in the course of human history as far as I know yeah I mean I think there is a risk but what Pops to mind you know having kids is is watching them navigate in their cars to places totally dependent on on Google Maps um I I think you're probably old enough to remember real Maps where you didn't I still have one in my I still I love paper maps I love Maps right where you had to really figure out you know you you had to go to a certain place and you had to either look at the map or or or ask stop at a gas station and ask these these these skills were something that you learned and you developed and it was problem solving and and uh and that's all gone now I mean it's it's I I wonder even if sometimes if if uh people even know the direction they're going whether it's West North or what set they're in because they're just following the directions so I we we'll see I I just can't imagine that that learned skill is not going to be detrimental to us at at some point and generalize in the generalize in a bad way right as as opposed to a good way um so I don't I yeah it does it does definitely worry me but like you said there's nothing on the phone that helps you plan a podcast nothing that helps me in the emergency room nothing helps a professor when he's giving a lecture so I agree with you that that the sort of having your head buried in in a cell phone I'm not yeah it's I don't see it being healthy for your frontal loves let's talk about working memory um some years back but still

{"question": "Can I train my sense of smell and taste to become more sensitive and discerning, and if so, how can I do it?", "doc_id": "Mwz8JprPeMc_12", "video_id": "Mwz8JprPeMc", "video_title": "How Smell, Taste & Pheromone-Like Chemicals Control You", "video_header": "How You Can Become A Human Scent Hound, Detecting Cancer, & Tasting Better", "segment_idx": "12", "time_start": "38:30", "time_end": "43:40", "context": "When Noam Sobel's group was at Berkeley I happened to be a graduate student around that time, and every once in a while I'd look outside and there would be people crawling around on the grass with goggles on, gloves on, and these hoods on with earmuffs. And they looked ridiculous, but what they were doing is they were actually learning to follow scent trails. So, in the world of dogs you have sight hounds that use their eyes in order to navigate and find things, and you have scent towns that use their nose. And the scent hounds are remarkable, they can be trained to detect a scent. These are the sniffing, you know, the bomb sniffing and the drug sniffing dogs in airports. There are now dogs actually that can sniff out COVID infections with a very high degree of accuracy, they can be trained to do that. There's something about the COVID and similar infections that the body produces probably in the immune response, some odors and the dogs are I think as high as 90% in some cases, maybe even 95% accuracy, just remarkable. There are theories that dogs can sniff out cancer, this stuff all exceeds statistical significance. It's still a little bit mysterious in some ways, but you may not ever achieve the olfactory capabilities of a scent hound, but what Noam Sobel's lab did is they had people completely eliminate their visual experience by having them wear dark glasses or goggles, so they couldn't see, and they couldn't hear, they couldn't sense anything with their sense of touch, they had thick gloves on. But they had these masks on where just their nasal passages were open and people could in a fairly short amount of time learn to follow a chocolate scent trail on the ground, which is not something that most people want to do, but what they showed using brain imaging, et cetera in subsequent studies is that the human brain, you can learn to really enhance your sense of smell and become very astute in distinguishing whether or not one particular odor or combinations of odors is such that it's less than, or more than a different odor for instance. Now, why would you want to do this? Well, if you like to eat as much as I do, one of the things that can really enhance your sense of pleasure from the experience of ingesting food is to enhance your sense of smell. And if you don't have a great sense of smell, or if you have a sense of smell that's really so good that it's always picking up bad odors, we'll talk about that in a minute. Well, then you might want to tune up your sense of smell by doing this practice of 10 or 15 breaths, excuse me, sniffs, not breaths, sniffs and then interacting with some food item or thing that you're interested in smelling more of. So, these could be the ingredients that you're cooking with, I really encourage you to try and really smell them. You sometimes hear this as kind of a mindfulness practice like ooh, really smell the food, really taste the food. And we always hear about that as kind of a mindfulness and presence thing, but you actually can increase the sensitivity of your olfactory and your taste system by doing this. And it has long-term effects, that's what's so interesting. This isn't the kind of thing that you have to do every time you eat. You don't have to be the weirdo in the restaurant that's like picking up the radish and like jamming it up your nostrils, please don't do that. You don't have to necessarily smell everything, although it's nice sometimes to smell the food that you're about to eat and as you eat it, but it has long-term effects in terms of your ability to distinguish and discriminate different types of odors. And these don't even have to be very pungent foods it turns out, the studies show that doesn't have to be some really stinky cheese, you know, there are cheese shops that I've walked into where like I just basically gag, I can't handle it, I just can't be in there, it just overwhelms me. Other people, they love that smell. So, you have to tune it to your interest and experience, but I think even for you fasters out there, everybody eats at some point, everybody ingests chemicals through their mouth. And one of the ways that you can powerfully increase your relationship to that experience and make it much more positive is through just the occasional practice of 10 or 15 sniffs of nothing, which almost sounds ridiculous like how could that be? But now, you understand why, it's because of the way that the sniffing action increases the alertness of the brain as well as increasing the sensitivity of the system. No other system that I'm aware of in our body is as amenable to these kinds of behavioral training shifts and allow them to happen so quickly. I would love to be able to tell you that just doing 10 or 15 near-far exercises with a pen or going outside for 10 or 15 seconds each morning is going to completely change the way that you see the world. But it actually isn't the case, you actually, it requires more training, a little bit more effort in the visual system. In the olfactory system, and your smell system, and in your taste system just the tiniest bit of training and attention, and sniffing, inhaling can radically change your relationship to food such that you actually start to feel very different as a consequence of ingesting those foods as well as becoming more discerning about which foods you like and which ones you don't like. And we're going to talk about that because there's a really wonderful thing that happens when you start developing a sensitive palate and a sensitive sense of smell in a way that allows you to guide your eating"}

{"question": "What is the optimal angle and intensity of contraction for performing soleus pushups to achieve the benefits observed in the study on glucose utilization and metabolism?", "doc_id": "q1Ss8sTbFBY_2", "video_id": "q1Ss8sTbFBY", "video_title": "Fitness Toolkit: Protocol & Tools to Optimize Physical Health | Huberman Lab Podcast #94", "video_header": "Tool: Soleus (Calf) Push-Ups, Glucose Utilization & Metabolism", "segment_idx": "2", "time_start": "4:35", "time_end": "14:37", "context": "Before we dive into today's content about fitness and fitness protocols, I want to tell you about a brand new study that is very exciting and frankly very unusual. This is a study that was published out of the University of Houston, examining what I would call a micro exercise or a micro movement. It's a very small movement of a very small portion of your body, in fact, just 1% of your musculature, that when it's performed continuously while seated has, at least what they report, are very dramatic positive changes in terms of blood sugar utilization and metabolism. So the title of this study is \"A potent physiological method to magnify and sustain soleus oxidative metabolism improves glucose and lipid regulation.\" This study was published in iScience, and as I mentioned earlier, it is getting a lot of attention and it's very unusual. Without going into all the details of this study, let me just briefly give you a little bit of the background. First of all, you have a muscle called the soleus. The soleus muscle is a more or less wide flat muscle that sits beneath what most people think of as their calf, although it's part of the calf muscle. The other portion of the calf is called the gastrocnemius. The soleus sits below that. Now, the soleus muscle is a unique muscle because it's largely slow twitch muscle fibers. It's designed to be used continuously over and over again for stabilizing your body when you're standing upright, for walking. This is a muscle that's designed to contract over and over and over again. In fact, you could walk all day on this muscle and most likely it would not get sore. You probably done that and it did not get sore. In contrast, a muscle like your bicep or your tricep, if I were to have you perform hundreds or thousands of repetitions, even with a very lightweight one pound weight or a two pound weight, eventually it would fatigue. You would feel a sort of a burn there. It's a very unusual set of muscles to use repeatedly. But the soleus is an unusual muscle in that it really is designed to be used continuously. Now, this study was focused on how people who sit a lot of the day and don't have the opportunity for a lot of physical movement or maybe who don't even exercise at all can improve their metabolism and glucose utilization. Without going into a deep dive about glucose utilization, because we've done the deep dive on this podcast, episodes such as metabolism, et cetera, you can look those up at hubermanlab.com. They're all timestamped and available there. Anytime you eat, your blood sugar goes up to some extent. So your blood glucose, as it's called, goes up to some extent. And then insulin is a hormone that's used to essentially chaperone and sequester and use that blood glucose or it's basically the idea is you don't want blood glucose to go too high. Hyperinsulinemia is something associated with blood glucose that's too high because insulin goes up to essentially match the level of blood glucose. You don't also don't want to be hypoglycemic, you don't want to have blood sugar that's too low, and insulin is involved in both regulating peaks and troughs in blood sugar, blood glucose. So we can basically say, and this is very simple, but we can basically say that you don't want blood glucose to be elevated too much or for too long. That's not good. In fact, people who have diabetes because they don't make insulin, people who have type 1 diabetes do not make insulin at all, their blood glucose is so high that they actually have to take insulin in order to regulate otherwise their blood glucose can go so high that it can damage cells and damage organs. It can even kill people. People who have type 2 diabetes are so called insulin insensitive. They make insulin, but the receptors to insulin are not sensitive to it, and so they make more insulin than normally would be made and blood glucose isn't regulated properly, et cetera, et cetera. The take home message about blood glucose is that you want your blood glucose levels to go up when you eat, but not too high and you don't want them to stay elevated for too long. This study looked at how people who are largely sedentary or at least sitting can increase the utilization, the clearance of glucose from the bloodstream after eating, and they also looked at overall metabolism. For people, get this, that were using just that 1% of muscle, the soleus, by doing what they call a soleus pushup. So the soleus pushup can be described very simply as if you're sitting down with your knee bent at approximately right angle, like a square corner, and pushing up, or I should say lifting your heel while pushing down on your toe and contracting the calf muscle as it were, and then lowering the heel and then in lifting that heel again, lowering the heel, lifting the heel again, each one of those is what they call a soleus pushup. This study had people continuously do soleus pushups and they looked at things like blood glucose utilization, they looked at metabolism and so on. Now, a couple of important things about this study before I tell you what they discovered, which was frankly pretty miraculous, almost hard to believe, and yet I believe the data looked to be collected quite well, and there are a lot of statistics and the study looks to be quite thorough. First of all, they used an equal number of male and female subjects. There were a wide range of body mass indices, okay? So this wasn't just super fit people or people that were purely sedentary and not fit. They used a wide variety of ages, time of day, people who tended to walk a lot or not walk a lot. They measured changes in metabolism and blood glucose utilization and people that had done these soleus pushups while seated in the laboratory, and I must say, they had them do these soleus pushups for quite a long while, continuously. So they had them do it for as long as 270 minutes total throughout the day. So if you divide that, that's four and a half hours, you might say, well, four and a half hours of lifting the heel and putting the heel down, lifting the heel, putting the heel down, that's a lot. But they didn't always do it continuously. They had some breaks in there. So this is the sort of thing that you could imagine you or other people could do while seated, while doing Zooms or while on calls or maybe even while eating, doing that sort of thing. Although I'm not suggesting that you constantly be focusing on soleus pushups throughout your life. The point is that people who did these soleus pushups experienced dramatic improvements in blood sugar regulation and in metabolism despite the fact that the soleus is just 1% of the total musculature. So here I'm going to read from the abstract about what they found, people who did these soleus pushups, despite being a tiny muscle and using very little local energy... In fact, they measured muscle glycogen, the burn or essentially the utilization of fuel within the muscle, and there was very little utilization of fuel within the soleus itself, and that's because the soleus has this unique property of needing to basically keep you going all day, walking all day or moving all day. What they saw was a large magnitude, for example, 52% less postprandial, that's after a meal, glucose excursion, So 52% less increase in blood glucose and 60%, six zero less hyper insulinemia, so reduced levels of insulin. They also, miraculously, observed that despite this being, again, a small muscle, 1% of the total muscle mass, so very small oxidative use, they saw big improvements in systemic metabolic regulation. So this is interesting and I think something that we should at least know about. I'm not aware that anyone's replicated this study yet. I know there's a ton of excitement about this study in the popular press, and if the data turn out to hold up, which I like to imagine they will, I can understand why there's so much excitement. What this means is that if you're somebody who cares about blood glucose regulation, you want to keep your metabolism running, please don't stop exercising, the other ways that you exercise. But if you're somebody who wants to maximize your health, doing these soleus pushups fairly continuously while seated is going to be beneficial. And in addition to that, I know that there are going to be people out there who, for instance, might be injured or you're traveling and you're stuck on a plane or you're in the classroom and you're forced to study all day or take notes all day. You're just not getting enough opportunity to get those steps that you want to take, whether or that's 10,000 or fewer or more, getting enough steps or movement. Maybe you don't have time to get out and do your run, or maybe you're also running, weightlifting and doing yoga classes and things of that sort, but you want to further improve your fitness, at least in terms of your metabolic health. This seems like a terrific, very low investment way to do it. Certainly zero cost. It does take a little bit of attention, so you have to divert your attention from other things you're doing to make sure that you're still doing these soleus pushups. I'm sure that many of you are going to have a lot of detailed questions such as how high did they lift the heel and did they contract the muscle very hard or not? Couple of things about that, they did not have subjects really contract the muscle hard. They did measure the angle of heel raise and it was anywhere from 10 to 15 degrees so they didn't have to go way, way up on their tippy toes or things of that sort. In any event, 270 minutes, four and a half hours of doing these soleus pushups is a lot, but by my read of the data and the rather significant, or I should say very significant effects that they observed on blood glucose regulation and metabolism, et cetera, seems to me that doing less would still be beneficial and that you don't necessarily have to do the full 270 minutes in order to get the benefits that they observed. More about the study includes the fact that the benefits they observed were very long lasting, as long as two hours after a meal, they could still see this improved blood glucose utilization. I don't know because I wasn't able to find it in the methods whether or not they were doing the soleus pushups while they were consuming blood sugar in this study. The point being that if you're somebody who cares about their fitness, this study is interesting, because what it means is that, again, if you are forced to be immobile or sitting longer than you would like, if you're stuck in a meeting or Zooms or class or on a plane, et cetera, or if you're simply trying to add a bit more fitness and metabolic health to your overall regimen, soleus pushups, at least to me, seem like a very low investment, simple, zero cost tool to improve your metabolic health.

Specificity vs. Variation, Prilepin's Chart", "segment_idx": "18", "time_start": "1:53:23", "time_end": "2:02:33", "context": "so happy to have you here having this discussion is we can really get into the weeds but also hit a number of questions that I hear a lot Y how does one contend with the first attempt at a lift not working out it too heavy something goes wrong hopefully not injury promoting wrong but something goes wrong do you count that do you reset the workout and then the counterpart to that question is what do you do if it's too easy when wrong wrong because you didn't put enough weight on the bar didn't pick up a heavy enough set of dumbbells do you abandon the set and and replace it with another and I guess this is really a question of how much margin for error is there in volume yep when doing this 3x5 program sure uh two things that I'd like to start with number one is I talked about linear periodization and undulating periodization there's actually a new model newish model called Auto regulation which basically says you're going to go in today and depending on any number of biomarkers performance markers or your performance you will adjust your training based on how you're feeling that day and so 70% is that maybe for example not necessarily 70% of your one repetition Max highest ever is 70% of what you can actually do that day and so it actually allows you to Auto regulate your training based on actually what's happening and so you don't have to have as much long-term planning in your program design um because it'll sort of figure itself out as you're going you can use velocity to determine this Auto regulation you can use actually it's like taking it up to close to a Max for the day and then basing all your percentages on that daily Max or a lot of different ways so that is actually one very effective strategy and there's a lot of research coming out on auto regulation there's a lot of different ways to do it so that's one thing to say another thing to say is this three to five okay um it depends on if we're going for speed power or strength because while all those other variables are the same for three to five the core difference between whether that is a power workout or a strength workout is the load right so if you are at a moderate load say 30% of your one repetition Max up to about 70% that's going to be a power-based adaptation assuming you're going with high intent can you sorry I I have to interrupt maybe just clarify what intent is yeah you're attempting to move the implement or go through the movement pattern as fast as you can great thank you if you're trying to go for strength and you're below 70% you're not really going to be improving strength because the total mass is not heavy enough and so really when we say strength we're assuming you're at at least generally 70% or higher now if you're new to training totally different thing right but if you're moderately trained to highly trained you're going to be well north of 70% so anything below that we don't really count anyways um that's those are warm-up sets basically all right so one thing to actually give you some very specific numbers here and I don't have all of these memorized we can perhaps um provide a chart later or send out something to them but there's a chart that you can look up called a pilipin chart how do you spell that uh p r i l i p i nin pipin and there's actually been a a few studies on it it's it's a it's it's been old it's been around for a very long time it's sort of in the coaching realm and then a handful of studies out of New Zealand came out verifying and validating a lot of it but what it effectively does is say if strength is the goal and this comes from the powerlifting weightlifting sort of communities optimizing for strength then how much time do I need to spend at each intensity range so 70% 80% 90% Etc because specificity is going to say this if you want to get better neuromuscular guy at shooting a basketball the most important thing you could ever do is shoot a basketball under the exact circumstances that you're going to do it right specificity always wins if you want to get better at strength the most important thing you need to do is that exact movement at that load and in this case if you wanted to get better at you know bench press lifting at 100% of your max on a bench press is the most specific thing you could ever do the more you can do that the faster you will increase your bench press Max however that's very hard to do without getting hurt it's also not addressing what I call your Defender so if the reason you can't bench press higher than whatever you're benching now it may not be your pure strength it may be any number of things like you don't have enough muscle or technique or these things okay great so specificity over here um variation on the other side and so we're playing this game we've talked about of of how do I make sure that I can have enough specificity in my training without leading to uh overuse injury all how do I maximize or how do I reduce my chance of injury while getting enough speci specificity and so we have a classic Paradigm over here one actually training protocol you can look up is called the Bulgarian method and the bulgarians were un amazing um at the sport of Olympic weightlifting um probably in fact the the uh the the patriarch of this entire thing recently passed away Ian IV uh neams L monog Glo pocket Hercules one of the greatest weightlifters of all time came out of the system and they do a lot of things but one example in the Bulgarian system is you're going to do a one repetition maximum snatch you're going to take a little bit of a break you'll do a one repetition maximum cleaning jerk take a little bit of a break do a one repetition maximum front squat take a little bit of a break and you're going to repeat that two to three times a day every day that's specificity right those people get extraordinarily strong now they don't do that all year round they don't do that with all their lifters but this is when we're trying to Peak for a major competition like the Olympics we are going so far into specificity and that was very counter to the Russian system with a which is much more of our classic periodization sort of approach okay specificity is is tremendous but in doing that the bulgarians just brutalize a lot of athletes right because it's very difficult to handle something like that and you can't really do that that long without getting wrecked and there the goal is to win medals the goal is it's a totally different thing than longevity out of here right like we're trying to push the boundaries of or aesthetic changes unless someone has a naturally balanced Physique in general if people do one sort of movement I find that they tend to resemble the equipment that they did that movement with over time right that was a joke against kettle bells of course of course of course I got it so we know specificity is technically optimal but it's not realistic not for that kind of a you know extreme situation so how do we balance these things well it turns out this pilipin chart gives you guidelines for how much time and by time I mean how many repetitions to stand um in each of these rep ranges so that you get kind of the best of this world you're going to find the same thing by way when we get into endurance training there's only so much training you can do at 95% of your heart rate before it starts becoming like quite detrimental you need to actually spend a lot of time at those lower intensities so the prant chart walks you through how many sets and it gives you a range like like the I think that the bottom of it is like um how much time do you spend at like 60 to 70% every one at Max and it says like you know a minimum of this set to a maximum of this set but the ideal number of reps per set per week is like 18 and then it walks you through and so there's there's four CR IIA on it um I think it's 55 to 65% again how many reps there it's like 3 to six reps per set um 18 to 30 reps total and I think the ideal rep range is like 24 something like that so it g takes you have 55 to 65 70 to 80 80 to 90 and the 90 plus percent what you'll see is the 90 plus perc number is more like 1 to two reps per set for a total of about seven total repetitions if you start cruising past that um other bad things start to creep up in there so that's a really effective chart what it really highlights though is even somebody who's trying to maximize strength you're going to spend something like 35 or so perc of your training time between this like 55 to 65% range so you're asking early like well do I even count that one the the answer is yeah you know in that range if it's below 55 60% you probably don't count it now again some coaches don't count it unless it's even above 70 fine it's not a major distinction but you're going to spend the bulk of your time you know accumulating some some technique basically and skill and tissue tolerance very important um The Next Step Up is like 28% I think is is sort of the cut off of how much time you spend um between 70 and 80% of re one or Max and then it jumps down to like 23% and then all the way to to 70% so you can walk yourself through that and that gives you an extremely good guideline and you'll notice all of these are still in three range it's just really you're manipulating it by total sets or total exercises so that can give you some structure to play with we will provide a link to the pipin Chart yeah in the show note captions training to failure when the goal is strength yeah should one do it"}

Some estimate of like 37 trillion cells, different cells in your body. And what are they all doing? And what do they look like when you're healthy? What do they look like when you're sick? And where we're at right now with our understanding of cells and what happens when you get sick is basically we've gotten pretty good at, from the Human Genome Project, looking at how different mutations in your genetic code lead for you to be more susceptible to get sick or directly cause you to get sick. So we go from a mutation in your DNA to, wow, you now have Huntington's disease, for instance. And there's a lot that happens in the middle. And that's one of the questions that we're going after at CZI, is what actually happens. So an analogy that I like to use to share with my friends is, right now, say we have a recipe for a cake. We know there's a typo in the recipe. And then the cake is awful. That's all we know. We don't know how the chef interprets the typo. We don't know what happens in the oven. And we don't actually know how it's exactly connected to how the cake didn't turn out or how you had expected it. A lot of that is unknown. But we can actually systematically try to break this down. And one segment of that journey that we're looking at is how that mutation gets translated and acted upon in your cells. And all of your cells have what's called mRNA. mRNA are the actual instructions that are taken from the DNA. And our work in Single-Cell is looking at how every cell in your body is actually interpreting your DNA slightly differently and what happens when healthy cells are interpreting the DNA instructions and when sick cells are interpreting those directions. And that is a ton of data. I just told you, there's 37 trillion cells. There's different large sets of mRNA in each cell. But the work that we've been funding is looking at how-- first of all, gathering that information. We've been incredibly lucky to be part of a very fast-moving field where we've gone from, in 2017, funding some methods work to now having really not complete, but nearly complete atlases of how the human body works, how flies work, how mice work at the single-cell level and being able to then try to piece together how does that all come together when you're healthy and when you're sick. And the neat thing about the inflection point where we're at in AI is that I can't look at this data and make sense of it. There's just too much of it. And biology is complex. Human bodies are complex. We need this much information. But the use of large language models can help us actually look at that data and gain insights, look at what trends are consistent with health and what trends are unsuspected. And eventually, our hope, through the use of these data sets that we've helped curate and the application of large language models, is to be able to formulate a virtual cell, a cell that's completely built off of the data sets of what we know about the human body, but allows us to manipulate, and learn faster and try new things to help move science and then medicine along."}

And one glucose scavenger I'd love for you to comment on is this assertion that taking a brisk walk after a meal, or maybe even a slow walk after a meal, some movement can help downshift the amount of circulating glucose in some way. I've heard that. Not a lot of people, but some are starting to pay attention to this idea of taking things like berberine or even metformin can scavenge glucose. I personally can't take berberine. If I take it, I get massive headaches unless I've ingested tons of sugar and carbohydrates. So I just don't mess around with it. But I know there are a number of people out there that want to know whether or not these glucose scavengers can be useful. LAYNE NORTON: I think that is really majoring in the minors, if I'm being honest. As far as the carb blockers, there's some white kidney bean extract and those sorts of things. They do block the digestion of carbohydrates, some. So when I say \"block,\" those watching or listening, metabolism is typically not on and off switches. So when we say things like \"block\" or \"attenuate\" or \"inhibit,\" typically we're not talking about just a switch on the wall that you press it, and everything turns off. We're talking about a dimmer switch, OK? So it just changes the emphasis. But these carb blockers can reduce the absorption of carbohydrate. Now, they don't seem to cause weight loss when you just do it in a normal diet. Now, why is that? Well, all it does is once those carbohydrates get to the large intestine and your bacteria get a hold of them, they start fermenting them to volatile fatty acids, which get reabsorbed into your liver. So you don't get the increase in blood glucose. But you still get almost all the calories from it. It's just in a different form. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I see. LAYNE NORTON: So carb blockers, if they actually worked really well, I mean, if you block something from being absorbed, your GI typically does not just let undigested material sit in there. You get diarrhea. I mean, that would be the outcome. It's also how I debunked the whole 30 grams of protein at a meal, you can't absorb any more than that. I'm like, if that was the case, when you ate a steak, you would just start having diarrhea every time you went over that 30-gram threshold, right? ANDREW HUBERMAN: I remember during college-- so this would be early '90s-- there was the Olestra craze. LAYNE NORTON: Oh, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: This idea of putting in a nondigestible thing into things like potato chips so that it would clear through the GI tract faster, not absorb as many calories."}

So there are various forms of liquid fish oil out there. Some of them include some lemon flavoring, so it doesn't taste like fish oil, because frankly, fish oil, to me, is sort of noxious tasting. And I'll take a tablespoon of that, or two, per day. If I'm traveling, I'll use the capsule form in order to hit that threshold. For me, about two, sometimes even three, grams per day of EPA. So not just two or three grams per day of fish oil, but two or three grams per day of EPA. Now, if I'm eating fish, which as I mentioned earlier, is not often, then I might reduce the amount of fish oil that I take. But that's my major source of fish oil. Currently, I do not supplement with phosphatidylserine. A number of people that I know and trust, and indeed, several colleagues of mine, do take phosphatidylserine. I don't have any good explanation for why I don't take it yet, but I have not tried supplementing with it yet. Maybe if some of you have, you can place your experience in the comment section. It would be of interest. And then in terms of choline, in order to get choline in my diet, I do pay attention to the various foods that contain choline, and I try and get those foods on a semi-regular basis. I do supplement with something called alpha-GPC, which is, essentially, in the acetylcholine pathway, or biosynthesis pathway. I don't take it very often, but I will take 300 milligrams of alpha-GPC from time to time. From time to time, I mean anywhere from two to three times per week. I'll generally do it early in the day, 'cause it, for me, can have a little bit of a stimulant effect. Although, it's not nearly as stimulating, say, as a double espresso, or triple espresso. But that's one way in which I enhance my choline function. And some people choose to get it from supplementation, because it's straightforward. There are a lot of supplements out there that contain alpha-GPC. Some people are taking dosages as high as 900 milligrams per day. That sounds very high to me. The studies of offsetting cognitive decline using alpha-GPC did use quite high dosages of 600 to 900, or even 1200, milligrams per day. So it has been used at those much higher concentrations. But because, fortunately, at least, not yet, or not to my awareness, I'm not suffering from any cognitive decline, I will supplement with 300 milligrams every now and again. Next on my list of compounds that have been shown in peer-reviewed research to improve neuronal and brain function is creatine."}

states or countries the different continents directions from one location to another even one's name all of those things are examples of long-term memory now I want to emphasize that long-term memory really has two components there are what we call declarative long-term memories so these are the things that we can declare things like facts about ourselves or the world or others and then there are procedural long-term memories procedural long-term memories as the name suggests are aspects of our memory that allow us to perform certain procedures they are literally action steps that we take to for instance ride a bicycle or drive a car which by the way we might not be conscious of ourselves doing after we learn that is after we pass information into our procedural long-term memory but even once those things become reflexive they are stored in our long-term memory now a discussion of long-term memory is not the focus today but me being a neuroscientist and I like to think you all generally being interested in the underlying biology I'll just mention that there's a key structure within the brain that is part of a larger neural network that is a collection of structures which is absolutely essential for the formation and storage of long-term memories and that's the hippocampus which in Latin means seahorse and it does look a little bit like a seahorse but you actually have one on each side of your brain so we say hippocampi plural and so what we know is that if people have damage to their hippocampus of any kind that people have trouble accessing or forming long-term memory sometimes both and there's a lot more that we could say about long-term memory indeed I did an entire episode of The hubman Lab podcast about the formation and storage of long-term memories including some tools to improve long-term memories we'll touch on a few of those tools later today but you can access that episode if you go to hubman lab.com and just put memory into the search function and you'll find it there in the meantime if we want to understand working memory we not only have to understand how it's different from long-term memory but also how it's different from short-term memories short-term memory is a capacity that we all have that as the name suggests represents a short-term memory bank for information that may or may not get passed into long-term memory so for instance if you've learned anything and of course you have if you can understand what I'm saying you've learned English language if you can write you've learned how to write Etc well in order to learn those things and to commit them to long-term memory the information required to do those things and to have that knowledge needed to be held in short-term memory and short-term memories are the sorts of memories that we maintain for somewhere between a few minutes and potentially a few hours maybe a little bit longer but only a certain percentage of that is passed into our long-term memory so for instance if you listen to this podcast or you go to a course lecture uh whether or not that lecture is about cognitive material or whether or not it's about learning a new physical skill regardless of what you learn you're only going to learn a certain amount of that information but were we to examine how much of the information you just heard or that you're hearing now you remember immediately after this podcast episode as compared to say a week later we know based on gosh millions of scientific papers and studies that you are going to have more information in your short-term memory stores shortly after being exposed to new information then you will later in other words only a small percentage of what we perceive what we see what we hear Etc gets passed into short-term memory and then only a fraction of that gets passed into long-term memory now the neural circuits for short-term memory and the passage of short-term memories into long-term memory involve a lot of different brain structures but here again we can implicate the hip hi campus Because the actual passage of short-term memories into long-term memories occurs in part within the hippocampus and then a lot of people don't know this some of the memories that we think of as long-term memories are actually distributed into the neocortex which is the outer portion of the brain now the point here is less to fill your mind with different names of things and nomenclature but rather to get you thinking about what's involved in creating short and long-term memories and equally important that even though the hippocampus is critically involved in the formation of short and long-term memories that the formation of short and long-term memories is really a network phenomenon in fact among the more important themes that comes up again and again on this podcast anytime that we're talking about Neuroscience or actually biology in any case is that rarely if ever is there one location in the brain where something happens typically it's a network phenomenon meaning it's the collaboration of a bunch of different brain areas passing information from one location to the next and storing it in a kind of distributed way way now another key thing to understand about working"}
{"question": "What are the key differences between formalized breathing practices like pranayama and the proposed Deliberately Variable Breathwork: Feldman Protocol, and how might varying breathing patterns affect brain function and overall health?", "doc_id": "GLgKkG44MGo_23", "video_id": "GLgKkG44MGo", "video_title": "Dr. Jack Feldman: Breathing for Mental & Physical Health & Performance", "video_header": "Deliberately Variable Breathwork: The Feldman Protocol", "segment_idx": "23", "time_start": "2:02:09", "time_end": "2:06:25", "context": "which is that it might be that the specific pattern of breathwork that one does is not as important as experiencing transitions between states based on deliberate breathwork or something to that extent, which I interpreted to mean that if I were to do box breathing with five second in, five seconds hold, five second exhale, five second hold for a couple of days, or maybe even a couple of minutes and then switch to 10 seconds or then switch to Tummo, that there's something powerful perhaps in the transitions and realizing the relationship between different patterns of breathing in those transitions, much in the same way that you can get into one of these cars at an amusement park that just goes at a constant rate and then stops. Very different than learning how to shift gears. I used to drive a manual. I still can so I'm thinking about a manual transmission, but even with an automatic transmission, you start to get a sense of how the vehicle behaves under different conditions. And I thought that was a beautiful seed for a potential breathwork practice that at least to my awareness, nobody has really formalized, which is that you introduce some variability within the practice that's somewhat random in order to be able to sense the relationship between different speeds and depths of inhales, exhales and holds and so forth. And essentially, it's like driving around the track, but with obstacles at different rates and breaking and restarting and things of that sort, that's how you learn how to drive. What do you think about that and if you like it enough, can we call it the Feldman protocol? - Oh, please [laughs]. I was asked in this BBC interview once why didn't I name it the Feldman complex, instead of pre-Botzinger complex? - You said I already have a Feldman complex. - Well, it sounds like a psychiatric disorder, but I think the primary effect is this disruptive effect, which I described, but the particular responses may clearly vary depending on what that disruption is. I don't know of any particular data, which are as in well controlled experiments, which can actually work through the different types of breathing patterns or simply with a box pattern, just varying the durations. I mean, pranayama is sort of similar, but the amount of time you spend going around the box is different. So, I don't really have much to say about this. I mean, this is why we need better controlled experiments in humans and I think this is where being able to study in rodents where you can have a wide range of perturbations while you're doing more invasive studies to really get down as to which regions are affected, how was the signal processing disrupted, which is still a hypothesis, but how it's disrupted could tell us a lot about maybe there's a resonant point at which there's an optimal effect when you take a particular breathing practice. And then when we talked about the fact that different breathing practices could be affecting the outcomes through different pathways. You have the olfactory pathway, you have a central pathway, you have a vagal pathway, you have a descending pathway, how different practices may change the summation of those things because I think all those things are probably involved, and we're just beginning to scratch the surface. And I just hope that we can get serious neuroscientists and psychologists to do the right experiments to get at this because I think there's a lot of value to human health here. - I do too, and it's one of the reasons my lab has shifted to these sorts of things in humans. I'm delighted that you're continuing to do the hardcore mechanistic work in mice and probably do work in humans already as well, if you're not already. And there are other groups, Epel Lab at UCF, and a number of, I'm starting to see some papers out there about respiration in humans a little bit, some more brain imaging. I can't help but ask about a somewhat unrelated topic,"}
{"question": "How can one successfully transition from a passion-driven activity to a field of study that may not offer the same level of sensory experience, and what role does curiosity play in this process?", "doc_id": "X8Hw8zeCDTA_13", "video_id": "X8Hw8zeCDTA", "video_title": "Dr. Maya Shankar: How to Shape Your Identity & Goals", "video_header": "Passions & Curiosity", "segment_idx": "13", "time_start": "1:06:32", "time_end": "1:13:16", "context": "So I want to go back to this injury, to summer at home, to discovery of something new. Was it at that point that you realized the feeling of excitement that I'm getting from learning about neurolinguistics and related topics is somehow similar to the excitement that I was feeling about the violin, or maybe even superseded that excitement? I mean, at what point were you able to make the pivot with confidence that this is the new trajectory? And an important component of that that I'd like to understand is you also had to cut ties with the past, something that's very hard to do. I mean, I grew up with a number of kids who became very successful teen athletes, really. And some of them, once they ceased to keep up or they had an injury or something, their identity stayed attached to the past in a way that did not allow them to move forward. Fortunately, many of them did find new identities in business or in other endeavors. Some became quite successful. But I've seen very often that when people achieve early success and then they hit a cliff, that it's very hard for them to part with that former identity. There's one of the perils of early success. Maya Shankar: Yeah, I wouldn't say that it superseded the excitement that I had with the violin. I would say the quality of the excitement felt very different. And that's actually important to convey because I think when someone loses the ability to have a passion, they're seeking exactly the same sensory experience, exactly the same high that they experienced the first time around. And I think that's a really high bar. And sometimes it's more of an apples and oranges type situation. So with the violin, there was a really deep sensory aspect to the experience. I mean, I felt things, right, you're playing and then you're feeling things emotionally. And it all felt super visceral, and that was where the passion emerged from. It was just this very visceral feeling of, like, this is so beautiful and awesome, and I love it. With the cognitive science stuff, my intellectual brain was delighted, and it's just like a different expression of passion. I think the big pressure test was not if I had held myself to the bar of do I love this as much as the violin, there's no way that I would have been confident enough to pursue anything at that point. So instead, I really think the question I asked myself at that time, which was a service to me and my more compromised psychology, was, am I curious enough about this thing to ask more questions about it? Do I want to learn more? And I found, naturally, three days later, I went to the library, and I got another book on the cognitive science of language, and then I got a book on the science of decision making. So there was curiosity, and honestly, that was all I needed. That was the little seedling that I needed to see if it could go somewhere more. I took that as a very strong signal. Like, I care to learn more about this, and I don't care to learn about everything, right? And I remember perusing the course book of my undergrad institution, and they had a cognitive science major, which was awesome because not all schools had one at the time. It was a very new major. It's interdisciplinary. You approach questions of the mind from multiple perspectives. So from the perspective of neuroscience, linguistics, philosophy, psychology, computer science, and anthropology. So you're just like a bunch of different disciplines. But that was when I thought, ooh, I can at least see if I can get into this major. I remember it was, like, a selective major. It was selective. And so I freaked out, of course, and had super impostor syndrome. It was like, I'm not going to get into the program. But thankfully, I got in, and I think that's where I was able to connect, like, this little seedling of curiosity to the actual pursuit of the thing. And that's a really important translation, because there can often be a mismatch. You're really passionate about something, but you actually hate the process. Like, you hate the actual work that's involved in getting better at it. And I was lucky in my undergrad because I fought my way, my mom style, barging into classes that really would only accept seniors or juniors, and I was like, I'm a lowly freshman, but accept me. And I was able to run experiments on adults, and I was actually able to see what it would be like to be a researcher, to ask novel questions and to get the delight that you feel right when you're in a lab and you're actually testing out new hypotheses. And so it was really important that I saw that I not only was excited, but that I could actually enjoy parts of the process of getting better. Andrew Huberman: I love your description of curiosity because it makes me think that in some way, it has something to do with a deep motivation and desire to figure out what's next or what's around the corner without an emotional attachment to the outcome. Curiosity is really just trying to figure out what's there as opposed to hoping that something specific is there. And sometimes even the surprises are more exciting than our predictions. I think the quote was initially from Dorothy Parker. I think this is debated, but I think it was. \"The cure for boredom is curiosity. There is no cure for curiosity.\" Maya Shankar: Oh, that's awesome. I hadn't heard that. Andrew Huberman: Yeah, I believe it was Dorothy Parker, sometimes misattributed to Agatha Christie, but I think it was Dorothy Parker. And what I love about it is that there's something about curiosity, that when it's genuine, it's self-amplifying. It's an upward spiral, because there is no endpoint. Right? I mean, that's one of the things that you learn early in science, is you learn, you test hypotheses, you get answers, and you get more questions, and you form hypotheses, and you do that until you die, basically. And they can be a little bit dark. But when you think about it as a journey, that it's just so much fun along the way. If you're just really interested in knowing what the answers are without getting too attached to the answers, it just feels like, even as I'm describing it now, they just can just fill you up, and it provides more energy for the next round and the next round. And that really came through in your description of cognitive science. I also find it interesting that you couldn't read sheet music, at least not very well. You were so deeply immersed in an endeavor, violin playing, that is not of verbal language. And then you went into a field that's about, or initially, you were sparked an interest in a field through an understanding of verbal language. And earlier you said that the thing that bridges the violin and what came"}

I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a Professor of Neurobiology and Ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today marks the third episode in our four episode series about mental health with Dr. Paul Conti. Today's episode deals with the topic of healthy relationships, how to define what a healthy relationship is, and how to achieve healthy relationships of all kinds, including romantic relationships, interpersonal relationships at work, friendships with family, and of course, with oneself. This episode builds on the framework of the psychology of self and mental health that was established in the first and second episodes of this series. However, even if you didn't listen to the first or second episode in this series, today's episode will still contain a lot of information and protocols that you will find valuable for improving your relationships. That said, if you have the opportunity to listen to the first and second episodes in this series, I think you'll find those to be tremendously beneficial at any point. During today's episode, Dr. Conti discusses what makes for a successful relationship of any kind, as well as tools to improve those relationships. He discusses various types of bonds, including healthy bonds and trauma bonds, not just in the context of romantic relationship, but in the context of all types of relationships. We also discuss different challenges that people face in relationships, including abusive relationships, and we discuss the role of power dynamics, anxiety, and boundaries in relationships, both from the perspective of unhealthy relationships, but more importantly from the understanding and protocols to cultivate healthy relationships. While there is an abundance of opinions and information out there on the Internet these days about relationships both healthy and unhealthy, today's discussion approaches the topic of relationships through an entirely different lens, which is the lens of the self in terms of one's conscious and subconscious mind, and how multiple conscious and subconscious minds through different individuals, interact with one another in ways that we can see and ways that we can't see, and all of that framed within the actionable steps that any of us can take to improve our relationship to ourself and to others."}

This business of how you conceptualize emotions is really the most powerful tool you can ever have in terms of understanding and regulating your emotional state. If you're willing to try and wrap your head around it, I realize it's not the simplest thing to do. But rather than think of emotions as just these labels, happy, sad, or depressed, thinking about emotions, excuse me, as elements of the brain and body that encompass levels of alertness that include a dynamic with the outside world and your perception of your internal state. And starting to really think about emotions in a structured way cannot only allow you to understand some of the pathology of when you might feel depressed or anxious or others are depressed and anxious, but also to develop a richer emotional experience to anything. Now of course, I don't expect that as you're out there interacting with friends and you're watching TV and experiencing life, that you should be parsing every bit of your experience in some sort of reductionist and mechanistic way. That's not the goal here. But for those of you that are practitioners, teachers of any kind, for those of you that are kids, for those of you that are trying to understand what your emotional life and your consciousness, dare I say the word, really consists of, I do believe that these are fundamental elements that are well-supported by the science across a variety of researchers doing things from a variety of different perspectives and some of whom agree with one another and some of whom don't. So I offer it to you as a source of knowledge from which you can start to think about your emotional life differently, I hope, as well as others in a way that builds more richness into that experience, not that detracts from it. One last point as it relates to that, many of you have asked me about psychedelic therapies that are now emerging, things like psilocybin and MDMA, we are of course going to dive into that topic deeply. We have an expert guest coming on to discuss that topic. Those compounds clearly affect the aspects of emotionality that we were talking about today, calmness, alertness, valence, good or bad, interoceptive, exteroceptive positioning. And so rather than just do a kind of cursory exploration of those compounds and what the therapeutic and scientific community is thinking about them and how they function, I think it's more important to embed that framework in our thinking so that when we address psychedelics and we address other sorts of therapies, cognitive behavioral therapy, different types of emotive therapies that relate to individuals and couples et cetera, that we are able to think about them with some sort of structure and rigor rather than just talk about them as a bunch of chemicals that produce these amazing experiences that people need to tell you about. Because if there's one truth, it seems that psychedelic seem to promote activity of storytelling about psychedelic experience. But that itself is not really what the therapeutic community and the academic communities are interested in, they're interested in trying to understand the universal truths, the universal biological shifts and psychological shifts that occur in the clinical use of those compounds. And so we're going to hold off for now, but we will get to them."}

disorder and at least from what I learned one of the more deadly psychiatric conditions yeah um but also quite common yes um is it possible that nucleus accumbens this so-called reward circuit is also involved in anorexia but somehow it is the resistance to eating the craving of the fasted state or something like that that's being reinforced and and I asked this for two reasons one because I'm genuinely curious about anorexia of observed anorexia in a number of people that I know and it's a striking thing to see somebody just resist food despite all better knowledge of the fact that they're getting quite ill maybe even at risk of death but the other reason is that if in fact nucleus accumbens is the site which can Harbor cells to promote craving and craving of fasted States so to speak then that I think might tell us something fundamental about how the brain works which is that structures don't control functions per se structures control dynamics of interactions sort of like a Orchestra conductor has a certain number of operations that they perform but really their main function is to coordinate the actions of a lot of things not to make sure that the violins always play in a certain way alongside the oboes you can tell I'm not a musician here I actually have an appreciation for the openings yes those usually get left out what's that the obos yeah they usually get ignored my partner plays the elbows oh yeah so yeah I think it's a great analogy by the way um you know I I make this statement it's a little controversial but I actually think people would understand where it's where I'm coming from um across all of these sort of sub-specialties of medicine uh but I actually think especially with obesity remember it's a phenotype that's reflective uh often but not always of a behavior um but if you consider patients that have obesity and they they exhibit some sort of compulsion towards food so they they overeat despite the risk of it I think those kinds of patients are more similar to anorexics than they are different um anorexia and obesity are both phenotypes that are at least in this specific case of obesity and in anorexia a result of a compulsion to either over or under eat despite the risk these types of compulsions are driven by societal pressures brain vulnerabilities that are probably more similar than they are different they just happen to manifest differently why they manifest differently is probably related to each predisposition or perhaps preference that's hard to know like you I have a personal connection to these Eating Disorders anorexia included and uh yeah I think it's um it's very scary and it's a condition that often instills fear in psychiatrists because I think you know not not everybody by the way I mean I have some phenomenal psychiatrists that I work with both at Stanford and at Penn they're also involved in my obesity study that take care of these patients I mean these are heroes but there's a lot of psychiatrists that are not in this domain that find anorexia scared for the reason you said it has the highest mortality of all psychiatric conditions that includes depression because not only can these patients die of suicide but they die of metabolic complications of being underweight um so it's a uh it is it is a scary condition I I relate with that I am trying over time to bridge what I'm doing in obesity and binging disorder to atorexia for two reasons one because I think these problems are more similar than they are different and two because of the need um and I think we're well positioned to sort of tackle anorexia um using similar approaches not identical but but similar approaches um the nucleus accumbens has been studied in patients with anorexia in China actually my postdoc my first postdoc who I had the honor to train uh when I was at Stanford as a neurosurgeon in China when before he came to me actually was involved in a trial of anorexia that had some benefits um and uh there's studies in Europe um and elsewhere that have examined preliminarily uh the effects of deep brain stimulation targeting the nucleus accumbens uh for anorexia colleagues of mine in Canada Andres lozado is a wonderful neurosurgeon scientist has been studying the effects of going after Area 25 which is directly connected to the nucleus accumbens by um you know it's a monosynaptic connection so in a lot of ways you know perhaps delivering stimulation there could could be very similar to delivering stimulation with nucleus accumbens it's all part of one critical inhibitory control circuit he's seen benefits as well um so I I definitely think there's some evidence that this is an area that we need to be studying um I think our more episodic approach with response to stimulation going after sort of a signal in the nucleus accumbens that seems to be related to the compulsion to withhold from eating I think is what we will be trying to accomplish uh in our study it's a right now just being conceived though uh yeah these studies they move so slowly because you have to get a grant that Grant gets reviewed by the NIH six months after you submit it often gets rejected because it's too Innovative and too high risk so then you have to edit it and decrease the risk so it takes by obesity so it took two years to get funded and I worry about that time frame because that's a lot of time for patients with anorexia to suffer that I might be able to help at least in a small sample of patients so um but that that is the nature of how these things go you also have to get FDA approval to do these kinds of things we try to do all of this in parallel it's an enormous undertaking and in a lot of ways we're starting from scratch but in some ways we have some preliminary data to go after this so my hope is in about a year we'll have a similar trial for anorexia at Penn so so more to come on that um and and we're not the only lab that's trying to go after because of the the clear need so what is the status of non-invasive brain stimulation ablation"}
{"question": "How can I capture at least 100,000 lux of natural light before 9:00 AM to set my circadian clock and improve my mental and physical health?", "doc_id": "NAATB55oxeQ_4", "video_id": "NAATB55oxeQ", "video_title": "How to Defeat Jetlag, Shift Work & Sleeplessness", "video_header": "The 100K Lux per morning goal", "segment_idx": "4", "time_start": "11:11", "time_end": "15:12", "context": "10:00 AM maybe, but before 9:00 AM assuming you're waking up sometime between five and 8:00 AM. Okay, so get 100,000 lux. Now you do not, I want to repeat, you do not want to stare at a 200,000 lux or a 100,000 lux light. It's very, very bright. The mechanism of circadian clock setting and this is very important, the mechanism of circadian clock setting involves these neurons in your eye that send electrical signals to this clock above the roof of your mouth and that system sums, meaning it adds photons, it's a very slow system. So let's say that I wake up and I look at my computer screen briefly or my phone screen. That's probably 500 to 1,000 lux. If I were to look at that for a full minute, I would get that photon energy transferred into electrical energy of neurons and it would be communicated to my circadian clock. However, the signal that it's morning will not have registered with the circadian clock unless I looked at that for a hundred minutes or more, so 100,000. Now the problem is if you wake up at eight o'clock, you're not going to get enough light from artificial light before you reach what's called the circadian dead zone. So you have this opportunity before 9:00 AM, maybe 10:00 AM to capture enough photons, and you have to do it with your eyes. I've discussed why that's important in previous episodes of the podcast, we have to do it with your eyes. There is no extra ocular photo reception. This is not about vitamin D in your skin. This is about setting your circadian clock which is paramount for mental and physical health. So here we're talking about trying to get that at least 100,000 photons but not all at once, but you got to get them before 9:00 AM-ish, maybe 10:00 AM. So what do you do? You go outside. If you want to get nerdy about this quantitative, you could download a free app like Light Meter and take a look around your house with Light Meter and you'll notice that even bright overhead lights are only emitting about 4,000 or 5,000 lux. It's going to take a long while of looking at those lights with eyes open in order to set your circadian clock and tell your brain and body that it's morning. Going outside even on a cloudy day could be 7,000, 10,000 lux. It's really remarkable how bright it is, meaning how much photon energy is coming through. So try and get 100,000 lux before that 9:00 AM. Now, if you can't do that because you live in an area of the world where it's just not bright enough. Some people have sent me pictures from Northern England. It's just not bright enough in winter. Then sure, you can resort to using artificial lights in order to get enough photons. And I'm putting out this 100,000 lux number as a target to get each day before 9:00 AM. You can in theory, get it all from artificial lights, but there are some special qualities about sunlight that make sunlight the better stimulus. First of all, it's free if it's available outside. There is a number of different... There are, excuse me, a number of different technologies kind of like this one like a light pad that this one says it's a 930 lux. I'm covering this up 'cause I'm not trying to promote any specific products. I actually bought this just with my own money on Amazon, they're not a sponsor. And it lets you toggle the brightness, I think by holding this on, holding down this button, you can make it dimmer or brighter. There's about 1,000 lux, it seems really bright, but a cloudy day outside will have five times more photon energy coming through. So some people set these lights or ring lights that they use for selfies and that kind of thing near their coffee or workstation first thing in the morning but you really want to get sunlight, okay? So those things are kind of nice because they'll travel and we're going to talk about jet lag. But I can't emphasize this enough that light has to be captured and summed before you enter the circadian dead zone which is the middle of the day. This is again, trying to achieve kind of perfect schedule. Then I've recommended, based on scientific literature, that you look at sunlight sometime around the time when the sun is setting and the reason for that of course is because it adjusts down the sensitivity of your eyes"}

And this actually gets me frustrated to the point of being motivated, where it's like people are saying, you're wrong, you're wrong. Know this, know that to the point of it's almost maddening. And far more seldom do we see people saying, okay, I'm in a third person myself, or I'm going to put myself in the other person's shoes and say, why might they feel that way? Why would this person be listening to this individual as opposed to this public health individual? And look, without taking any stance on this, because it's a much bigger conversation than we want to have right now, I could look at public health officials that just completely failed to understand the other side's position and vice versa. And that to me just says it's a communication failure. And I'll take this out of the COVID pandemic discussion as it's normally had and say that one thing that we know for sure is that in the 2020 to really 2022, but still 2023 landscape, there were so many mental health concerns. Everybody, regardless of where people were on the vaccine debate, mass debate, lockdown debate, regardless of any of that, everyone's stress level was elevated. Maya Shankar: Absolutely. Andrew Huberman: And there were very, very few top down from, at the level of government, discussions about how to maintain circadian rhythm and sleep health, how to maintain health in general in that landscape. And that, for me, was just really shocking. It was also one of the reasons why we launched the podcast, frankly, is that I really feel that the tools were needed by everybody and should be zero cost to everybody. But what was clear is there was so much pointing of fingers and name calling and violence even, that no one was saying, like, why would people feel this way? Why would people trust these sources as opposed to these sources? And we can only conclude if we're good scientists that the landscape was ineffective, right? It was just ineffective. And it continues. I mean, if you have the desire to take a reduction in dopamine by going on Twitter and following this back and forth that continues today, it's pretty ugly. Still, none of it seems really solution oriented. There are a few people out there who are trying to make it solution oriented, but not really. And so I don't want to go into the dark aspects here. But it does seem like this willingness to take a look at why others might feel the opposite of how we feel is a very rare quality. And this gentleman, Daryl, what was his last name? Maya Shankar: Daryl Davis. Andrew Huberman: I think I've seen a number of things with him. He's obviously extraordinary, but we call him that because people like him are exceedingly rare. So what can we do to cultivate that kind of mindset? Because I'm not pointing fingers here, I mean, I think we all have this default tendency to gather evidence the way that we gather evidence, draw conclusions, and then stand our ground. And I think it's detrimental to everyone. Maya Shankar: So you're making me reflect on probably the greatest gift that being a cognitive scientist has given me in my life. Obviously, it's fed my curiosity, it's been a delight to study things and learn things, but the greatest gift it has given me is empathy towards people. It is the greatest driver of human empathy to learn how our minds work. And I don't know if there's a substitute for that. Partly that's why I started A Slight Change of Plans . We have story episodes where you hear from people like Daryl, but I interview scientists from all over the world about their areas of expertise. And I genuinely believe that the more we learn about how the mind works, the more we learn from my field of cognitive science about how we make decisions, how we develop our attitudes and beliefs about the world, how we come to be the people that we are, the more we can bridge these empathy gaps. And it's been profound for me. I mean, I feel so lucky to have been steeped in this literature for decades now. But my hope is to invite people into the conversation, because the more you learn about why people are the way they are, the more empathy you can extend. And the more, I'm not even saying you need to extend an olive branch, I'm not saying that you need to compromise your own belief system, but at least you see that there might be an entry point, a reason to have a discussion with this person who believes things that are completely different from you. And we talked about gratitude a bit. In this conversation, I feel immense gratitude that I have a posture of empathy as I move around in this world, because I have strong beliefs on things. I care a lot. I care about reducing human suffering. And then I meet someone who I think is pro a policy that promotes human suffering. And of course, the visceral human instinct is like, to hell with you and your viewpoint, this is horrible, this is intolerable. But because I have this cognitive science hat on. It allows me to walk around with a slightly different viewpoint, and I really feel that I'm a better person as a result of that. And I've heard from listeners of A Slight Change of Plans when they listen to these science episodes, whether it's the science of loneliness, the science of empathy, the science of meditation, I try to bring this empathetic spin to understanding, again, neuroscience and psychology, they have found that they are kinder to others. And so that's probably the best feedback that I've ever received on the show, is like, people are like, I'm a nicer person to other people now, especially the ones I don't agree with. Andrew Huberman: And presumably to themselves as well. I know you've brought up the topic of empathy as a way to prevent burnout, right? And here we're not just talking about job burnout. We're talking about the burnout that is inherent to any long term pursuit that's challenging, raising kids, being in a family. What is the great Ram Das quote? Think you're enlightened? Go spend a week with your parents, no matter how enlightened you are. I remind myself that I love my parents. I love my parents, but it's just a completely different frame shift. But also kind to oneself. I mean, I think there's starting to be some good neuroscience at the mechanistic level of empathy. Clearly, empathy is not the default state for most people. It's something that we need to cultivate as a practice and that we can cultivate as a practice along the lines of empathy."}
{"question": "What is the recommended strategy for progressive overload, and how often should I de-load to avoid injury and continue making progress?", "doc_id": "UIy-WQCZd4M_13", "video_id": "UIy-WQCZd4M", "video_title": "Dr. Andy Galpin: Optimize Your Training Program for Fitness & Longevity | Huberman Lab Guest Series", "video_header": "7: Intensity, #8: Volume, Progressive Overload, “Deloading”", "segment_idx": "13", "time_start": "1:36:31", "time_end": "1:43:56", "context": "So we've discussed those at length in the previous episodes. We probably don't have the time to go back over all those details. So remember the adaptation you're training for and pick the appropriate rep range, total amount of sets, as well as the intensity to then get the corresponding adaptation. All you have to do is select those things. In terms of progression through a week, the rule of thumb we say for intensity is something around three 3% per week. For volume, it will depend on what you're doing a little bit, but any time you cross more than 10% per week, you're going to start running into problems. So I like 5% better. It doesn't need to be as low as three. You can jump up much more than that. 5% to 7% is better. So if you are doing, say, running, because the numbers make it easy, and you're doing 10 miles per week total. And if you were to go up to 11 miles the next week, great. You're right around 10%. But what you wouldn't want to do is say, I'm running 10 miles this week. And I did maybe four Monday, three Wednesday, three Friday. So four, three, and three, you got your 10. Then you wouldn't want to add a mile every day. So Monday, instead of doing four, I did five. Wednesday instead of doing three I did four. Friday instead of doing three I did four. What you actually did is you went from 10 to 13, which is a much higher jump than the 10% prescribed. So the same thing would be true for lifting weights. The same thing is actually true for calories and trying to add them, et cetera. So the body tends to not handle those things as well jumping more than 10% per week. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So keeping with this idea of increasing progressive overload, being 10% more over some period of time, am I correct in assuming that I want to identify one, maybe two meaningful variables and progressing that or those variables? ANDY GALPIN: So progressive overload can come in the form of any of the modifiable variables. So you could increase the complexity of the movement. You could increase the intensity or the load. You can increase the volume by either more sets, more reps, or more total exercises in a day. ANDREW HUBERMAN: What about time under tension? ANDY GALPIN: You can also manipulate how-- the tempo of each repetition. You can also manipulate how many times per day you train. So you can manipulate frequency. You can also manipulate rest intervals. So you can progressively load any of these things. Increase intensity. Run a little bit faster. Complete the same amount of work slightly faster. Put 5% more on the barbell, or the load, or the handle, or whatever you going to do. That's the simple way. If you want to think about volume, in the case of endurance work is simple-- mileage, time, whatever. In the case of lifting, all you have to do is take the amount of repetitions you're doing per set, multiply it by the sets, add that all up. So if you're doing three sets of 10, that's 30 repetitions. If you did three exercises, you just did 90 repetitions. Put that number down for Monday. Put that number down for Wednesday. Put that number down for Friday. Add that total up. So say you did 90, 90, 90. You would look and say, my total number of repetitions this week is 270. If I want to go up 5%, then I need to go up another 15 or so total repetitions. Great that's all we have to do. That's the increase. You may keep the load exactly the same, keep the exercises the same, change nothing else. But you want to add 15 more total reps for your week. And you may choose to do that by adding one more repetition per set. Close enough. So last week I did three sets of 10. This week I'm going to three sets of 11. It can be as simple as that. Again, it can be complex. I walked you through-- it can be any of the modifiable variables. But the progression I just laid out is fairly simple, and it's honestly the one I recommend for most people, just because it will avoid confusion and it will avoid people taking massive leaps in volume. So the typical strategy I would recommend here is increasing load or intensity, or a little bit of a combination, slowly for about six or so weeks and then taking what we generally call a de-load. So back down to maybe 70%. Whatever that number is you've been doing. So you did three sets of 10 and you worked yourself all the way up to three sets of 15. Back that down and maybe we'll do two sets of eight for the week. And then we'll come back the following week and go back and do the highest we've done. Now we're all of a sudden we're going to do four sets of 12 or something like that. So if you get these little de-loads every-- depending on what you're doing, four weeks or so-- you should be in a spot where you can continually progress for a very long time without either burning out or overloading, and over-stressing, and injury pattern. So the simple way, pick intensity or volume. And just go up slightly every week for a short span of time, generally around six weeks. And then you come back and change your strategy if you'd like. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Because you mentioned sets and repetitions here, I just wanted to remind folks that in the episode that we did on strength and hypertrophy-- and that also included speed-- there was a description of a terrific program for strength, which is the three by five program, or three to five program, as it's called, which is to select three to five exercises performed for three to five repetitions three to five times per week with three to five minutes rest in between those exercises. ANDY GALPIN: For three to five sets. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And if I recall correctly, the protocol for generating hypertrophy, muscle growth, is to perform a minimum of 10 and probably more like 15 to 20 sets per muscle group per week. And that can be done in a single session per muscle per week. So one could train, for instance, quadriceps one day per week, as long as you're getting that volume of sets per week. Or it could be divided up across two or three different sessions for that individual muscle group. Of course, people are going to target all their major muscle groups and hopefully some of the minor muscle groups as well. And as I recall, the number of repetitions that can generate hypertrophy is quite broad, anywhere from six repetitions all the way up to 30 repetitions. But by the end of the set, it should be to failure or close to failure with good form. Is that correct? ANDY GALPIN: Yeah. And we would say, close to failure is probably most appropriate. You can actually reach failure maybe on a few of the sets, maybe the end. And probably best to choose that with the exercises that are safer, not that any exercise is particularly unsafe if you do it appropriately. But you may not want to go to true failure on every set for the more complex, larger, riskier exercises. So hedge pretty close to failure, but not all the way. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And I realized I forgot to mention rest intervals between sets. It follows that if a large range of repetitions are performed that a large range of rest intervals are allowed, meaning that there could be rest intervals between sets of as low as 30 seconds between sets or as high of two or three minutes, depending on the loads that one is using. And that, of course, will scale with the number of repetitions. ANDY GALPIN: Excellent. In fact, that leads me into step number"}
{"question": "Can you feel the muscles in your pelvic floor when you contract and relax, and if so, how can you tell if they are functioning normally or if there is a problem with tightness or weakness?", "doc_id": "F54qXuTpgfM_3", "video_id": "F54qXuTpgfM", "video_title": "Dr. Rena Malik: Improving Sexual & Urological Health in Males and Females", "video_header": "What is a Healthy Pelvic Floor?", "segment_idx": "3", "time_start": "14:13", "time_end": "19:40", "context": "thank you for that so first question how does somebody know if their pelvic floor is too tight from a over contraction or chronic contraction of the muscles there versus too weak and one of the challenges in having this conversation is that if we were talking about contraction of the calf muscle or the bicep I think everyone intuitively knows because they've seen the shortening of the muscles when the muscle is quote unquote flexed and the lengthening of the muscles when it is relaxed um is there a way to describe pelvic floor muscular shortening in a way that everyone can understand would this be like um like I said we're going to be direct today would this like be like tensing up one's um uh anus and the opposite of of the movement that one would do before initiating a bowel movement and relaxation is sort of the pattern of pelvic floor muscular relaxation just prior to initiating a bowel movement so I will say most people can't recognize it because it's very difficult to notice it's sort of uh gradual and so it can over time become noticeable with these symptoms but otherwise it's very difficult because it's not a muscle that we were ever trained to recognize right like you hear about Kegel exercises for example and people talk about how to do them but that's all you ever hear about the pelvic floor and so you don't really know how to kind of do things in a way that protects your pelvic floor or um or kind of what how to even tell when it's too tight or not relaxing and so that takes a sort of a training and so usually when people come to First you get an examination to see if your pelvic floor is tight so for women it's a pelvic exam and for men it's usually a rectal exam how does how does that exam go so you know it's essentially palpating the muscles and also looking at the function so we'll say for digital palpation where that's a medical technology for fingers they're called digits uh so um you know I'm old enough to uh to recognize what a digital prostate exam is right the physician inserts their fingers through it into the anus and and and feels the prostate to see whether or not it's swollen or not and and as I'm saying this I'm realizing you know sometimes we think of medicine quote unquote modern medicine is so evolved this is basically basically been the practice for what 50 years 60 years maybe 100 years in the same way that the the old school practice for glaucoma excessive eye pressure was for the physician to just touch the eyeball so uh folks for those of you that think that medicine has evolved much uh it clearly has in many ways but um in any event so a prostate exam goes as I just described what would a what would a pelvic floor exam for a male and a pelvic floor exam for a female um involved at a kind of granular level yeah so for for women you can feel the pelvic floor muscles through the vagina so you can feel the iliococcygeus the pubic oxygous the levator Ani those are all names of different muscles in this bowl this is the physician who can feel them with their fingers correct and you know you could too you could put your finger in but you don't have a reference of normal right so you wouldn't know what a normal pelvic floor feels like versus a tight one versus a weak one and so you can assess the tenseness based on you know palpation you can also see if there's tenderness and so you can assess that based on just a general physical examination and then also you can observe so I can say contract your squeeze your pelvic floor up and then I can look and see are they squeezing or are they pushing like are they coordinated or not right because that's a function of normal use of the pelvic floor and sometimes you'll see that they're just coordinated you can also assess for sensation in the area and things like that that could be consequences of dysfunction can there be dysfunction in laterality like the pelvic floor is pulling up and to the right or up and to the left absolutely so what typically when you see a pelvic floor therapist now I'm not a pelvic floor therapist but these are the people who will do the work right they they work with you on a prolonged basis to help you normalize the function of your pelvic floor it's like going to the gym with a trainer right they really work with you to get your pelvic floor functioning correctly and the first step to that a lot of pelvic floor therapists will just align your bones and and your your kind of the way you sit and walk to make sure that you're not straining those muscles by pulling in different in different directions and if a male goes to the physician to get a pelvic floor exam um there's obviously difficulty in putting fingers into the urethra one would hope too small an opening so how are they doing the pelvic floor exam is it external to the body or is it through the anus so some of it's through the anus you can feel the muscles through the at least and then you can feel the perineal area and feel the muscles there as well as Sensations so okay so perineal area so from the outside of the body okay um the region between the scrotum and the anus yes okay so it sounds to me like if people want to get a high quality assessment of whether or not their pelvic floor is healthy or not they need to see a pelvic floor specialist that it's not the sort of thing that they could into on their own necessarily it would be difficult I mean so there are things you can buy online like probes that you can insert in the vagina that will teach you how to do kegel exercises and give you some read you know some readings but they're not really meant to diagnose they're usually something people use if they they have a weak pelvic floor and they want to try to do it at home on their own so there's nothing that's going to give you like a baseline reading is this normal or abnormal let's talk about kegels"}
{"question": "What is the optimal timing for increasing epinephrine levels to enhance memory consolidation and learning after a new experience or learning event?", "doc_id": "JPX8g8ibKFc_18", "video_id": "JPX8g8ibKFc", "video_title": "Using Cortisol & Adrenaline to Boost Our Energy & Immune System Function", "video_header": "Adrenaline/Stress Increase Performance & Memory. IF They Are After Learning", "segment_idx": "18", "time_start": "57:06", "time_end": "1:02:42", "context": "I actually had this happen once sat down to an exam and just blanked, just blanked. It only happened once, I don't know what happened. I don't think it was sleep deprivation but I just completely blanked. And it was very hard for me to pull myself out of that ditch. I did manage to do it, but it was a scary experience. So I think most people think about stress and an inability to perform. However, most of the time increases in epinephrine provided they are not through the roof lead to improved performance. Now this has been shown over and over again on memory tests, on learning new information, on physical performance. That when blood levels of epinephrine are low you don't perform very well. When blood levels of epinephrine are very high up to about 1500 to 1700 pg/mL. If anyone's out there, who's actually measuring this stuff but I doubt you are, performance goes way up. Performance gets better when you are alert and when you're a little bit stressed. Absolutely shown again, and again, and again. If you get too stressed, it's the mental side, it's the epinephrine in the brain that causes people to either focus on their somatic response too much. Like they feel like they're sweating, and they're focused on their bodily response, they're not focused on what it is they're trying to do, or say, or perform, et cetera, or learn. But epinephrine is a nootropic, it is a smart drug that we all make internally, and cortisol is as well. Now here's the twist that does not mean that you want epinephrine high during the exam necessarily. Memory and learning and performance are actually favored, they are enhanced by epinephrine increases immediately after learning. And that's something that's rarely discussed, the timing is vital. So if you learn some information, you have a conversation you're trying to learn a new language, a new motor skill. Whatever it is that you're trying to learn, the increase in epinephrine that occurs just afterward is what's going to consolidate the information. It's going to ensure that the proper circuits and mechanisms in the brain for neuroplasticity are engaged during sleep later that night or the next night which is when the real rewiring occurs. And You might say, \"That's crazy, why would that happen?\" Well, we have to remember, none of these mechanisms evolved for us to do what we want and learn what we want necessarily although they will allow us to do that. We've experienced this before, we might have gotten up, gone outside get in our car, drive to work or to somebody's house you're not thinking about much at all, and then all of a sudden you see an accident on the road. Your alertness is primed if it happens to be a particularly gory accident, there's going to be a lot of sensory information there. All of a sudden the adrenaline, epinephrine is released into your brain and body. Guess what? Not only will you not forget that event, but you will remember everything that led up to that event which has an adaptive function, because your brain and body's primary concern is safety, right? This is the neuro-biological explanation for Maslow's hierarchy of needs is safety first. And so you have heightened awareness and alertness for everything that preceded that spike in adrenaline and cortisol. So the way to think about this is if you need to learn something better, if you're taking Adderall, or you're taking a lot of coffee beforehand you're actually driving the process in the wrong direction. You're increasing epinephrine for learning sure, but past a certain point you're actually degrading learning and performance. The time to do that is toward the end or immediately after the learning, because this mechanism is not simply devoted to negative events like a car crash or a trauma, it works to make sure that the hippocampus that encodes memories as part of the memory and coding mechanisms is primed. That it's told what you just experienced is important, you're going to need that information later. And so I've talked many times before about using non sleep deep rest NSDR, or ensuring good night's sleep after learning. But what we're also talking about is as the learning event tapers off, as you're exiting that, to make sure that your epinephrine levels are not tapering off as well. And this may be one of the reasons why the 90 minute cycle, the so-called ultradian cycle for learning works, because it takes a few minutes to get into rhythm of learning. You can maintain that alertness for about 90 minutes, it's no coincidence that these podcasts are typically about 90 minutes long. And as you exit that 90 minutes you're going to start to feel fatigued. You're not going to be able to continue to secrete epinephrine at the same level. So I'm not telling you that at the end of this podcast you should give yourself a foot shock, or that you should jump into an ice bath. Although I will say, if you were to increase your epinephrine at the end of this episode by breathing or by way of cold shower, I'm willing to bet based on numerous published studies that the memory for the information would be enhanced. Because of this retroactive effect of epinephrine and cortisol. Put simply you can remember things better if you increase your alertness, AKA your level of epinephrine and cortisol after, immediately after something that you want to learn. So I'm reminded by people here at the Huberman Lab Podcast"}

Or people going and doing Ayahuasca journeys or MDMA, which is still an illegal drug in this country, but there are clinical trials. There are people on this campus doing experimental studies. I don't know of clinical trials, but at Johns Hopkins there are clinical trials, et cetera. So this is a vast area, right? Different chemistries for different drugs and different purposes. But the rationale, as I understand it, is take people who are in a pattern of addiction, launch them into a experience that's also chemical and extreme, often of the extreme serotonin and or extreme dopamine type. So MDMA, - Right. - ecstasy for instance. Tons of serotonin dumped, tons of dopamine dumped. How neurotoxic, if neurotoxic, debatable, et cetera, et cetera. Not a topic for now. But a lot. And then somehow that extreme experience wrapped inside of a supported network in there, whether or not there's just someone there or whether or not they're actively working through something with the patient, is supposed to eject the person into a life where drug use isn't as much of interest. This violates, at a purely rational level, this violates everything we've talked about in terms of dopamine biology. It would, if this arrangement is the way I described it, cause more addiction, is anything but a dopamine fast, it's a dopamine feast. So we hear about successful transitions through this, at least anecdotally, and maybe some clinical studies. What is going on? What is going on? It doesn't make any sense to me. Yeah. - Yeah, so I think it's good that you're skeptical. I think we all should be skeptical. Having said that, there are clinical studies showing, you know, and these are small studies and they're short duration, small number of subjects, but, you know, taking people for example, who are addicted to alcohol, and then having them have this, let's say a psychedelic experience in a very controlled setting. - So either, typically it's a high dose psilocybin, or three dose, as I saw it for the MAP study of MDMA. - Right. - Of ecstasy. Those are sort of the, seem to be the kind of, - Yes, the typical, right. - the kind of bread and butter of this kind of work. - Right, right. But the thing to really keep in mind is that this is completely interwoven with regular psychotherapy, and that these are highly selected individuals. - In clinical trials. - Right, right. And these are clinical- - we're referring to legal clinical trials. - Right, right. And so, you know, I think the metaphor that helps me think about this is there are many ways to the top of the mountain, and these are sort of like taking the gondola instead of walking up. It sort of, instead of doing like a year of psychoanalysis where you're sitting on the couch every week reflecting on your life, it's a condensed version of psychoanalysis or psychotherapy, plus, you know, MDMA, which gets you there faster. - And creates the intimacy, presumably, because of the- - Well I think the main thing that happens when it's beneficial, is it just allows the person to get outside of their own head and look at their lives on a much broader sweep, and to consider themselves not mired in the quotidian sort of details of their life, but rather as a human on the large planet Earth, in the vast universe. So I think it takes, it's like when it works, it's a transformational experience because it gives the person another lens through which to view their lives, which I think for some people is positive and powerful, because they can come back from that and be like oh my gosh, I care about my family, and I don't, I want X, Y, or Z for them. And I realize that my continuing to drink is not going to, you know, achieve that. So it's almost like a spiritual or values-based. So I think it can be very powerful, but having said that, I truly am quite skeptical because, you know, addiction is a chronic relapsing and remitting problem. It's hard for me to imagine that there's something that works very quickly short-term, that's going to work for a disease that's really long-lasting. - Yeah, the two addicts I know that did MDMA-assisted psychotherapy as part of this thing, both got worse. - Yeah. - But the people I know who had severe trauma who did this, who took this approach, seem to be doing better. - Okay, interesting. - And so I, I think that the discussion, as we hear it now, is just sort of psychedelics, which is a huge category that includes many different drugs and compounds with different effects. And we hear about trauma and addiction lumped together. And I think that I'm a splitter, not a lumper, as we say in science. And I think it's going to be important for people to know that this is definitely not a one-size fits all kind of thing. But it sounds like it may have some utility under certain conditions. - Yeah, I think so. I'm trying to be very open-minded about its potential utility for certain individuals. But I can tell you in my clinical work, what is a very concerning unintended consequence of this narrative, is I have a lot of people who are looking for some kind of spiritual awakening who on their own, not in the context of any kind of therapeutic, psychological work, you know, microdose or want to try psilocybin or MDMA with a friend or wherever, so they can have this spiritual experience that they can figure out their lives. That's a disaster and almost never works out well. And I've then had people who literally, supposedly you can't get addicted to psychedelics because, you know, something with the biochemistry which I don't fully understand, 'cause it doesn't make any sense to me. But I have patients clinically who definitely are addicted to, you know, MDMA, to micro-dosing. So that's very concerning to me 'cause like, you know, Pollan's \"How to Change Your Mind\", I respect that work, but on the other hand, it's penetrated the culture- - Michael Pollan's book. - Yeah, yeah. - And I don't know him and so I don't have a problem taking a stance. So I'll just say my stance on that is the narrative of popular authors can expand and wick out so fast, - Yes. - that pretty soon people are essentially taking their mental health into their own hands. And I actually, I have great optimism for this business of clinical use of psychedelics, including MDMA. Matthew Johnson at Johns Hopkins is doing fabulous work on this. And there are others too, of course. But those are controlled settings. - Right. - And the pharmacology is being tuned up. And one thing that I think is coming. There are several papers published recently in great journals like nature and science, et cetera, where there are scientists who are removing the hallucinogenic components of these drugs and finding that they still have the antidepressant effects. - Interesting. - And so the experience of a psychedelic, and the long-term effects of the psychedelic, might actually be dissociable. And so, again I, and I'm always careful to say I'm neither for something or against it. I just think that treading carefully is what's important. - I agree with you, and I can just tell you that the downstream effect for the average person, many of whom present in our clinic, is that they've misconstrued the data on the use of psychedelics for mental health conditions, to this idea that they're safe, or that anybody can take them in any circumstance and have this kind of awakening. And that's not what the data show, right? The data are these highly controlled settings, you know, carefully selected patients. So that's my worry, you know. - Sure. And I'm going to be sitting down with Matthew Johnson at some point, and we'll discuss this. And I think that, ah, that care and that cocoon of real clinical care, does seem to be an important component. - Yes. - Well I'm glad we could touch on it and, you know, I'm sure I'll get a bunch of comments telling me that, you know. But I think it is important to explore things from all sides, and that's what we do, as scientists. - Yes. - And if Michael Pollan wants to chat, we can do that too. That's fine. I very much enjoyed the book actually. - Yes, yes. - But I think that people run with ideas. - That's right. - They don't walk with them, they sprint. - That's right, right. Yeah. - There are a couple other things I just want to touch on, but they all relate to social media. - Okay. - You were featured in \"The Social Dilemma\"."}
{"question": "How can I create novelty in my motor practices and other activities to increase plasticity and learning potential, and what are some safe ways to explore the vestibular motor sensory space?", "doc_id": "hx3U64IXFOY_33", "video_id": "hx3U64IXFOY", "video_title": "Using Failures, Movement & Balance to Learn Faster", "video_header": "Novelty and Instability Are Key", "segment_idx": "33", "time_start": "1:11:18", "time_end": "1:14:53", "context": "So the more novel that a behavior is in terms of your relationship to gravity, the more it will open up the opportunity for plasticity. Have you ever seen somebody who just jumped out of a plane for the first time with a parachute? I don't even want to think about what, if you've just seen somebody who jumped out of a plane for the first time without a parachute, I just hope the plane was on the ground. But if you seen somebody after that, they are in this incredible state because their body and brain are flooded with all these neurochemicals because it's very novel to them. However, I've got friends from communities that have done thousands upon thousands, maybe tens of thousands of jumps, and they're always alert and aware, but it becomes pretty regular for them. That's the point. And they're not in this kind of buzzed out, excited state afterwards because it's routine for them. The key is to bring novelty to the vestibular motor experience, the vestibular motor commands that you're performing. How do you do that? Well, it's all about your orientation relative to gravity. Now, I wouldn't want anyone to place themselves at risk. So if you can't do handstands, don't try and do them, freestanding and whatever. If you're good at handstands, guess how much plasticity doing handstands for half an hour is going to create for you. Zero. Zero. Your body is fully comfortable walking on your hands. I see these people walking on your hands, being upside down, being inverted. Your Cirque du Soleil performers, they're very comfortable there, and there is zero learning, zero plasticity because the failures and errors and the relationship to gravity are very typical for that individual. Now, what this means is that if we're going to use motor practices to open up plasticity for learning, not just those practices, but maybe some cognitive skills or other things in the period that follows, we need to create a sense of novelty relative to gravity. And that means being either in a new position or slightly unstable. Believe it or not, I don't want anyone injuring themselves, but the sensation of falling or close to falling signals the cerebellum to signal the deep brain centers that release these neurochemicals that something is very different and we need to correct this error very, very fast. Now, earlier, I was talking about high contingencies for learning, and you definitely don't want to make it a kind of like either survive this or die kind of experience. I confess, I occasionally look at these parkour videos on YouTube. Believe it or not, a lot of those people have died, the ones that do these ridiculous things of hanging off of buildings and things. I am not suggesting you do that. Please don't do that. What I'm talking about is finding safe ways to explore the sensory motor vestibular space, as we call it, the relationship between those things. So that could be through yoga. If you're terrible at yoga, there's more opportunity for you to learn than somebody who's very skilled at yoga, for instance, or gymnastics, or handstands, or on your road bike. This is, unfortunately, what, I don't want to name brands, but stationary bikes where they give you the visual experience of moving through space, but you're not actually moving through physical space, there's no vestibular feedback. It's all visual. You're stationary on the bike. So unless you're hanging off the bike in your living room like almost to the point you're tipping the bike, you're not getting the actual vestibular motor sensory mismatch. That mismatch is the signal that deploys dopamine, epinephrin, and these other things. I don't care how excited or how much fun the ride was or how much music you're playing that you love, it's not the same situation as being out of your normal relationship to the gravitational pull. So the first gate is to arrive at learning at the appropriate level of autonomic arousal."}
{"question": "What is the optimal music tempo for increased motivation to exercise or engage in cognitive work?", "doc_id": "gveDhZW-rUk_9", "video_id": "gveDhZW-rUk", "video_title": "How to Use Music to Boost Motivation, Mood & Improve Learning | Huberman Lab Podcast", "video_header": "Tool: Movement; Motivation & Faster Music", "segment_idx": "9", "time_start": "44:23", "time_end": "50:47", "context": "circuits that are activated by music that deserve specific attention and deserve that specific attention now in the context of discussing motivation and music's ability to motivate Us in particular ways and those brain circuits are the basal ganglia okay so this is a set of circuits within the brain they're associated with action initiation so-called go circuits and withholding action so-called no-go circuits but basically the basal ganglia are involved in regulating movement and the cerebellum the cerebellum is sometimes referred to as the mini brain it looks like a little mini brain in the bottom back of the human brain and some species the cerebellum is much larger relative to the rest of the brain but in humans it's like this little piece in the back that looks like a little mini brain like you're carrying a second brain back there that's why I call it mini brain cerebellum it's involved in a lot of things but one of its primary functions is to encode rhythmic timing and processing and along with its outputs to some deeper brain stem areas things like the vestibular and cochlear nuclei we'll talk about this the parabrachial nucleus again you don't need to know these names it meaning the cerebellum along with the basal ganglia creates patterns of activity in our brain that Cascade down to particular circuits in our body so these are so-called pre-motor circuits and motor circuits that generate the sense that we not only can move but that we want to move and that we want to move in particular ways so if you internalize nothing from the last five minutes or so in which I've been describing how music impacts different neural circuits in the brain please do take away this important point which is that when we listen to music we think of that as an auditory experience but now you know that it's also an emotional experience and and this is a very important and when we listen to music it is programming a specific set of motor actions that are more likely to occur put differently when we listen to music we are more likely to move our body and not just dance not just move our torso our limbs or our Limbs and torso together in concert with the music but rather move our body from its current position to another position and this is one of the most important things to understand about music music despite being an auditory stimulus coming in through our ears evokes the activation of neural circuits in our brain that creates a sort of inertia it creates a propensity for Action across our entire body so now that you understand that listening to music activates lots of different brain circuits of course the circuits that respond to auditory stimuli so-called primary auditory cortex is powerfully activated by listening to music but also circuits associated with novelty anticipation we talked about circuits in the brain associated with memory but also circuits in the brain that are associated with generating movement and not just movement that is in sync with or corresponds to the music that we're listening to but all forms of movement but when we listen to music that has a relatively fast Cadence and we can actually Define what that Cadence needs to be and we'll do that in a moment when we do that so-called pre-motor circuitry the circuitry that's going to initiate that kind of inertia where that pressure for movement within the neural circuits that actually evoke movement are all activated so for those of you that like to listen to music while you exercise you're familiar with the fact that listening to great songs with a great beat with particular lyrics or that associate you with a particular time or place in your life can be very motivating but there are data showing that when people listen to music that's faster than about 140 to 150 beats per minute that it creates a heightened state of motivation in the body to move and the way that it does that is by way of Shifting the balance between those ghost circuits and no go circuits of the basal ganglia there's some other ways that it does it as well for instance music can evoke the release of certain neurochemicals called the catecholamines these include dopamine but also norepinephrine and epinephrine from centers in the brain and body glands in the body like the adrenal gland that shift the body toward a predic position of being more likely to move so if we want to distill all this out to a simple actionable takeaway simply know this listening to music relatively faster music predisposes you to be more motivated to move and that is independent this is what I find so cool it's independent of whether or not you're familiar with the song independent of whether or not the lyrics of the song are motivating lyrics if they are that's just going to layer on top of the faster Cadence which is going to predispose you to move but what's remarkable is that just listening to that faster Cadence Music is creating a neuronal resonance if you will a pattern of neuronal firing within you that is going to essentially take your and here I'm using metaphor is going to put your state of motivation from either back on your heels to being flat-footed or let's say you're mildly motivated so I'll call that flat-footed to being forward Center of mass so for any of you that are suffering from lack of motivation in particular to exercise but believe it or not also to do cognitive work where you're going to be still and you're going to sit down and you're going to read or learn or practice something listening to music for 10 to 15 minutes prior to doing that work prior to doing that exercise is one of the best ways to get motivated in order to engage in that work or engage in that exercise that's been demonstrated in the data very conclusively using a variety of different types of music and again there are multiple mechanisms that converge to create that heightened state of motivation some of those mechanisms are neurochemical like the release of the so-called catecholamine dopamine norepinephrine and epinephrine some of them are strictly neural circuit based so activation of premotor circuitry and those are going to combine with neural circuits that are going to narrow your field of vision this is a good thing whenever you want to be motivated they're going to literally constrict your field of vision to more of a tunnel type of vision as opposed to more panoramic vision and that I described it as placing you into a forward Center of mass I don't necessarily mean literally a forward Center of mass unless perhaps you're exercising like running leaning slightly forward what I'm talking about is using music as a way to deliberately shift your state of mind and body from one that is a motivated not motivated to more motivated and it's a very simple protocol extracted from the peer-reviewed literature you simply find some faster music hopefully music that you like it would be even better if it was music that had lyrics that you find motivating and listening to that for 10 to 15 minutes prior to engaging in whatever that work may be physical or cognitive on the topic of cognitive work one of the most common questions I get"}
{"question": "What is the role of adrenaline in the process of forming memories, particularly emotional ones, and how does it compare to the role of stress in memory formation?", "doc_id": "szqPAPKE5tQ_11", "video_id": "szqPAPKE5tQ", "video_title": "Understand & Improve Memory Using Science-Based Tools | Huberman Lab Podcast #72", "video_header": "Conditioned-Placed Avoidance/Preference, Adrenaline", "segment_idx": "11", "time_start": "41:42", "time_end": "47:07", "context": "were certainly not the first to demonstrate or to conceive of the idea that emotionally laden experiences are more easily remembered than other experiences. However, what they did next was immensely important for our understanding of memory and for our building of tools to enhance learning and memory. What they did was they evaluated the capacity for stress and for particular neuro chemicals associated with stress to improve our ability to learn information. Not just information that is emotional, but information of all kinds. So I'm going to describe some experiments done in animal models just very briefly, and then experiments done on humans subjects. Because McGaugh worked mainly on animals, also human subjects. Larry Cahill, almost exclusively on human subjects. If you take a rat or a mouse and put it in an arena where at one location the animal receives an electrical shock and then you come back the next day, you remove the shock evoking device and you let the animal move around that arena, that animal will, quite understandably, avoid the location where it was shocked. So called conditioned place aversion. That affect of avoiding that particular location occurs in one trial. That's a good example of one trial learning. So somehow the animal knows that it was shocked at that location, it remembers that. It is a hippocampal dependent learning. So animals that lack a hippocampus or who have their hippocampus pharmacologically or otherwise incapacitated, will not learn that new bit of information. But for animals that do, they remember it after the first time and every time. Unless, you are to block the release of certain chemicals in the brain and body and the chemicals I'm referring to are epinephrine, adrenaline, and to some extent the corticosterones. Things like cortisol. Now we know that the effect of getting one trial learning somehow involves epinephrine, at least in this particular experimental scenario. Because if researchers do the exact same experiment, and they have done the exact same experiment, but they introduce a pharmacological blocker of epinephrine, so that epinephrine is released in response to the shock, but it cannot actually bind to its receptors and have all its biological effects, well then the animal is perfectly happy to tread back into the area where it received the shock. It's almost as if it didn't know, or we have to assume, it didn't remember that it received the shock at that location. So it all seems pretty obvious when you hear it. Something bad happens in a location, you don't go back to that location. So that's condition place avoidance. But it turns out that the opposite is also true. Meaning for something called condition place preference you can take an animal, put it into an arena, feed it or reward it some how at one location in that arena. So you can give a hungry rat or mouse food at one particular location, take the animal out, come back the next day. No food is introduced, but it will go back to the location where it received the food. Or you can do any variant of this. You can make the arena a little bit chilly and provide warmth at that location. Or you can take a male animal. And it turns out male rats and mice will mate at any point. Or a female animal that's at the particular so called receptive phase of her mating cycle and give them an opportunity to mate at a give location, they'll go back to that location and wait away. This is perhaps why people go back to the same bar, or the seat at the bar, or the same restaurant and wait because of the one time they, you know, things worked out for them. Whatever the context was. Condition place preference. Condition place preference as with condition place avoidance depends on the release of adrenaline, right. It's not just about stress. It's about a heightened emotional state in the brain and body. Okay, this is really important. It's not just about stress. You can get one trial learning for positive events, condition place preference. And you can get one trial learning for negative events. Here I say positive and negative, I'm putting what's called valence on it. Making a value judgment about whether not the animal liked it or didn't like it. And we have to presume what the animal liked or didn't like and how it felt. But this turns out all to be true for humans as well. We know that because McGaugh and Cahill did experiments where they gave people a boring paragraph to read and only a boring paragraph to read. But one group of subjects was asked to read the paragraph and then to place their arm into very, very cold water. In fact, it was ice water. We know that placing one's arm into ice water, especially if it's up to the shoulder or near to it, evokes the release of adrenaline in the body. It's not an enormous release, but it's a significant increase. And yes, they measured adrenaline release. In some cases they also measured for things like cortisol, etc. And what they found is that if one evokes the release of adrenaline through this arm into ice water approach, the information that they read previously, just a few minutes before, was remembered, it was retained as well as emotionally intense information. But keep in mind the information that they read was not interesting at all. Or at least, it wasn't emotionally laden. This had to be the effect of adrenaline released into the brain and body, because if they blocked the release or the function of adrenaline in the brain and or body, they could block this effect."}

yeah yeah so you work on it just like someone's there uh the other half is using really good notebooks that's always made a big difference for me paper notebooks paper notebooks yeah yeah though though recently I've been messing around with a remarkable which is one of these digital notebooks where it's eink technology so it's like a Kindle but you can write on it uh but you have endless pages on it so I've been messing around with that recently but I remembered when I was a postto for example I found it recently I went and bought a lab notebook because those are expensive at least for a postto right they're like $70 because a lab notebook has have archival quality paper it's bound it's bound yeah people might not realize this lab notebooks need to be kept for many years yes you uh you're not supposed to tear Pages out of them and so they tend to be bound so if you have terrible handwriting like I do you just have to deal with it yes you can't rip it out and it's thick thick paper assd free archival paper big sturdy covers um but I bought this because I thought okay look I'm going to take it more seriously because I think that's also part of what goes on with the Whiteboard is your mind thinks about writing on uh the big vertical space as a a public crystallization of thoughts I'm putting this up for people to see even if there's no one actually there to see it and so you take it more seriously right if I'm writing on a a whiteboard in class I'm not just going to put up nonsense like I'm gonna be very careful about what I'm writing because you imagine there's an audience this is something for other people to see and so you get a little bit of a similar effect if you have a very nice notebook you think look I don't want to waste pages and somehow that helps with the thinking so then I found this notebook because I store my old notebooks in my closet so I found it when I was working on a recent book I found it I went through it right and then I started ticking off uh this turned into a paper this turned into a grant this notebook I used it for maybe two years only used maybe about half the pages it's all very careful neat script and diagrams I think I found seven different peer-reviewed papers or funded grants where the core ideas were in this notebook so it's like that $70 was a an incredible investment because when I when I got to work in that notebook it must have been pushing my thinking to a new level because it was an incredible concentration of actual publishable results were coming out of his Pages yeah it seems like we would all do well regardless of our field um to have some very low Bar Method of capture where if we just have an idea that spontaneously comes to mind that we can capture that in a voice memo or um dare I say in a a phone uh notes segment but then something as you're suggesting like a a whiteboard um like a bound notebook where the moment we look at it it brings about a level of seriousness yeah to our to our thinking and to our actions so like this is different than just um texting um I what we're really talking about our our kind of layers of sophistication um but not in a snobby way in terms of um highest productivity and quality to kind of um I don't know bubble gum wrapper on on the floor type levels of quote unquote productivity well I mean I become a fan of this idea of having specialized capture for specific type of work so for example I'm a big believer in pretty quickly you want to capture ideas in the tool you use to do that work so when I have ideas for an article or a book I'm going to go write the scrier which is uh specialty this is specialty software writers used to write right I want to go right to a scrier project and start putting these in the research section of that scrier project when I'm working on a math or computer science thing I might work out proof ideas on paper but I pretty quickly want to get that into a latch document so so the markup language that you use for doing sort of like applied math papers right the the the tool we use to actually write papers I'm going to move an idea into there as soon as I can I'm going to move proofs out of a notebook and into formally marked up like you would for a paper you know as soon as I would so this idea this is something I've been leaning to more is capture the notes in the tool you're going to use take out the middleman in some sense right so it's it's a reducing friction but also puts you in the right mind space like okay this idea I'm going to put it where I'm going to need it later as opposed to a more elaborate third party system that you construct that you then later pull everything out of as needed uh this is what I've been doing more recently let's just get straight to

I do realize that some people who are prone to anxiety, especially panic attacks, anxiety attacks, might avoid caffeine entirely. That's absolutely fine. You do not have to drink caffeine. So what I'm about to describe are ways to leverage caffeine use to optimize sleep and wakefulness if you are comfortable with caffeine, if you like caffeine, I happen to love caffeine. I like it in the form of coffee or espresso or yerba mate tea, in particular non-smoked varieties of yerba mate tea. Non-smoked because the smoked varieties seem to carry some carcinogenics, some cancer causing risk. There's increasing data on that. So non-smoked varieties of yerba mate. So caffeine is something that a lot of people consume early in the day. How much depends on your tolerance, and there's a lot of individual variability here. Again, caffeine is an adenosine antagonist, or effectively works as an adenosine antagonist and limits sleepiness. I highly recommend that everybody delay their caffeine intake for 90 to 120 minutes after waking. However painful it may be to eventually arrive at that 90 to 120 minutes after waking, you want, and I encourage you, to clear out whatever residual adenosine is circulating in your system in that first 90 to 120 minutes of the day. Get that sunlight exposure, get some movement to wake up, and then, and only then, start to ingest caffeine because what you'll do if you delay caffeine intake until 90 to 120 minutes after waking is you will avoid the so-called afternoon crash. And you may still get a little bit of dip in energy in the afternoon, but it's not going to be that massive crash. I've talked about the reasons for that crash on previous episodes. But if you delay your caffeine intake 90 to 120 minutes after waking, you are doing yourself a great service towards wakefulness and to avoid the crash. And the afternoon crash has another liability to it, which is typically people will emerge from that afternoon crash either grumpy or groggy and then they'll lean into drinking more caffeine, which can then disrupt their sleep. So wait 90 to 120 minutes after waking in the morning to drink caffeine. And if you drink caffeine at any point throughout the day, really try and avoid any caffeine, certainly avoid drinking more than a hundred milligrams of caffeine after 4:00 p.m. and probably even better to limit your last caffeine intake to 3:00 p.m. or even 2:00 p.m. And for many people, shifting that caffeine intake from immediately after waking in the morning to 90 to 120 minutes gives them a much longer arc of energy throughout the day and they don't feel the need to drink more caffeine later in the afternoon. If you do drink caffeine later in the afternoon, really try and limit the total amount or drink decaf. Certainly keep the total amount to less than a hundred milligrams if you are interested in getting into the best possible sleep. And I say this knowing that many people, including myself, can drink a double espresso with 200 milligrams of caffeine or more at 5:00 p.m. or even 6:00 p.m. or after dinner and still, quote, unquote, fall asleep fine or still sleep fine. However, there are terrific data, Matt Walker and I talked about this, and there are more and more papers all the time that point to the fact that caffeine intake late in the day, after 4:00 p.m. that is, can really disrupt the architecture of your sleep. So you might think you're sleeping well, but you're not sleeping nearly as well as you could if you avoided caffeine in those afternoon hours. Now, some of you might be doing your main about of exercise first thing in the morning and you want your caffeine before that about of exercise. In that case, I say, go for it. Drink your caffeine, do your workout right after waking up. I don't have a problem with that. You will find, however, that you're going to get an early afternoon dip in energy and that dip in energy is going to be substantial because it's going to be a dip in energy that naturally follows that workout from the morning. So it's dependent on temperature, and it's going to be related to the elimination of that adenosine blockade by caffeine. So you're getting a kind of a one-two punch on your energy levels by taking a lot of caffeine and exercising early in the day. You can sort of expect that you're going to get a drop in energy in the early afternoon. That's okay if that works for you, but just know that delaying that caffeine 90 to 120 minutes after waking would be the ideal scenario most days and most scenarios. All that said, I absolutely respect the fact that people have different work schedules, kid schedules, et cetera. So if you want to do some or none or all these tools, that's really up to you. I'm just providing them to you in the simplest form that I can possibly provide them."}

"time_end": "33:56", "context": "that you just described occur in similar or identical form during any waking States and I think you just said the answer is no meaning if I understand correctly this is a very very specialized brain State unique to sleep unique to a specific portion of sleep and that begs the question what is it doing so it turns out that all of these stages that we'll describe different stages of sleep do different things for your brain and your body at different times of night and it's very understandable that people sort of in the public will come over to me and say you know how do I get more deep sleep or how do I get more REM sleep and my question back to them firstly is why do you want more REM sleep and they'll say well isn't that the good stuff and I will say well it turns out that they're all important you need all of them but we can come on to let let I'll speak about non-rem sleep functions first and then I can probably I should unpack REM sleep um and then explain its functions but as an overview what we know is that during deep sleep first you switch over in terms of your body's nervous system to what we call the parasympathetic nervous system that you've spoke spoken about a lot before which is this kind of very quiescent calming state of your body's nervous system the sympathetic nervous system which is very poorly named because it's anything but sympathetic it's very aggravating and activating and um when we're awake that seems to be somewhat more dominant depending on what state you're in but in sleep especially in deep Sleep you shift over into this very strong parasympathetic quiescent calm State and that instigates together with other things um and we've demonstrated by the way that we published a paper probably about a year and a half ago that these slow waves and these sleep spindles and the cordination of them how well that they're coordinated seems to instigate a signal down into your body's what we call the autonomic nervous system which carries both the sympathetic and the sympathetic nervous system inside of it and forces you over into a parasympathetic state so these brain waves one of the things that they seem to be doing is transacting a message to your body's nervous system to say calm down quiet down what then happens firstly what we see is your cardiovascular system ramps down deep sleep you could argue is almost the very best form of blood pressure medication that you could ever wish for it's beautiful then something happens within your immune system we're start starting to unpack this but we still don't quite know why these pulsing deep slow brain wavves seem to be a trigger for instigating two things for your immune system firstly it stimulates the restocking of the Weaponry in your immune Arsenal so that you wake up the next day and you are a more robust immune individual so these are things like tea cells natural killer cells that sort correct all of that good stuff but what's also interesting there's a more recent discovery um it's not just that your body has um put back all of this Armory in place and in fact Amplified it but your body sensitivity to those immune factors has also increased so you've restocked the the weaponry and you've made your body more sensitive to those immune signals and that's why we will see in probably later discussions your immune system can start to become you know really markedly impaired when you're not getting enough sleep so that's a second benefit of the Deep Sleep um brain wave patterns the third benefit that we've realized is that it's very good at regulating your metabolic system and specifically your ability to control your blood sugar and your blood glucose and if we selectively deprive you of just deep sleep alone and we can do this now very cleverly it's not as though I see you going into deep sleep and I go into your bedroom and I wake you up and then you go back to sleep and which is how we used to do it sort of 10 years ago now we can use a very clever method where we play auditory tones to your brain but they are of a level that will not wake you up it's what's called a sub Awakening threshold and we determine that and by playing those tones it forces the brain to resurface out of deep sleep so you will still sleep a total eight hours but I will have selectively excised just your deep sleep and when I do that sure enough your blood sugar ability your ability to control your blood sugar I should say is impaired really quite demonstrably and it's for at least two reasons the initial thing is that your pancreas when it sees this spike in blood sugar it normally releases something called insulin and that insulin is a trigger to your body to say start absorbing the blood sugar so we don't get this toxic or we don't maintain this toxic spike in blood sugar your pancreas when you are underslept and specifically when you're not getting enough deep sleep does not release the appropriate amount of insulin worse still what we found is that's selectively depriving you of Deep Sleep means that what little insulin is released the cells in your body become less receptive to that insulin so you're not releasing enough of this chemical to say start absorbing blood sugar and the cells that are they designed to do the they stick a straw out into your bloodstream and they suck up the blood sugar they don't respond to the insulin anymore so on both sides of the blood sugar regulation equation you become imper and then I can give you an example upstairs in the brain one of the things that we found and we'll discuss is that deep sleep helps regulate your learning in your memory functions it helps start to move memories around in your brain and protect them and shift them from short term to long term deep sleep however we've now discovered is critical for drisking your Alzheimer's trajectory it's during deep sleep when you have a cleansing system in the brain that starts washing away the toxic proteins that build up by way of wakefulness and two of those toxic components are something that we call beta ameloid and Tow protein which are fundamental ingredients in the Alzheimer's disease brain equation so certainly I could then understand based on that Litany of things that I've just provided and those are only a few of what deep sleep is doing you could imagine that's the stuff that I want to get and that's the thing that I need to optim for not true because there is REM sleep I'd like to take a brief break and"}
{"question": "What is the optimal method for tracking and interpreting Heart Rate Variability (HRV) data, including how to determine a normal range, identify changes, and consider the impact of daily habits and stressors?", "doc_id": "juD99_sPWGU_20", "video_id": "juD99_sPWGU", "video_title": "Dr. Andy Galpin: Maximize Recovery to Achieve Fitness & Performance Goals | Huberman Lab",

rate mning heart rate heart rate variability cortisol free cortisol and on and on what are some of the other markers of stress as it relates to exercise adaptations and Recovery because once again I think we're seeing a lot of parallels between the study of psychological stress and the study of physical stress as it relates to exercise adaptation remember in terms of physiology stress is stress this is why we have this cool term of alistic load or allostasis so it's that it really doesn't matter which system you test for it will reflect overall stress uh you you mentioned several of them we've got done talking about some biomarkers HRV and heart rate are another great example because what you're trying to do is this when we were talking about the muscle soreness thing what we were really getting at was a marker of how do I fix the overuse in that particular muscle now we've really transitioned into Global markers of overuse and why these are problematic or important to pay attention to rather is again these are the indicators that you didn't just work a muscle out too hard but you have actually done something where you've compromised all of your physiology to a level where you've influenced a circulating catacol amine or something that's going to influence multiple markers now like your sleep and your mood and your behavior so that's why these things are problematic that said you could look at resting heart rate not a bad thing to do however that does have multiple downsides uh one thing we do know is your resting heart rate will Elevate with excessive stress load this actually doesn't matter if it is physical stress or psychological stress or a combination so you will see that number drift up over time here's the downside though it's not tremendously sensitive to smaller stressors uh in other words if you were to do something like alcohol is a very good example you will see your resting heart rate Elevate with alcohol use um excessive tobacco use and psychological stress however if you do something smaller like a hard training sessions resting heart rate is not sensitive enough to pick that up it will actually probably stay the same so for those reasons we don't actually use resting heart rate that much we will take it but it's not our primary indicator that being said HRV is a better use so just really quickly for those that are not familiar uh your heart rate uh let's say for example you your resting heart rate is 60 beats per minute that means every second it's beating it doesn't actually happen on a consistent Rhythm such that it would beat on second one beat on second two beat on second three Etc the rate is more variable so it might go beat beat beat beat beat be there's a variation in the heart rate and at the end of that 60 seconds in this example you would have still completed 60 beats they just aren't on the exact same pattern well one thing that's actually quite interesting is the amount of variation in your heart rate is actually associated with your overall sympathetic or parasympathetic State such that a large variation so an arhythmic pattern is generally more representative of being more rested and recovered and being more parasympathetic and you'll notice during times of extremely high stress uh you will be very rhythmic beat beat beat beat beat and so this is a little bit of a of a confusing idea but a high HRV is there indicated of a lot of variation meaning you're pretty recovered a low HRV meaning there's not a lot of variation means you're probably pretty stressed and wire so it's it's uh related to heart rate but in my opinion it is a significantly better marker of that now one thing you want to pay attention to if you do this a couple of things there are some accuracy issues with many of the devices basically everybody at this point probably has some device uh that's telling them their HRV what you do not want to do is simply compare your number to somebody else for a lot of reasons not all of these Technologies are actually even measuring the same thing um again some of them are actually combining with other metrics and calling it your overall Readiness or your recovery and so now we've what we've actually done is made a couple of assumptions and then stacked them on a whole host of other assumptions and then gave you a number and you don't know what that sort of black box score actually even represents so I would caution one against taking too much uh information from that if you are actually measuring HRV even within that there's a lots of ways to calculate it that are not important here so don't necessarily worry about the score compare it to yourself but not to others what you will see is if you use similar devices and techniques it's hard to find data here but in general people that are uh overweight um might have a little bit of a of a lower score as in a worse score um we need more information on that to be clear so in large part the best way to use something like HRV is to measure it under the exact same circumstances every day so whether you're going to use um just a device uh on your watch or your phone or your bed or anything else or you're going to buy a special HRV on it's fine just take that measure at the same time um mostly this means first thing in the morning so you wake up you go to the bathroom you come back down take your measure or something like that you don't uh wait sometimes you took it before food then after or look at your phone like all these other things that can influence stress so so take it it usually takes somewhere between seconds and minutes to record so you want to pay attention to that now one of the things you'll notice is there is a natural change in your HRV that just happens and so what you kind of really want to pay attention to is I guess answering the question of well how much of a change in HRV has to happen before I should care and it's hard to answer right so let's just say your HRV was 100 I just made that number up what if you wake up tomorrow it's 99 what's that mean well I don't know if you wake up tomorrow when it's 20 that's probably a bad thing well where's that line it's hard one thing I would recommend doing is taking your HRV for at least a month before you start using that value to make any changes and you recommend taking it first thing in the morning yep always at roughly the same time basically under the same circumstances it doesn't have to be technically in the morning but because your day will change on most days what you get into um that's the most stable thing in your life so I would take it then and I would collect it for at least a day at least a month rather maybe even six weeks and then give yourself basically a running average so what we quite honestly do is uh we will actually track it for forever and then what we always look at is what does it look like today relative to the last week on average and then what does that look like to our historical average and we always compare those things um and you also want to make sure you compare like to like so in other words I generally I'm not going to worry about today's HRV score relative to tomorrow's what I want to look at is today's relative to this exact same day last week um not for athletes but for non-athletes this is very important so imagine don't worry about the difference between hrb score and Monday compared to Tuesday pay attention to Monday compared to last Monday and the Monday before that that's because you typically have the same sort of weekly schedule and what you don't want to do is is say look at Monday's HRV score which is a reflection of what happen Sunday and compare that to Tuesdays which is actually a reflection of what happened Monday you probably didn't do the same stressors on Sunday as Monday so you're not actually comparing the same thing but if you have a General weekly schedule you're likely to compare this Monday's or to the last Mondays because they're both comparing what happened on the previous days see did that sort of Distinction make sense absolutely I do the same thing with body weight by the way if you're trying to track body mass gain or fat loss or something compare like the like you can look at the daily changes but you need to pay attention to what that normal distribution is so if you kind of do that you know Monday to Monday thing that'll give you a rough area of saying okay my normal weekly variation is say five so my average is 100 but I will fluctuate between 95 to 105 that's my standard deviation is sort of a science dorks would call that um if you start very uh changing more than 5% outside of your normal standard deviation then I'm going to start paying attention a little bit and I'm going to actually run a little bit of an algorithm on this one and so here is my thinking process when I get HRV really any metric but HRV is is the example we're using First Step did I collect good data and what that I mean again did I measure it the same way I measured every single day or did I get up and look at my phone first and I realized oh crap I forgot to take my HRV and then I went back and got there so say I had a 15% derivation from my normal number and then I realized oh yeah that's right I was up super late last night doing whatever okay great I'm going to consider that bad data you didn't good if it's bad data then I'm not doing anything ignore it's bad data and you throw it out you don't use it if you decide for the most part let's assume it was good data okay great then I'm going on to my next question which is is is it acute in other words is it just today right or is it chronic in words this is a is this pattern been happening for more than five days or at least three out of the last four or something like that three minimum is what I like honestly I generally look at five or more days that's a very big distinction if it is something that just happened today then the next question I'm going to ask myself is and I in that adaptation phase am I trying to be in a phase where I'm trying to cause insult to the body that it needs to respond with if that is the case I'm just going to ignore it right in fact it's almost sometimes a good sign hey we are stressing the body and it is stressed what we're doing is working amazing in fact if you don't see that it's sort of like maybe we're not doing enough to push the pace all right so great if the answer is no we're in a"}

But neuroplasticity is not an event, it's a process; meaning it has many, many steps. It occurs during wakefulness, it's consolidated during sleep and so forth. Taking a substance that increases a neurochemical in your brain will likely, provided it's the right substance and it's the right practice, will likely enhance the amplitude or the intensity of that practice and make it a more potent form of inducing neuroplasticity. Meaning it will create longer lasting or more robust brain changes than if one hadn't increased their chemistry in this way, this way of taking something. But that doesn't necessarily mean that you couldn't get to the very same place without it, by simply doing a slightly longer attitude practice or putting a little bit more mental effort into it. That said, I think the future of neuroplasticity really resides in not just one approach, not just neurochemistry and taking substances to increase neuroplasticity, not just behavioral practices to try and increase neuro-plasticity, not just brain machine interfaces or devices to increase neuro-plasticity, but rather the convergence of multiple tools. So you could imagine enhancing serotonergic transmission, as we say in the brain using something like Kanna, combined with a gratitude practice. In the not-too-distant future, this will probably also be combined with some sort of noninvasive device to stimulate the prefrontal cortex at the same time. Please don't do that recreationally. Those devices are for clinical use only currently. But I think you start to get the idea. So for those of you that are a little bit more exploratory and you want to go in and do some reading on this, I thought you might find Kanna interesting. I certainly did. There are a number of studies that will pop up on PubMed. I recommend using examine.com as your jumping off point. There are some decent studies that they described in their so-called human effect matrix. So those are studies done on humans. And the main effects that have been documented in the scientific literature are minor, but significant increases in cognition, executive function. Executive function is something that's also associated with prefrontal cortex, and reductions in anxiety. And that seems to be a common theme that we're seeing again and again. You saw this in the study, the trial where we saw reductions in TNF-alpha and reductions amygdala activation. Which would ostensibly lead to reductions in anxiety. You're seeing increases in activity in brain networks that are associated with feelings of wellbeing. So again, back to that kind of push-pull of defensive anxiety and fear-like circuitry in the brain being antagonistic, as we say, to the circuits that are associated with pro-social, feeling good, receiving good feelings, type circuitry and events in life. So as you now know, there is a lot of science about how gratitude can positively impact"}

So caffeine in some cases may not just increase dopamine release but it might actually have a protective effect on dopamine neurons. Now that's distinctly different from some claims that drugs like MDMA ecstasy have been it's been argued can, are neurotoxic for things like dopamine and serotonin neurons. The study that was published about that in the journal science, which is an extremely prestigious excellent journal later, it was shown that it wasn't MDMA ecstasy that was given in that case. It was actually amphetamine, which is known to destroy dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons. So what does this mean? This means that low levels of caffeine may at least in a few studies be protective for dopamine neurons over time that MDMA ecstasy something that's in clinical trials right now for the treatment of trauma PTSD of various kinds and depression but still illegal at this point in time may although it doesn't appear yet from any published studies destroy dopaminergic neurons, perhaps origin, urgent neuron. So there's a real asterix and a question mark there but amphetamine and in particular methamphetamine is very destructive for dopaminergic neurons.

at least four different ways there are methods for electrical brain stimulation there are methods for acoustic stimulation of sleep so electrical stimulation of sleep acoustic stimulation of sleep

stimulation we're trying to stimulate the brain specifically the cortex and the way that we do this is that we apply electrode pads to your head and we insert a small amount of voltage into your brain now it's so small that you typically don't feel it but it has a measurable impact on that electrical brain activity so very early on scientists and we weren't the first to do do this by any means there was a great paper now famous paper in my field by um wonderful scientist yam born in Germany and they took a group of subjects and they applied these electrod pads and specifically to the front of the brain and I'll explain why we target the front of the brain with sleep electrical enhancement or the electrocutica as it were they applied these electr pads to two groups of participants and then they let them go into sleep and as you'll remember we described that in the first 2 or 3 hours of sleep is when you get most of your deep sleep and they were targeting those deep slow brain waves that we spoke about those big slow powerful waves that define deep sleep and what they did in one of those groups the other group was the placebo group they still had the electrodes applied they still went to sleep in the stimulation group they waited until those individuals went into deep sleep and I told you in the first episode that those deep sleep brain waves were going up and down very very slowly maybe just once or twice a second so they started to stimulate the brain inputting the stimulation pulses at a very slow Rhythm trying to match the rhythm of the brain in fact they were less than one Hertz less than one cycle per second in terms of a pulse it's almost as though we're trying to act like a a choir to a flagging lead vocalist and as these brain waves are going up and down you're trying to sing in time with those deep sleep brain waves and in doing so you're trying to boost and amplify the size of those deep sleep brain waves now to begin with they just waited until they went into deep sleep and they started to stimulate at that frequency and I'll come back to why that's important in a second but sure enough what they demonstrated they were able to boost the electrical quality of that deep sleep by about 60% and they were also able to almost double the amount of memory benefit that sleep provided wow which is very impressive that is impressive now I should note that there was more recently a replication attempt of that paper and they did very good job they really did it to the letter and they weren't able to replicate the effects as powerfully however subsequent Studies have now taken a more nuanced approach and it's the one that we've taken too and it's called closed loop stimulation Clos Loop here simply means that I'm not going to just wait until you go into deep sleep and then just take a chance and start stimulating your brain not knowing of the synchrony of my pulses into your brain relative to the brain waves that you're experiencing closed loop does do that so what I'm doing is I'm measuring the electrical brain waves that occurring and because they're nice and slow they're very predictable and I can program my algorithm and my brain stimulation machine to say I'm going to wait and wait and as soon as you are on this peak of your slow wave it turns out to be the negative trough but I'll forgo that we then try to strike at that point of midnight when you're going through the biggest sort of powerful sort of dip in the the brain wave and we're trying to sort of enhance it and same with the peak so this is where we take a we get a stimulus from the brain your electrical brain activity and then we create a timed response so it's a stimulus response it's a call and response Loop and by way of doing that it's a much smarter specific method than a more generalized I'm just going to stimulate and hope I catch those waves at the Peaks the reason is important because different people have different speeds of their slow brain waves they're all slow but your speed of brain wave may be a little bit different to mine and if I'm off with my stimulation by let's say just half a second or a quarter of a second time and time again I may be leaving some benefit on the table but closed loop stimulation creates this personalized electrical prescription of stimulation and when you do that you get very reliable benefits you can boost those deep slope brain waves you get the memory benefits but also what we found is you not only boost those deep sleep brain waves you boost another electrical signature that I spoke about in the first episode called sleep spindles and it seems to be the combination of those two things by way of electrical stimulation that provides the benefits now I should know I haven't mentioned this before you can buy these devices on the internet DIY style do not do that if you go on to the internet too you can also find some horror stories people have misappropriated the voltage they've got skin burs they've lost their eyesight for several weeks do not do this at home I promise you use you know wait until these products come out and that's one of the reasons why we've scaled it into a company and we're we're trying to do this we've got a long way to go yet huge number of trials that we have to do before you know I feel ready to to Really lay it on the on the table and say you should absolutely buy this it's it's well worth it but we're getting very very close I would say great what about thermal manipulations temperature"}
{"question": "What are some effective ways to gauge recovery after intense exercise, and how can I incorporate heat exposure, cold showers, or other forms of thermal stress into my training and recovery routine?", "doc_id": "IAnhFUUCq6c_17", "video_id": "IAnhFUUCq6c", "video_title": "Dr. Andy Galpin: How to Build Strength, Muscle Size & Endurance", "video_header": "Heat Exposure & Training", "segment_idx": "17", "time_start": "2:43:18", "time_end": "2:53:44", "context": "because I'm sure there are a number of ways in which heat can short circuit all sorts of things. I mean, heat in excess can kill you. It can shut down fertility. It can, in excess, right? It can do all sorts of things, but it can also increase growth hormone, increase vasodilation, improve one's ability to sweat, which can be very beneficial in a number of contexts. - Yep. - For the typical, for 75% of people, 75% of the time, when do you think heat is most useful? And here I'm referring to dry sauna or wet sauna. I'm not specifically talking about infrared sauna because the data there are a little unclear to me. And I don't even know that, my sense with infrared saunas is they don't go hot enough for my particular taste. - You and I have a similar taste there. - Okay, yeah. - If we're not crushing 200 past I'm not interested. - Right, and my sense about infrared sauna is that, maybe I haven't seen the data, is that, but that a lot of people like it 'cause they like the way they look in the infrared sauna. It feels cool, it feels like you're doing something unusual. Now infrared lights are beneficial for other reasons, actually for mitochondrial health and the retinas, the good data, but infrared sauna to me it never goes hot enough. So I'm talking about 200 or hotter, maybe 180 to 220. Obviously do what's safe folks, and heed all the warnings about pregnant people not going in saunas, et cetera. - I assume you're lumping in hot water immersion- - Hot water immersion, so hot baths, hot sauna. When do you think most people could leverage sauna or hot baths to benefit their training and fitness and health? - Yeah, okay, I have a handful of things to say about this topic. One of 'em is, you never have a hard time convincing people to get hot. Everyone feels good. Like yeah, get in a hot bath, like, can you take more hot showers? Sure. Like no problem there, right. There are a handful of studies that have looked at this immediately post, and it seems to even augment hypertrophy. - So after hypertrophy training, getting in the sauna for 20 minutes. - Yeah, whatever, whatever it needs to be. We don't have a good titration. What's the number minutes wise. We don't have a temperature titration. - Hot shower would be a second, would be a weak second best. - I would say it's a very weak- - To the hot bath. - I think a hot bath is probably a lot closer to what you're looking for. It actually kind of goes back to our initial conversations. Theoretically, you're just going to aiding blood flow. So you're going to put more nutrients in, more waste product out, metabolic stress, all that stuff is going through. So that's the thought anyways, we're far from knowing, - Makes sense. - Plausible, right. Absolutely plausible. Something people will do. Feels good. Let's say, with cold and hot, I want to caution you against a couple of things. This is true across all physiology, but you need to be really careful about moving percentages from molecular to outcome. Very careful. So for example, it's easy to see a paper that says, okay, we put you in a hot bath or something, and we saw a growth hormone increase 300%. That is not going to result in 300% increase in muscle size, right? In fact, 300% might result in absolutely no change in a physical size, right? And the reason I'm saying this is because there's a lot of people in this space that will misapply the mechanisms. And they'll grossly overestimate what these things can do and what they do do, because they'll find something like that. I mean you know this, you've done enough cellular work too. In the lab, if I see mTOR doubled, I think shit, it didn't work. I need to see a 10 X increase before I know it's even physiologically relevant. So reading that paper, reading someone's social media post, you're like wow, it increased mTOR 38%. I'm like, well, that didn't work. And you're like, wow, that's huge. I'm like, that's not 38% increase in muscle size. So that's a very important point I want to make, because I'm going to talk about the benefits here in a second. But I don't want people to be fooled into thinking that this is some crazy miracle. The same thing with the sauna. In terms of general health outcomes, it is clearly a beneficial thing. This is a really good idea to get hot a lot. It is not a substitute for exercise though. It's a very important distinction. If the options are nothing or sauna, get in the sauna. Really, really good idea. If the exchange is though, I don't need to work out because I did the sauna, bad. This is not a winning solution. - You and I know some maniacs that actually work out in the sauna. - Oh, we do. Yeah, kind of not far away. - I don't necessarily recommend that. That actually would probably kill a large number of people. But it can be worked- - Yeah, if they die, they die. - It can be worked up to. - Yeah. - Certainly. - Yeah. So I want, like every time I talk about that I flag that, because it's just too easy to hear that and go, oh, well I think Dr. Huberman said, if I just get in the sauna, I don't have to work out. Like no, no, those words have never come out of his mouth. - He definitely didn't say that. And I'm definitely not working out in the sauna. If I'm in the sauna, I'm either sitting or I'm lying down, and I'm trying to make it through. I tend to do three 20 minute bouts, across the entire week. So I aim for 60 minutes per week of heat exposure. - I would be lying, - Which is not a ton. - if I said I've never worked out in the sauna. - Oh, so you're one of those. Yeah, people will do air squats, they'll bring the Airdyne bike in there. I look at the sauna as kind of a time to get lazy and sweat. - Totally fine. Going back to your original question. So potential the plausible aid, we need to see more research on that to really get a, do I need to put this in practice. I think if you try it, very little harm. I struggle to see a downside. If you make sure your hydration's on point, right, 'cause now you got to factor in the fact you just kicked out two or three pounds. If you at 200 plus pounds, I assume, or roughly, if you're in the sauna for 20 minutes, I would imagine you can do two or three pounds. - Yeah, I usually, I hover somewhere around like 225. And I drink a 32 ounce, it's water with a electrolyte solution that's pretty high salt afterwards. And sometimes during. And sometimes after that, if I do it late in the evening, I'll go to sleep and I'll wake up in the middle of the night just feeling so parched. It's amazing how much water one loses in the sauna. - Like a normal sweat rate for someone 225, especially in 20 minutes in a sauna, I would absolutely expect you to do three pounds easy, without like- - So I should be drinking more? - Probably. - Even more water. - Yeah, you're probably half the water that you need to get. - And you mentioned the possible benefits of doing it after strength hypertrophy training, which makes sense for plausible mechanistic reasons, no official data there yet. What about after endurance training? Assuming somebody hydrates well enough and they're not overheated from their endurance work. - Yeah. - Could also be of benefit. - Yeah. - Wow, so more and more what I'm thinking the framework here is in an ideal world, one would train and then do sauna, or heat exposure of some kind. Endurance training or strength hypertrophy training, and then do sauna, and then do cold exposure on off days, or at least four hours away from any kind of training, or if you had to do it close to training, doing it before training. - Yeah, I love cold in the morning. We've actually run this experiment on professional athletes, where we do enough tracking with things like HRV, which is a global metric of like overall fatigue, okay. And you've probably talked about that before but, problems with it, but roughly idea of overall fatigue. HRV in general, higher the score the better, right? So a low HRV is fatigue, right? Well, if you wake up and take your HRV in the morning, and then you get into ice, what's going to happen is you're going to see that number plummet. The second you get out, that's going to fall off the Earth, which means roughly you've moved into a sympathetic place. Surprising, you get in 30 degree water, you're going to go very sympathetic very quickly. However, if you continue to watch your HRV for 30, 60, 90, and up to two to three hours post, you will generally see an improved HRV score relative to where you started. So it's back to this hormetic stressor, right? A really cold, shocking exposure will be a net result of you being more relaxed throughout the day. In general. And we've seen that now like very consistently across years, with athletes. So I think it's a great way to start your day. You won't need nearly as much coffee after spending three minutes in 30 degree water. - 30 degrees is pretty darn cold. I was in the ocean this morning for about three minutes. It felt, I didn't bring a thermometer, but it felt like somewhere in the low 50s. - But 50 and moving is really cold. - Yeah. - Water's moving. - Yeah. - Right. That's really cold - That's right. The thermal layer that surrounds you when you sit still in cold water immersion, I'm encouraging people now, if they really, I was, joked that people like to look real stoic and tough when they're in there. Like they're just grinding through it with no pain at all. But the stillness is actually reducing the stimulus. If they sift around a little bit, you break up that thermal layer. That's where the real action is. - We've joked about this for years. Like do 50 degrees with a whirlpool jet on, now I'm impressed. 'Cause that is hard. You sit in 35 degree for three minutes, I guess. But with XPT I've seen, I can't even tell you how many hundreds of people from all walks of life, on all age, that we've been able to get in 30-something degree water for three minutes. 50 degrees with a whirlpool going, that number gets very small. - Yeah, and if you don't have access to a whirlpool, this should be reassuring to you, you can, some people say oh, you know, I don't have access to ice, and ice can actually get pretty expensive, if you're doing a $50 ice bath - Yeah, it's- - every day. So you can fill your bathtub with cool to cold water, get in, but just make sure that you keep sifting your limbs and it's chilly. - Yeah. - And the studies on the very well, now well established increases in dopamine and epinephrine that occur in cold water exposure, were actually done at an hour in 60 degrees Fahrenheit. - Yeah. - And so it, you don't necessarily need it ice cold or an ice bath. But immersion is really better than the cold shower. The cold shower is kind of a, it's the, it's kind of the espresso shot version. - Yep, no it's sort of funny, 'cause if you look at most of those initial studies and you think, man, how do they get people to sign up to spend 45 minutes in 55 degree water. 55 degrees is cold. Even if it's not moving and then they're going to not spend five minutes in 'em, they're going to go an hour. And if you've ever done ice baths at that temperature, you know like all right after a few minutes, it's not that bad. But man, that's a protocol. - Yeah, it's kind of a cold endurance protocol. 'Cause it's one thing to get in for one minute to three minutes, and you know you're getting out. You could sing a song, you could do anything to distract yourself. But 45 minutes to an hour is intense. Maybe they, I don't know. I don't think they paid the subjects. But anyway, that study was done - Yeah, you think- - in Europe, I forget where it was done. But anyway, they were hardy subjects. I want to talk a bit about over-training and gauging recovery. So there are a couple methods that I've heard about,"}

sitting there in Bliss and thinking about all the great things that happened how you made it through like there's still a lot happening right now so um to the extent that you can share um you're working all the time you're what what are you doing nowadays as a vocation I was in private equity for a while before I met you run a company for companies for really good friend of mine and Tom Ripley amazing guy and then I stepped away because I was exhausted and I didn't know how to say it I didn't know how to tell anybody like I needed to escape again take Magic Flight somehow you know and um and he and I are incredibly close like he was one of the guys who is in that super tight Inner Circle um and then I came back to it um with you know with this team that I'm on and I serve as the chief operating officer at lid Sports Group the largest brick and mortar licensed Sports retailer um in North America we have 200,000 stores during the holiday we have 88,200 employees and amazing team the private Equity Firm that I work for is an amazing team and the company's an amazing company and am just incredible group of folks um and so yeah I work a lot I was out here doing store visits in San Francisco and la and that's it's all good and I think um I do those little things all day long all the time but no I am not sitting on a Mountaintop like most days there's no meditation at all Andrew it's meditation is a workout Tom and I throw kettle bells around multiple times a week and um I do those other little things but the difference for me is I'm okay with it and I say that because I was incredibly busy you know before when I first got out of the Navy and I wasn't okay with it because I thought again this is back to the hero's journey I thought like the return to ordinary life was going to be sunshine and rainbows like look I have the ultimate Boon I had this big experience not that I wanted to be like front and center in the media but here I am world it's calm out here right like we get to chill and have a good time and sleep and nothing is stressful in the real world right wrong I just wasn't ready for that like I really genuinely thought that it was just gonna be easier and so when we talk about the lowgrade pain inury and like the you know what is that to me that was one of the biggest frictions like holy I did all this stuff all these deployments lost all these buddies and there's no rest like the regular world just it's not it's supposed to be easier at least that's the story that was in my mind going through all the stuff we just talked about now I'm okay with it like I like it I know how to manage my life I know how to manage my time for the most part I have a different relationship with my teammates and my mentors and my bosses and my own work life and I love it like I feel like I'm back to in a very different way where I was when I was in the Squadron back in ' 07 I I feel like I'm on hope this doesn't get clipped but for me I'm on another level like I really feel good about where I'm headed and I haven't felt like that since I went into college you know I felt like was just deteriorating and now it's it's not which is which is nice well the beauty of what you just said and everything you've shared today is that I don't know if it occurs to you or not but um you've been providing mentorship to millions of people uh in the form of sharing your experience of uh your own Heroes journey and uh I want to thank you for making it so clear as to what your experience was and being unafraid or perhaps afraid and doing it and telling us anyway exactly very afraid what that felt like even better in that sense you know and and stepping into that fear um but also making it so clear that while while your your life experience is you know extraordinary SEAL Teams tier one teams all all and all you know all of it that you know everyone's life has these components of extraordinary and the opportunity for Extraordinary and the return and

Maybe-- if you want to just briefly mention that because I was talking with you about this before we started. The puberty that I'm most familiar with, and I think most people are most familiar with, the acquisition of deepening of the voice, growth of muscle and bone, body hair, acquisition of libido and things like that. That's actually the second puberty that we all go through. Maybe would just mention for us and educate us on the first puberty. I think most people will be hearing this for the very first time. KYLE GILLETT: The first puberty of everyone's life is the first three months of their life. You may notice that your baby has more acne the first three months and that they also have, in general, just more changes related to androgens and estrogens, perhaps oilier skin, even more genitourinary-- genital growth during the first three months. And this is mostly due to DHEA, which is an adrenal hormone. The second puberty, or the puberty that most people know of, actually starts that same way as well. It's called adrenarche, and it's when the adrenals kick in, I guess, for the second time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is there a standard age or age range in which the testicles descend in males? KYLE GILLETT: Usually before birth. It is not uncommon to have one or even two undescended testes, but there is a risk of testicular cancer, especially if they are not fixed early and also heat damage to the teste. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, thank you for that coverage of the two puberties. So early in life. I imagine some of our listeners probably still in one or the-- well, one or the other puberty. The ones that are in the first puberty, obviously, aren't aware that they're listening to this podcast, but maybe it'll be embedded in their subconscious.

is the the foundational piece so the three big ones we've talked about one blood pressure so if your blood pressure is 120 over 80 or better that's important the second is not smoking so it turns out that smoking and blood pressure are both devastating for arteries uh but for different reasons right so smoking is devastating from a chemical perspective so it's completely irritating to the endothelium so the endothelium as you know is the Single Cell lining that is the innermost part of the arterial and arterial wall so this is a pretty special organ um again it's it's it's a bit naive but understandable that people just think of arteries as tubes um they're much more complicated than that they have many layers to them but this particular layer is unusually important it has an outsized importance because it is the one that's in contact with the luminal side right where the blood is flowing in the tube and anything that injures that has significant consequences so smoking is irritating to that in a chemical way and blood pressure is irritating to that in a mechanical way so th those two things basically you just want to that's the lwh hanging fruit in my world right you just don't want to have those things causing irritation the endothelium because that renders you now susceptible to the third factor which is apob bearing lipoproteins I want to talk about apob um in depth but as long as don't smoke is the second recommendation on the list uh can we better Define um smoking uh and what's being smoked so assume nicotine for um what about cannabis and what about vaping of nicotine and cannabis because vaping has become so much more common yeah it's a great question and it's sadly something we don't have a great answer for so I can certainly tell you that there's no reason to believe that smoking cannabis is somehow better than smoking cigarettes but the dose seems to be significantly lower in other words you know let's consider a person who smokes a pack a day for 20 years we call that a 20 pack year smoker someone who smokes two pack pack a day for 15 years is a 30 pack year smoker that's a person who's dramatically increased their risk of U many cancers including lung cancer and also their risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease again I'm not a I'm not a THC guy so I don't I can't necessarily speak for the habits of people that are smoking marijuana I can't imagine they're smoking that much probably not yeah so so while on a on a joint to cigarette basis they're probably equivalent in in terms of harm it I don't know let's say a person smokes a joint a day that would be like smoking a cigarette a day you know that's a 20th of a pack again I don't want to say that there's no downside to that but it it's it's probably significantly less so I don't I don't think the risk fully tracks I think the same is probably true for vaping and I I want to be clear like I don't think vaping is a good idea my my you know the last time I looked at the data on this it was surprisingly sparse but to me the only Advantage I could see to vaping was if it was the only way a person would stop smoking so there was you know I sort of looked at it as it was the definitely the lesser of two evils but the by far the better scenario was not to do any of these things if if nicotine is what you're after there are better ways to get nicotine for example through lozes and gum and things like that so that you shouldn't be turning to those things to to do it but but if it was like if gum is here and cigarettes are here you know vaping was probably here but boy I don't know for those listening uh uh Peter spaced his hands far apart for um gum and smoking and put vaping about a third of the way uh from gum uh toward uh smoking in other words vaping isn't good for you but it's not as bad as smoking that would be my that would be my I mean do you have a you've probably looked into this as well we did an episode on nicotine I did an episode on cannabis and um you know that the discussion around cannabis gets a little contentious for reasons that aren't um important it's kind of funny people the moment someone starts to confront cannabis as a potential Health harm people say it's not as nearly as bad as alcohol which is a crazy argument right getting hit by a boss isn't nearly as bad as getting hit by a motorcycle in most cases but sometimes you know so that's just kind of silly um and clearly cannabis has medical applications yeah clear clearly um and then it becomes an issue of the ratio of THC to CBD pure CBD forms actually been quite effective for the treatment of certain forms of epilepsy so called Charlotte's Web that's actually what it's called um very high THD containing cannabis clearly predisposes especially young males to later on set psychosis those data are starting to become clear clear enough to me anyway that people ought to be aware of them at least and maybe make decisions on the basis of those when it comes to the smoking versus vaping it's just very very very apparent that the chemical constituents of The Vape and what people are inhaling are terrible for people and are loaded with carcinogens and a bunch of other stuff many of which cross the bloodb brain barrier so that's what worries me the most you know obviously I'm not a clinician but anytime I hear about small molecules you know these small inorganic molecules getting across the blood being bar and then being maintained in neurons for many many years I worry because the experiment is ongoing mostly in young people so anyway without going too far down that track I I think if people can avoid smoking and vaping they should and as you mentioned there are other delivery devices for nicotine and cannabis tinctures and patches and uh gums and things that um Edibles that um if people choose to use those substances that can I I think sometimes people would benefit to to imagine what the surface area of the lung is right if you took the Alvar air sacs of the lungs and spread them out you would easily cover a tennis court remarkable so so just think about anytime you inhale something you are exposing your body is so Adept at absorbing it I mean we have this unbelievable system for gas exchange that was designed for gas exchange and anytime you're putting something else in that WG you're doing a really good job of getting it into your body so be mindful of what that is um and and that look that applies to to pollution too I mean the the PM 2.5 data is pretty good I I think once you so particulates that are less than 2.5 microns are are getting straight into the body um which is like a great argument for avoiding air pollution right I mean I I I always find it funny not to get off on this tangent but to me the most compelling arguments around cleaner energy have nothing to do with greenhouse gases they have to do with air pollution I promise you more people are dying from the part ulate matters in air that result from burning coal than are ever going to die from the CO2 emissions that result from that it's not it's and and and I would argue that's going to be two orders of magnitude it's not even in the same zip code makes sense during the fires which seem to follow me uh because when I was in Northern California there were a bunch of fires and we were constantly looking me wake up in the morning everything was covered with Ash uh my dog was having trouble breathing I was having trouble breathing everyone was suffering uh but but there are websites that one can go you can just look at air pollution and and we tend to only do this during fires then I'm you know when I'm in Southern California there tend to be fires here so um you know it's correlation not causation but um for sure I didn't set those fires folks but it's clear that it disrupts your breathing for a very long period of time but it's the long taale of that that we're really talking about here the very small particulate that we know firefighters for instance and certain um industrial workers can end up with that stuff embedded in their brain tissue for extremely long periods it's just not good um you make a really interesting point about um the the uh the call for cleaner energy um can we run that one up to to uh Washington or settle some of the debates about climate change just by getting straight to heal bypass all all the garbage that's um that's being spewed back and forth and just and basically get to the issue at hand right yeah just just just make it better for people to not die from the direct consequence I'd like to take a quick"}

"context": "probed the brain um the problem we can't learn a lot from those experiments now uh well in this way at least we don't know exactly where those electrodes were we didn't have MRI scanning or high quality cat scanning to to know where those electrodes were with certainty where and we know two or three millimeters matters and we also didn't have the tools to place electrodes in a precise way back then so unfortunately we can't learn a lot from those experiments right now so we're sort of redesigning them and there is a way to do it now um patients with epilepsy benefit from this all the time there has been a revolution in America it was in Europe before it was in America where we would do stereo encephalography which is basically like doing an EEG of patients with epilepsy but with invasive electrodes and we would Place tiny little wires less than a millimeter in diameter all throughout the brain into parts of the brain that we believe are involved in seizures and we would admit the patients to the hospital and figure out where the seizures were starting and propagating and then um you know we could stimulate these electrodes to see if there was a symptom that was important and I try to identify a region that we thought we could either remove surgically ablate with a laser or put a stimulator in it perhaps that's commonplace now for epilepsy um and it works extremely well and it's very safe of course it's still a brain procedure but the uh the complication rate is surprisingly low quite honestly for the amount of electors that we place um and it's extremely well tolerated most these patients leave the hospital and they don't even feel like they've had surgery so uh there's actually a lot of interest in using that procedure to study mental health disorders we are trying to do it for patients with obsessive compulsive disorder we're awaiting an FDA decision on that uh but actually I credit uh our colleagues at Baylor and at UCSF for for studying this uh already we have fabulous colleagues at UCSF that have studied depression using this type of approach a mutual friend of ours uh you know Eddie Chang who's a wonderful friend and colleague somebody I've emulated for many years as well uh and and the the Psychiatry team at UCSF have worked together on this sort of bringing together the epilepsy technique and the Psychiatry expertise to study how we could better Target electrodes in depression and I'll tell you if they have a consistent Target perhaps there becomes an ultrasound Target um but right now the approach is a bit more reversible because you can always shut that electrode off or even remove the electrode if perhaps it's not in the optimal location to treat the depression uh but actually after a large volume of cases perhaps they could pool that data to develop a a new ultrasound Target for depression I think that would be fabulous and probably is their long-term goal um not to speak for them but that would be something that I I'm sure is on their radar and a Baylor is trying to do the same thing for depression their approaches are a little bit different but a similar tool to try to understand uh depression and you know we're working with all these types of uh colleagues some of these are our friends to try to to bring this to OCD as well and you know it makes sense to try to do this for addiction and obesity and anorexia you might ask well why aren't you doing this for obesity right now in uh in our in our study and the reason is that um we've developed a target for obesity uh and binge eating disorder uh developed out of mice that we believe um is relevant for the human State because you can model this problem in a mouse a bit better than you can model depression or OCD so we feel like we can rely on the pre-clinical studies more whereas with these perhaps more I don't want to say more complicated but more human mental health conditions that are hard to model in a mouse you really have to study it in the human and you can perhaps start in an epileptic patient a patient that has electrodes and try to provoke a depressed state or study epileptics like Dr Chang has done that have comorbid depression for example and that can really validate this approach as well but in the end it's it's getting into the human brain that we need to do in the disease specifically that will eventually lead to a non invasive approach either a lesion or modulatory approach modulatory would be like TMS or lesion approach would be with ultrasound couldn't agree more meanwhile because there are many many millions of people suffering from depression Eating Disorders Parkinson's and essential tremor Etc well first of all I should say based on everything you've told me thus far it's amazing to me that any pharmacologic treatments work because of how systemic they are and impacting serotonin serotonergic neurons over here in dopaminergic neurons over there and not targeting any specific batch of cells it makes perfect sense as to why all the side effects exist but earlier you said something that really grabbed my attention I want to"}

Everything that happens before that is a topic of the next episode. But, sperm meets egg. This is mammalian reproduction. And that egg starts to duplicate, it starts to make more of itself. It makes more cells. And eventually some of those cells become skin. Some of those cells become brain. Some of those cells become muscle. Some of those cells become fingers. All the stuff that makes up the brain and body plan. In addition, there are hormones that come both from the mother and from the developing baby, the developing fetus. That impact. whether or not the brain will be what they call organized masculine or organized feminine. And as I say this, I want you to try and discard with the cultural connotations or your psychological connotations, of what masculinization and feminization are. Because we're only centering on the biology. So typically, people have either two X chromosomes, and the traditional language around that is that person is female, right? Or an X chromosome and a Y chromosome and that person will become male. Now it's not always the case. There are cases where it's XXY, where there two X chromosomes plus a Y chromosome. There are also cases where it's XYY. Where they're two Y chromosomes. and these have important biological and psychological impacts. So the first thing we need to establish is that there is something called chromosomal sex. Whether or not they're two X chromosomes, or an X and Y chromosome, is what we call chromosomal sex. But the next stage of separating out the sexes, is what we call gonadal sex. Typically not always, but typically if somebody has testes for their gonads, we think of them as male. And if somebody has ovaries, we think of them as female. Although that's not always the case either. But let's just explore the transition from chromosomal sex to gonadal sex, because it's a fascinating one that we all went through in some form or another. So this XY that we typically think of as promoting masculinization of the fetus. We say that because on the Y chromosome there are genes"}

So for people that are very driven, very motivated adopting a practice of being able to engage in the here and now the sort of almond type practices we talked about earlier of learning how to achieve a really good night's sleep on a regular basis through tools and mechanisms I talked about in previous podcasts gives us sort of balance to the pleasure seeking for an offsetting of pain and the pleasure in the here and now.

well then I should just take more anad and maybe I will age more slowly or I will replace some NAD that's missing as I age in whatever cell type turns out that might not be so straightforward right I mean I don't want to jump to supplementation just yet but if we are to back up from NAD a little bit and look at the pathway leading to NAD it's NR nmn and NAD we'll spell these out in a moment and the sort of competition that's out there in the market is around either infusing or in some cases ingesting NAD directly taking nmn which is the precursor to NAD orally I haven't heard of anybody infusing it or taking oral form NR which is the precursor to nmn my understanding is that nmn is simply NR minus a phosphate group yeah and and I'll take a step back from this first to say the following again let because this topic is so confusing I think it's just worth reminding everybody of what we now everything we've said and where it brings us right so I'm not going to repeat the whole ceran thing let's just leave that alone because everything we're on right now is Upstream of cin yeah it's basically like once you establish that we think cerin matter even though they don't work through caloric restriction and that's about the single most obvious thing I can say they might still matter even though we don't have things that we figured out can activate cerin like RIS veratrol we don't seem to have things that we can give you that activate cerin we're now on to the next part of the story which is okay cerin matter they don't seem to matter we think cin matter because of a few of these overexpression experiments um and we're making a big leap that because they mattered in yeast they're going to matter in us that's a huge leap for which there's zero evidence right and I'm only leaping further to this discussion about how to increase NAD because I know that's in the back of people's minds we're not we're not going to double click here just yet I just want to frame that up because ultimately ultimately that's where we are headed in terms of people making decisions as to whether or not they should take NR or take nmn NAD or none of the above and the reason I'm being such a hard ass about this Andrew is I spend so much time Fielding questions on this that I realize we just have to talk about this and excor it just in the most detailed fashion possible so that people understand why because it is just too easy right there's this great quote by JFK that I'm going to paraphrase that is basically people Ure you know enjoy the comfort of opinion without the discomfort of thought right so we need to sort of this is this is a podcast to get people to think and understand the entire history of this field so that they can actually make an informed decision about a supplement that I'm going to argue has very little scientific basis for its justification I I would say scientific justification for longevity I'll I'll go on record now saying that I take nmn and in some cases I will take NR and nmn and I observe this is just n of one self- observational data I observe a very clear positive effect but I don't think it has anything to do with extending lifespan and and we should talk about both Health span and lifespan benefits when we get to that part but we're so to bring us up to where we are now where you are with should people be supplementing NAD we're we're basically at the point where we're taking a lot of leaps of faith and saying because NAD levels are going down and Redux potential is going down we believe supplementing NAD in one form or another makes sense but before we do that we should acknowledge something yes NAD levels are going down but we have no reason to believe that raising NAD levels will correct a problem in other words if the body operates between this level and this level of NAD and if you go below this level you die and you go above this level you die and levels as you age go like this do we believe that raising them to this does anything we have there's no evidence that says it does so that's a leap of faith it's okay to take leaps of Faith you just have to know you're taking a leap of faith okay so leap of faith number one is the ceran thing leap of faith number two is the ceric Restriction thing leap of faith number three is this matters in our species the species of Interest leap of faith four is you know the whole uh ceran activator thing and now this leap of faith is if we just increase NAD levels in us it will produce a positive benefit okay so now how do how do we how do we do that now you get into the tactic okay there were three ways to do it as you said um one is you can intravenously take NAD by the way you could probably also orally take NAD it would just break down in the gut into its constitutive products um and then probably reform but for the purpose of how people actually do this they intravenously get NAD because it's not orally bioavailable or as you said they orally take two precursors NR and nmn my personal view on this is there's not really much of a difference in what you do in other words at the end of the day all of these things are generally going to increase NAD levels in the blood so a couple of um kind of practical notes I've taken NR in capsule form I've taken nmn typically in powdered form where I put it sublingually under the tongue my understanding is that have you done intravenous NAD I sure have and um and did you experience nasin flush no I I took NAD in a um as an infusion I probably done it five or six times and for the first 10 minutes of the infusion you feel like somebody stepping on your chest with a boot your legs cramp up you feel nauseous I did not take the anti-nausea Med that was offered I don't like taking things if I can avoid it I just figured I'll just experience this it was very uncomfortable MH to the point where you couldn't read a paper or a book you just you just want to be left alone you actually get a little bit irritable you're like this is awful you know every noise in the room is a bit too loud during that first 10 minutes and then by the way do you know how many people have said to me that because of that experience they know it must be doing something good oh my goodness to to which I'm like why don't you spread your legs let me kick you right in the nuts that's going to feel even worse is that doing something good like the fact that something feels so awful shouldn't be used as an explanation for why it's doing good physiologically right I don't know what it was doing physiologically except making me feel miserable during the infusion there are ways to adjust this even without the anti nausea meds for instance you can slow the infusion um that's the typical way people will put it in over the course of several hours anywhere from 3 hours to as brief as 30 minutes is kind of the record that I've heard about for 500 milligrams of NAD if you put 1,000 milligrams in there obviously it's more painful and you have to anyway there are a bunch of practical considerations you feel now maybe it's Placebo but one feels quite good afterward so as soon as the drip is done you feel better than you did prior to the drip how do you feel if you just receive an IV infusion of the same volume I've done that because I've received saline drips um you also feel pretty good yeah um it's hard to disentangle these things um and typically they'll put other things in the bag glutathione some vitamin C you know they tend to sell these as kits I just decided to try it it it seemed fine I did it when traveling I don't know maybe I'm due for another one soon but for me the more typical way to try and increase NAD or whatever because I don't know what it's doing exactly but I like the effects of taking sublingual nmn the single most let's say Salient to me uh anecdotal data on taking sublingual nmn is that it makes my hair grow really fast it makes my nails grow really fast and I do feel an increase in energy and I take it first thing in the morning morning um and what dose one and a half gram 1500 milligrams so by by the way if you translate you know the the doses that they give mice in the studies where they're testing the efficacy um are typically on the order of 500 to 1,000 milligrams per kilogram whoa yeah I'm 100 kilograms yep whoa okay so picture that the next time you're giving yourself some NAD or NR I'm not even approaching that yeah um at all well it's clear to me um based on my read of the data that NR can cross"}

Activity, Glycogen", "segment_idx": "5", "time_start": "19:48", "time_end": "25:08", "context": "healthy muscle we need to think about the feeding of that muscle the providing of nutrients to that muscle that is as well as the use of that muscle maybe let's start with the feeding or the providing of nutrients to that muscle you mentioned that muscle at rest mainly Burns fatty acids it can store glycogen how do we know when a muscle is full of glycogen I mean there's the the visual uh representation of the muscle seems Fuller as opposed to flatter um you know but these are um not specific um or these are not um precise terms you know how much carbohydrate does it take to fill all the muscle of the body with glycogen and then what sorts of things perhaps deplete that I think it's a great question we know that when we're talking about glycogen the the liver stores glycogen maybe 100 grams and then skeletal muscle depending on your size for example um you might store much more muscle glycogen whether it's four 500 grams compared to someone who is my size and can we do the the standard conversion of four calories per gram so if the liver is 400 gr you know we just say okay there's about 1,600 calories worth of yes of energy there so if I if I go out and I uh do some exercise and burn 1600 calories over time does that mean that the the liver is then completely depleted so well the liver will deplete in through an overnight fast so the liver's main the liver maintains blood glucose so skeletal muscle doesn't maintain blood glucose directly the way that you would leverage uh muscle glycogen would be through exercise the way in which you would deplete muscle glycogen would be through more um intensive exercise and when you think about the foods and the way in which you know your original question is how would we know how much muscle glycogen or how much we need to refuel I typically think about it as overall activity levels so if someone is sedentary then the current recommendation for carbohydrates would be 130 grams a day per day per day at four calories per gram at four calories per gram and is that um both simple and complex carbohydrates fibrous carbohydrates yes it would just be overall if they're completely sary so just a little bit of walking getting up going to the computer to the bathroom to the car Etc but basically sedentary and the average American takes in 300 grams of carbohydrates a day so more than double and as you can imagine this can distort metabolism when we think about glucose disposal the way in which I think about glucose disposal if an individual is sedentary is thinking about how many carbohydrates an individual can ingest at one time that would mitigate uh insulin response and would be able to be disposed of safely and that number is between 40 and 50 grams of carbohydrates at a meal outside of exercise the rest of carbohydrates would be earned through exercise and through every hour of exercise depending on the intensity that could be between 40 to 70 gram depending on how intense an individual ual exercises and that would be safely disposed of in a 2-hour period I mean when you think about an oral glucose tolerance test that's a 75 gram load you assume within two hours that that blood sugar regulation should come back to a normal range so at 40 to 50 grams of carbohydrate every two hours does that mean that if somebody were to eat 40 to 50 grams of carbohydrates every two hours which they shouldn't which they shouldn't but you're going to quickly exceed that 130 G per day and even if exercising with resistance training say hard for an hour um which you know can afford somebody maybe what another couple hundred 300 grams of carbohydrates probably not that much okay uh you know I I think that if people care about body composition which um I would say everyone should because you want to have an appropriate level of body fat and healthy skeletal muscle then you wouldn't NE necessarily unless you're doing some kind of cardiovascular activity you're not using a ton of of muscle glycogen depending on how much you're training and how much glycogen is the brain using so that is a that is a good question um the brain uses um a lot of carbohydrates that would be the a primary source when they come up with the numbers of 130 it's really based on brain and then the rest of the the body can we safely say that for somebody that's thinking a lot they need more carbohydrates um you could say that then your brain yes your brain is very metabolically active interesting so we're going of drawing rough estimates not knowing people's body weight not knowing their body composition but what I'm arriving at here is you know if somebody does a little bit of cardiovascular training maybe a little bit of light resistance training I'm describing the activities of many people out there maybe 250 gram of carbohydrates you're kind of at the threshold that's a lot that's that's a lot four four calories per gram um of those carbohydrates and so let's say 200 gram of carbohydrates per day um but that's not a ton of calories overall so what should the remainder of the calories be made up of so you know I"}

are on healthy individuals and they were in the studies so the um you know the study team took a uh well already monitoring the mature that there was no sudden weight loss or weight loss below um some safety level uh so those are very different from regular people who are who maybe even normal weight or even with uh within the healthy range if they do then they can potentially so that's why what we think is eight to ten hours maybe the ideal spot to begin with and um once you are physically active and you are also spending a lot of energy in physical activity or Sports you can even go up to 12 hours because in mice we have done that experiment um after 12 hours they do get a lot of benefits not all but so this is 12 hours of 12 hours of feeding 12 hours of fasting yeah um in humans um again nobody has done systematically 12 hours but there is one study in Europe um from tin High Colette lab and Tin high and I we collaborate so they used our my security and clock app this is a research app we developed just to this is mostly used in time restricted eating studies and he had nearly I think he started with 200 Swiss participants but then at the end he selected and took very small number of groups people who are very um meticulous about recording all their food and divided them into usual feeling whatever they wanted to eat whenever they wanted to eat and they were given the advice of Swiss nutrition advice that's given to improved health and reduce blood glucose almost like diabetes prevention program in the U.S and then the other group was given advice to eat within 12 hours this is very early on in time restorating and we thought that the mice were getting some benefit let's try with the 12 hours has any benefit the bottom line is at the end of three months and six months what he reported is both groups lost same amount of body weight and then there's not too much significant difference between groups but both groups actually improved their health so the bottom line is the Swiss nutritional advice that he was giving Which is the standard of care there it achieved the same amount of weight loss as just giving people this advice that eat within 12 hours so one way to look at it look at the result is like this and then he went to more extent and actually looked at every single meal these people consumed so they're close to I think close to 60 or 70 000 meal records and pictures he went through and then classified them to say whether these are good quality food so they call it the Nova classification one two three four one is the food that you can almost eat raw fruits vegetables um yogurt and dairy products that you can almost without any preparation and then second Nova 2 is kind of home home cooked food that most people will prepare in few minutes and then three and then fourth one is the food that you can never prepare at home so for example biscuit or cookies that we usually purchase and few other things and usually the Nova 4 are unhealthy Ultra processed food so which we should not be eating so the advice is to reduce Novak for and what I found was people who got all this advice um to improve their nutrition quality they actually improve their nutrition quality they reduce their Nova for food and people who were in time frustrating the eight within 12 hours they did not change the nutrition quality but what is interesting is they both got the same modest weight loss so that begs the question that in the maybe tin high will do this experiment again to combine nutrition advice with time restriction and maybe reduce the time to 10 hours and that might help um so 12 hours is something that I say anyone from five-year-old to 100 year old can do and if you are trying to maintain weight that might be a good way and combine that with exercise it'll be great and and people can more easily avoid Reds in that way women and for non-athletes or recreational exercises sounds like women if they distribute their calories across 12 hours are less likely to lose their menstrual cycle yeah so again this is something that we have to look carefully they have to be because we do have the my security and clock app that many people download and self-monitor and they share the data for researchers we won't provide a link to that by the way it's a great it's a great tool yeah but once in a while we do get this input from some women saying oh I started doing your Timeless routing and I I'm seeing all these problems and then I ask them okay so what else are you doing they're typically improve the nutrition quality so they're eating only salad and few and they're trying to increase the fiber intake and it's really hard to eat so much of uncooked food because cooking helps to absorb more nutrient and then at the same time they're running five miles every day and of course all of this combinedly can lead to Reds like symptom so that's why 12 I think is a good point if you're combining physical exercise and better nutrition quality because in mice also we have seen that if mice are eating healthy food and they're eating within 10 to 12 hours then they also live longer than mice that writing healthy food but Distributing that calorie over a long period of time and this is um Rafa di cabbage finding from NIH he has systematically done this study with two different types of diet and in mice and he finds the same thing that even mice that are eating within 12 hours they do live longer than mice that eat randomly even healthy food I I recall a recent study I think it was either published in cell reports or

I hate to break it to you but the reality is that if indeed resveratrol is good for us, and there's some debate about this, some people say strongly yes, some people say no, other people say maybe, the amount of red wine that one would have to drink in order to get enough resveratrol in order for it to be health promoting is so outrageously high that it would surely induce other negative effects that would offset the positive effects of resveratrol. So I wish I could tell you different. Again, I'm not here to be the bearer of bad news, but the statement I just made was confirmed by Dr. David Sinclair when he was a guest on this podcast. It's confirmed by other researchers who work on resveratrol and related pathways. I wish I could tell you that red wine is good for your health, and indeed it might be through some other mechanisms. So, for instance, there have been studies of low to moderate red wine consumption. This would be anywhere from one to four glasses per week. And I don't mean enormous glasses, I mean six-ounce glasses of red wine. And in those cases, some of the stress reduction that can be induced by consumption of red wine, maybe some of the other micronutrients and components within red wines, in particular red wines that come from particular grapes, and this gets really nuanced and, frankly, is not well worked out in the peer-reviewed literature or certainly not clinical trials, at least not that I'm aware of. Tell me if you're aware of a great clinical trial on this. Well, there may be some positive effects of that very low level of consumption. I'm not trying to take away anybody's red wine. I'm not trying to take away anybody's anything. I would be remiss, however, if I didn't tell you that resveratrol as the argument for drinking, and drinking red wine in particular, is just not a good one. It's just not supported by the peer-reviewed research. A few other things about alcohol and health."}

rushed me into surgery didn't know what was wrong with me I had some internal bleeding going on that's a long story wrote about it in another book point is during the surgery I regained conscious and sat up and looked at them operating on me which was surprising because I was lying down there and so I was like very disconcerted and I lay back down and I looked up between the surgical lights and between them appeared this ball of light that was much much much brighter than the surgical lights which are very bright and it was so beautiful I you just you can't describe it it's outside the cave and I was just completely obsessed by it and then it started to grow and when it touched me and it filled things it didn't bounce off things it filled them when it touched me this incredible joy and love and warmth flooded my body and I started to cry and my body was crying and the surgeons noticed these tears coming out of my eyes and they freaked out because they thought that I was feeling the surgery and crying was the only thing I could do about it so they were panicking and the anesthesiologist they told him you know bump up the medication later because I I grilled him later what did you give me what are the side effects what happens can I have some more um he he said afterward that when he went to increase the medication he said a voice said to him don't she's crying because she's happy and he said I just did what it said and he was white and shaking and he said did I do the right thing so I kind of told him a little of the story anyway this light was there wild yeah and I was just like home home home and it said yeah okay so this is this is what you really are and you're about to have a pretty tough time for a while um but just remember I'm always here even though you can't see me this and so I came out of that surgery and I thought I will not allow anything to my life that doesn't feel like that light oh that's what it it wasn't like it used language but it said this is not the way you feel after you die this is the way you're supposed to learn to feel all the time so in your body out of your body doesn't matter this is how you're meant to feel and believe me when I worked with heroin addicts they would describe their first high and it was as close to that as anything I'd heard people describe and I would say I believe you're meant to feel that way and also keep your teeth you know but um so I didn't tell a lie for a year I came out of it and Li I thought well lying is definitely not going to feel like that that light does not lie so no lies ever of any kind even the little micro like like when are you going to be home and you know it's 12 minutes and um and you say 10 can't say that say 12 do you like my my outfit no I do not I mean I found ways to I I would sort of try to soften the truth did it mean also telling every truth that was in your head you would keep certain things to yourself No in fact it felt untrue to say certain things to certain people it felt invasive or offensive and that didn't feel true sometimes silence was the greatest truth I could tell but I W I didn't even know that that was the case until I started my experiment so I did not lie for that year and I've done it many many times since but I would not recommend jumping into it 100% from a life that hasn't already been pretty examined what Anna has said and I think in the backdrop of what you're saying is that everybody does these little micro adjustments or um and you've said constantly and you've said that this is largely to smooth social interactions that most of lying is to smooth social interaction the research shows that most people lie at least three times within 10 minutes of meeting another person they lie to them and men are socially conditioned to tell lies that make them seem a little bit cooler than they maybe think they are for real and women people identified as women are socialized to tell lies that make other people feel good about themselves so it takes you in different directions um but I just wasn't going to tell any lie at all and let me just say that that year I it's not like I could say I lost these things but the fact is I dropped them I walked away from them my religion my uh with the religion went the family of origin um every friend I had growing up because to leave Mormonism is worse than murder in that Community I was cast into outer Darkness uh my marriage realized I was gay oops I hadn't figured that out at 29 came to you as a realization in that year yeah okay it must have been in your unconscious someplace prior there had never been there never been a like knock knock hey no I was so bent on being a good person according to my socialization the same way you were bent on being a a brave strong male according to the skateboarding culture I I would never have let that anywhere near my Consciousness and it had to be a series of experiences and my ex-husband was gay as well so um I'd known that about him for a while and so and I knew he was his best self when he was his gay self so that kind of helped but the marriage ended because of that um let's see what else happened oh oh yeah I quit Academia so my industry the thing I'd gone to all those years of school for my job means of support uh left my I was living in Utah at the time and I sort of fled for the border so I lost my home how were you feeling during this time better and better and better I think I expected you to be like it was horrible you're like no better and better it kind of was but not as horrible as staying in all those things and um the part that intrigues me um at the moment is like the losing of friends like losing of people and the structures that we relied on also for safety yeah that's got to be hard oh it's it's very yeah for the for parts of the psyche that are um you know very attached to socialization and and attached to people that are familiar to you it's heartbreaking really heartbreaking but that light gave me a full-on experience of the self and that I just I what it told me was it's always there my son who has Down syndrome one day told me um after his friend's mother died we're coming home from the funeral and he said I didn't cry and I said it's okay if you CED strong men cry and this is a sad time and he said it's not as hard after the light comes and opens your heart and he can barely talk and and so it was very garbled and I was like what a light came and opened your heart he said mhm I said when did this happen he said May 10th I was like this year no I was 13 wow and I was like you're holding out on me so this light had appeared in his room when he was having a really hard time kids with Down Syndrome don't have easy lives and it touched his heart and he said since then nothing was as hard and I said you know I saw it too and it said to me that it's always with us even though we can't see it and he said oh I can see it and I I was like you can and he was like yeah like he was sort of disappointed in me and I said well where is it is like up there down here in your head in your heart and he just looked at me and he said mom is everywhere he just sees the whole world illuminated and I think that's what I saw in the forest when suddenly the world would just turn to light it was that light so that was the field and as I lost each friendship as I lost each job as I faced the fear and the Heartbreak and everything those parts of me were dissolving and I was becoming more identified with that light and I that was the thing I was it was

{"question": "What are the effects of hormones on the brain and body, particularly in relation to neuromodulators such as dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine, and acetylcholine?", "doc_id": "T65RDBiB5Hs_8", "video_id": "T65RDBiB5Hs", "video_title": "Optimize & Control Your Brain Chemistry to Improve Health & Performance | Huberman Lab Podcast #80", "video_header": "Hormones Modulate Neuromodulators", "segment_idx": "8", "time_start": "42:15", "time_end": "52:10", "context": "directed effects of specific tools on neuromodulators, I'd like to just briefly mention hormones because they are also important for understanding the background and the context and these baseline levels of neuromodulators. Now here, I'm going to paint with a bit of a broad brush, but what I will say is accurate, even though it might not be exhaustive. What I mean by that is everything I'm about to say is true, but it doesn't cover every example in detail and nuanced possibility out there. Hormones have many different effects on the brain and body and not unlike neuromodulators, some of those effects are very fast. Some of them are very slow. In fact, certain hormones, for instance, the steroid hormones, like estrogen and like testosterone and corticosteroids and here, of course, I'm referring to the steroid hormones for what they are. They are indeed steroid hormones, but I'm not talking about steroids that people inject for sports performance or for physical augmentation. I'm talking about the steroid hormones that you make naturally because indeed you make these naturally. Well, the steroid hormones can actually control gene expression. They can change the identity of cells and the genes and proteins that cells express. This is why during puberty, for instance, testosterone and estrogen are released into the body, growth hormone is released into the body and bodies and voices and personalities and brains change tremendously because literally there is a transformation of the breast tissue, of the testicular tissue, of the ovarian tissue, of the bones, of the muscles, of the tissues and cells that control hair growth. Gene expression changes in all those cell types. And the child becomes an adolescent, becomes a young adult, right? That's what puberty really is. In fact, puberty is perhaps the most dramatic transformation that we go through in our entire lifespan in terms of our aging, 'cause indeed it reflects a very rapid, I should mention, period of aging and transformation of the identity of cells. So steroid hormones and other hormones can have very slow long-lasting actions in that way. They can also have very fast actions. So for instance, adrenaline, epinephrine, released from the adrenal glands can immediately make your heart beat faster, can immediately change the circumference of your blood vessels and arteries and capillaries and change the way blood flows. It can change the way you see the world, literally. It does change the way you see the world through your visual system. And that all happens on the order of hundreds of milliseconds or seconds, these are extremely fast actions. Corticosteroid also can have fast actions and slow actions. But since this isn't a discussion about hormones per se, and we've done entire episodes like the Optimize Testosterone and Estrogen episode. You can find that at HubermanLab.com. Or the interview with the incredibly knowledgeable and clear and really wonderful tutor of actionable information, Dr. Kyle Gillette, who is also on this podcast, you can learn a lot about hormones there. Today, we want to think about hormones as they relate to these neuromodulators, the dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine and acetylcholine, and in general, testosterone tends to collaborate with and increase the action of dopamine. That's not always the case, but in general, when testosterone goes up, dopamine goes up and sometimes even vice versa. When dopamine goes up, testosterone go up. And this is true for both males and for females. In general, when corticosteroids like cortisol and some related steroid hormones increase, epinephrine levels go up. And in general, when hormones like oxytocin or prolactin are increased, levels of serotonin go up. We can't draw a direct link between any one hormone system and acetylcholine. Acetylcholine kind of sits off in a category of its own in that way. But again, in general, testosterone and dopamine tend to collaborate in the same direction. Cortisol and epinephrine tend to collaborate in the same direction. Oxytocin and prolactin, which are hormones, and serotonin tend to collaborate in the same direction. And then we have poor old, lonely acetylcholine off on its own, but it's not poor and lonely. It actually has incredibly potent effects on its own. So it's really that it just doesn't mean much help from the hormone systems or at least not the steroid hormone systems in order to have its tremendous effects. Now a lot of what people think about and will do when trying to improve mental health and physical health is they will try and increase or decrease certain categories of hormones of the sort that I mentioned, testosterone, estrogen, oxytocin, and prolactin, so on. But oftentimes, the effects of those manipulations in hormones that are going to be most salient are not going to be due to the direct effects of those hormones. Sometimes it could be. But oftentimes it's going to be due to their effects on the brain and nervous system by way of how those hormones impact neuromodulators. So for instance, there are various things that people can do, both men and women, to increase their testosterone and estrogen in the appropriate ratios. I talked about one such approach in a previous episode, and that is to get sunlight onto a large portion of one's skin each day. Believe it or not, this actually works. And it works because your skin is actually an endocrine organ, a hormone secreting organ. It's a beautiful study. I've covered it on this podcast before. We will provide a link to this study again, but it had people spend at least 20 minutes or so, closer to 30 minutes, each day, trying to maximize sunlight exposure to as much of their skin as they could in terms of still maintaining decent exposure, meaning not over exposing themselves in a cultural way, meaning wearing enough clothes that they were decent, but still getting a lot of sun exposure, a couple of times per week or more. What they found was that people's testosterone and estrogen levels went up. Feelings of well-being went up. Feelings of well, or I should say increases in libido were observed, as well. They subjectively reported more passion, et cetera, testosterone and estrogen did indeed both go up. And again, I want to highlight that increases in estrogen, not just testosterone, are related to increases in libido in both men and women. This is why you never want to crush your estrogen down to zero, whether or not you're male or female, if you want to maintain some sort of healthy libido and general feelings of well-being, unrelated to libido. Well, many of those effects we know are not due to direct effects of testosterone and estrogen, but rather are due to the effects of testosterone and estrogen on the neuromodulators, dopamine and serotonin, because much of libido and feelings of well-being and feelings of relaxation, but also desire, motivation, et cetera, originate because of the activation of neural circuits that dopamine controls and promotes and that serotonin promote and control. So this is very important to understand as we move toward more specific discussion of the chemicals that we call neuromodulators, because hormones are controlling those neuromodulators in a very slow modulatory way. So yes, I said it, hormones modulate neuromodulators. I sort of said it twice on purpose. And this is a dramatic and potent effect. So I'll just give you one more example. The hormone prolactin tends to be antagonistic. It tends to reduce amounts of dopamine or at least when prolactin levels are high, dopamine levels tend to be lower. You observe this after the birth of a new child, you observe this post coitally after mating, in all species, humans and animals. When prolactin is elevated, serotonin tends to be elevated. And when prolactin is elevated, levels of dopamine and the effects of dopamine tend to subside. Now as I move toward explaining what each of the four categories of neuromodulators do, this will start to make more and more sense as to why this would be. I always say I wasn't consulted in the design phase, meaning I didn't design these circuits. And if anyone tells you that they did, you should back away quickly because none of us design these circuits. This is the way that evolution and nature created these systems. And they tend to work in a bit of a seesaw fashion, prolactin up, dopamine down, right? Dopamine up, prolactin down. In general, that is the way they work. So if we are to take a look at how each of these neuromodulator systems functions on its own, while understanding that they never truly function on their own, we can start to really make sense of the landscape of tools that are available to us and which tools are going to be most powerful to select if our goal is for instance, to be focused or if our goal is to be less stressed or if our goal is to be highly motivated and highly focused for sake of learning. All of that is indeed possible if you understand these four neuromodulators and you understand that while there are many tools ranging from pharmacologic to behavioral that can tap into these neuromodulator systems, that can kind of press on the gas of dopamine, pull back on serotonin and so on, but that there are particular tools, both behavioral and supplementation-based, and to some extent, prescription drug based, too, and we'll touch on a few of those. If you understand that and why they work, well, then you can create a sort of kit, a grab bag of things that you can use in any context or I should say that you can look to depending on the context you're in and create the states of body and mind that you want. Now once again, painting with a somewhat broad brush, but nonetheless, an accurate brush,"}
{"question": "How does spontaneous, non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) work, and can it be a significant contributor to weight loss and overall calorie burn?", "doc_id": "K4Ze-Sp6aUE_5", "video_id": "K4Ze-Sp6aUE", "video_title": "Dr. Layne Norton: The Science of Eating for Health, Fat Loss & Lean Muscle", "video_header": "Exercise & Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT)", "segment_idx": "5", "time_start": "19:05", "time_end": "25:44", "context": "So that's the TEF bucket and the BMR bucket. Then we go to physical activity. And physical activity is, essentially, two parts. There's exercise, which is kind of your purposeful movements like you go out for a walk, you do a training session. I mean, whatever. Any purposeful activity. And then you have what's called NEAT which is non-exercise activity thermogenesis, which I think is actually really cool. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's fascinating. LAYNE NORTON: Yeah. It is. So I was actually hanging out with somebody last night and I was noticing them, they were fidgeting their feet and their fingers. And I said, have you always been pretty lean? And they were like, yeah, I never really had a problem maintaining leanness. And when you look at the obese resistant phenotype, people think they have high BMR or they exercise a lot and really what it seems to be as neat. They tend to-- if they overeat, they just spontaneously increase their physical activity. Now, people get NEAT confused. I've heard people say, well, I'm going to go out for a walk to get my NEAT up. That's not NEAT. NEAT is not something you can consciously modify. What you're doing there, if it's purposeful, it's exercise. So for example, when I'm talking, if I'm waving around my hands, if I'm tapping my feet, if I'm-- whatever. That's NEAT. But trying to get yourself-- I'm just going to tap my foot more, well, now if I'm consciously having to do this, then my focus-- I mean, you know how the brain works. Very hard to do-- you don't really do two things at once. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. LAYNE NORTON: You switch quickly between tasks, right? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely. Can I quickly ask, was the person that you were referring to our friend Ben Bruno? LAYNE NORTON: No, no. But he is fidgety too. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Amazing online fitness channel. He's a freakishly strong individual. LAYNE NORTON: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. And I can't remember whether or not, Ben, you're a fidgetter or not. But anyway, I'll have to go check and we'll measure your fidgeting. About non-exercise induced thermogenesis NEAT, my understanding of the old papers on this, old being, I guess, back to the mid '90s, is that the calorie burn from NEAT is actually pretty significant. We're not talking about 100 calories or 200 calories per day. We're talking about, in some cases, hundreds of thousand-- excuse me, hundreds to maybe even close to 1,000 calories per day. Could you elaborate on that? LAYNE NORTON: Yeah. So there was actually a really classic study, I think, from-- I want to say it's from Levine in 1995. It was metabolic ward study. And hopefully, I don't butcher the study because I'm trying to pull it out of my brain. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I don't expect you to have that in your head. Although, I must say, you have a quite extensive PubMed ID, grab bag in there. So-- LAYNE NORTON: I try to bring the receipts. I try to bring the receipts. ANDREW HUBERMAN: We will put a link to this study in the show note captions. So people can peruse it if they like it, yeah. LAYNE NORTON: So I believe they had people overeat. And I think it was by like 1,000 calories a day and I think for six weeks. And I mean, this is the metabolic ward. So this is very tightly controlled. It's as tight as you get. And what was interesting is, of course, on average, people gained weight and gained fat mass. But some people gained more than expected, and there was one person, in particular, who only gained like just over 1/2 a kilo. They should have gained like-- I think it was something like 3 to 4 kilos. It was predicted. And what they found is this individual just spontaneously increased their physical activity. He didn't purposefully do it, it just happened. And I mean, anecdotally, I've seen people who are, again, very lean even eat a meal, sit down, and start sweating. And be very fidgety. There was a natural bodybuilder back in the day named Jim Cordova. And this guy was just very lean all the time, and he was exactly that phenotype. He would walk up a flight of stairs and all of a sudden he's sweating. Sit down eat a meal, he's sweating. He's just-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: He's a furnace. LAYNE NORTON: Just expending energy. And what's very interesting about NEAT is that seems to be the most modifiable-- I mean, exercise is very modifiable because you can be intentional with that. But of BMR, TEF, and NEAT, NEAT seems to be far more modifiable. So even a bodyweight reduction of 10%, they've observed a decrease in NEAT of almost 500 calories a day for a 10% reduction in body weight. Now, you also do get a decline in BMR when you lose weight, one, because you're just in a smaller body now and so it takes less energy to lock them out. But also there's what's called metabolic adaptation, which is a further reduction in your BMR than expected from the loss of body mass. And that's on average usually around like 15%. But it does seem to be-- there's new evidence coming out on the metabolic adaptation from BMR. And it seems to be a little bit-- kind of in the transition phases. So if you start a diet within the first few weeks, you will have a reduction in BMR that then just-- thereafter, any further reduction is mostly from the amount of body mass you lose. And then if you, like for example, finish a diet and move your calories to maintenance, within a few weeks, BMR starts to come back up. There is still a small reduction, but I used to be somebody who thought that BMR, metabolic adaptation was a big reason why people stopped losing weight or plateaued. And now, I think it's much more to do with NEAT. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting. And you said that it can't be conscious because that will distract us from other activities. I don't know if you've had a chance to look at this study. And I'll send it to you. Maybe I'd be fun to do a kind of an online journal club about this at some point soon. But there's a study that came out of University of Houston recently having people do, now, this is a long period of time. Four hours a day of, basically, a soleus pushup, which is basically a heel raise. A seated catchphrase with one foot not weighted. And then they looked at it a bunch of things about glucose metabolism and glucose clearance and insulin levels. And they didn't conclude that people burned a ton of calories, but what they concluded was that blood sugar regulation improved greatly. And I think, there was a lot of excitement about this at some level, but based on everything you're telling me, this fits perfectly with what's known about neat. So this fell somewhere in between with-- in between, excuse me, sort of deliberate exercise and spontaneous movement. I guess they've tried to make that spontaneous movement a little bit more conscious. LAYNE NORTON: Well, what I'll tell"}

{"question": "What are the key characteristics or indicators of a well-balanced generative drive, and how can it be distinguished from an overly aggressive or pleasure-driven drive?", "doc_id": "qPKd99Pa2iU_20", "video_id": "qPKd99Pa2iU", "video_title": "Dr. Paul Conti: How to Improve Your Mental Health | Huberman Lab Guest Series", "video_header": "Self-Reflection on Internal Drives; Envy", "segment_idx": "20", "time_start": "2:03:13", "time_end": "2:09:55", "context": "Oftentimes I hear that people are afraid of dealing with these deeper issues or addressing these deeper issues for fear that they'll lose, say, their drive. Right. The thing that makes them successful in the first place. And that allows them perhaps even to afford therapy or afford the time to think about these sorts of questions. So it seems to me that the drives that you referred to earlier, the generative drive, the aggressive drive, and the pleasure drive, are such critical nodes or areas to look for all of us in terms of figuring out whether or not we're doing well or less well according to some features that are pretty much universal in people. Essentially what I'm saying is, at least by my understanding, we all have drives to some extent or another. And to the extent that our aggressive drive is very high and pleasure drive is very high, and whether or not it's pointed in the right direction, it can be generative. If it's not, perhaps it can undermine our generative drive. I'm very curious to know how you've observed the different ranges of these drives in people and how that predicts whether or not people will do more or less well in different areas of life, essentially how the different drives play out. Paul Conti: I think that the first thing to say is where the drives are at, so to speak, in any of us is a combination of nature and nurture. So the nature part tells us the range, sort of that the drive is going to be. But because nurture means so much to humans, as we understand from epigenetics, from the advancement of science, we see more and more and more how much nurture matters. So the range that's denoted by nature is probably pretty broad. We see the manifestation of that, and then the nurture lets us then move that drive. Now, sometimes nurture, that's not gone in the right place can move the drive in the wrong direction. But as adults, as people who can take care of ourselves, who can learn about ourselves, we can change where the drives are seated. It's not an easy thing to do because it requires a lot of changes of self knowledge and hard work. But we can do it. We can change the sort of array of how those drives are manifesting themselves within us. And we see that, I mean, that's part of the hopefulness of mental health treatment, right? That we see not just surface changes, but we can see changes on a deeper level. So I think it's important that these things are not fixed. Although there are some natural elements. Someone who may have a natural sort of low aggression or low self assertion, okay, it's going to be in the lower range, but it doesn't mean that it's locked in at any one particular point. And that the place that we want to be, what is the place that's consistent with the things that we want, the agency and gratitude as verbs, and the sense of well being and all of that. So the idea is the state of health has the generative drive as prominent. It's the dominant drive, and then aggression and pleasure, which are still active in us, but they're subserving the generative drive, and that's the state that we wish to be in. So when we're assessing, okay, why is there something that doesn't feel okay or something that's not going okay, then? One way to start is to look at, okay, what's going on in the person, what may be off in the drives. That gives us a very strong idea of, okay, what's going on. A way of understanding what's going on as we then go and look in the ten cupboards to figure out the specifics, okay, what is actually going on here that we can then change, but the framing of what's going on can come through the lens of looking at the drives and how they're manifest in us. Andrew Huberman: What does it look like when the aggressive drive is very high and the pleasure drive is also very high? Paul Conti: So if these drives are running too high, where we end up at is in a place of envy and envy. I'm always sort of on the soapbox about envy, because I think envy is just so wildly destructive. And if the aggressive drive is very high, so the person say, in one way this can manifest itself, just wants more and more and more. They're not getting satisfaction from anything, but they want more. That may be because of a strong vulnerability inside of them. So something that might map to narcissism, for example. There could be a strong aggressive drive to get more, and that leads to something that's very unhealthy. So the idea that I want more, I need more, I don't have enough, I can't get enough, then fosters envy, which is not the desire to be better or to have more, but it's just the desire to feel better about the self, whether that involves raising the self up or bringing someone else down. That's why envy is destructive. So very high levels of aggression that are not tempered, for example, by a generative drive that would also be high, then create a circumstance of envy, and the envy is destructive. And the same happens if the pleasure drive is very, very strong. So if one continues to want more pleasure. So I can't find any satisfaction. I don't feel good about myself. I feel bereft inside. And I see that pleasure can make me feel better, but just for a little bit. Then it fades away and I want more of it, and I want more of it. That also can lead to the place of envy. Like that's the outcome. So if the aggressive drive is running very high, or the pleasure drive is running very high, or if both are running very high, but it only takes one in order to end up in a place of envy. So if the generative drive is not high enough to overcome how high the aggressive drive is, which would mean then the aggressive drive would be sublimated towards good, productive things. So take the energy and put it towards something that is goodness. But if the aggressive drive was way out there ahead of the generative drive, that ends up in a place of envy, as does the pleasure drive. If I want more and more and more, but I never get satisfaction from anything, it never brings me any sense of goodness that where it ends is in a place of vulnerability and resentment. Because envy involves wanting more. If we look at what's really going on, envy under the surface involves wanting everything, right? If a person is at the outer limits of envy, which is why envy is so destructive. Because if I can't get enough pleasure and there's so much aggression in me, then I'm not going to make myself feel better. But what I can do is make other people feel worse. Andrew Huberman: I want to ask you more about envy. But first I want to ask is one way to characterize the generative drive and"}

impact on working memory?", "doc_id": "HYVeP4F0GNU_10", "video_id": "HYVeP4F0GNU", "video_title": "Dr. Mark D'Esposito: How to Optimize Cognitive Function & Brain Health", "video_header": "Working Memory, Dopamine", "segment_idx": "10", "time_start": "44:42", "time_end": "52:58", "context": "working memory tasks and experiments in your laboratory if you would um be so kind as to explain what working memory is and then I'd love to talk about um some of the work you've done exploring the role of dopamine in working memory um because this is so critical to everyday life and I know dopamine's a bit of a buzzword these days but um the listeners of this podcast anyway are are um pretty sophisticated in terms of knowing that dopamine is not just about reward it's about motivation and goal directed behavior and I think dopamine intrigues for a good reason that it does govern a lot of our you know quality of life so um what's working memory yeah I mean working memory it's interesting I started studying at about 30 years ago and I don't think I realized how important it was when I started but what we mean by working memor is this ability to hold information in mind uh when it's no longer accessible to us so if you tell me your telephone number and I'm have to put it into my phone you know it's no longer there you just told me but I'll hold it in my working memory until I can punch it into my my phone it doesn't have to be something that comes from the outside world I could hold up uh you know I can pull up my own if I'm filling out a form and I want to pull up my social security number can hold that in mind too until I put it down so um when you think about it it's a very important uh you know ability that we have that we do very flawlessly and what I've learned more about working memory is is the working part of it it's not just this passive holding information on mind but it's being able to do things with the information it's being able to um you know when we when we do a bath problem which we don't do that much now that we have calculators but if you do that in your head you're able to sort of manipulate the information and and do the different parts of the problem or even if you're you know you're trying to find someone in a crowd and you're holding on to some face you're able to hold that face in mind and cross check it and search and and so there's there's operations to working memory it's not just you know it's not just this passive maintenance so when we start to think about working memory in that way we start to realize how important it is for it's you know I think of it as the foundation for for cognition just think about reading comprehension you can't understand this conversation if you can't hold in mind what's going on you know earlier in the in the conversation or when you're reading a book you know remembering the sentence uh before it so it just predicts all these abilities that that allows us to to read to to uh plan to organize and all the sort of executive functions that we're we're doing right we have to hold in mind rules we have to hold in mind goals we have to hold in mind all of these things in order to carry out behavior um you know so it's it's it's it's really come a long way in terms of how people are thinking about it I I I know that uh Matt Walker said that like you know sleep is our superpower but I guess one way to sort of use this term while we're awake working memory is is really our superpower because it it allows us to to translate as we said sort of our knowledge into action by holding this information uh in mind as we're thinking about what we want to do if we're going to think about dopamine in the context of working memory is dopamine an accelerator on working memory is it a facilitator I mean what is dopamine doing for working memory and maybe we could talk a little bit about the circuitry um I've talked about dopamine before on this podcast but there's a good chance that some of the people listening to this haven't heard those episodes so maybe we could just quickly review the three major circuits for dopamine and the one that's relevant for working memory yeah let me start with the working memory the circuitry for working memory because one one of the important things about working memory is the other type of memory is is long-term memory it's it's you you can working memory shortlived it's only as long as you're able to rehearse it and then it disappears whereas what we call long-term memory if I remembering what you had for breakfast or your vacation this is information that's gets Consolidated and and gets put into a a more durable form that we call long-term memory and the interesting thing about memory is that these are separate systems everything from working memory just doesn't pass into long-term memory there're they're two completely different systems and and two completely different parts of the brain that seem to control it um so working memory uh the frontal cortex seems to be very important for working memory when when we are holding information in line the neurons the brain cells in the frontal loes are active and they stay kind of active as long as we're holding on that information and they're more active when the information is relevant um and if we uh we we get distracted they'll get less active so it kind of the frontal Loops kind of track your uh you know track TR the memory that you're holding in mind another important thing about the circuitry is that um if we're holding in mind say digits you know the phone number well that information is in your back of the brain and so the the frontal loes is sort of keeping information in the back of the brain active because it's connected to the visual areas it's it's able to sort of keep that information active and so what what we've learned is that there's not these buffers in the brain where oh you know if you're holding verbal information it's in this little buffer if you're holding visual information it's in another buffer the whole brain acts as a buffer and and the frontal lobe can call up any part of the brain and keep that part of the brain active as it's as it's you know as it's trying to hold this information in line so the mechanism for working memory is just this persistent neural activity within the frontal LS and so then the question is what does dopamine do well dopamine is one of the neuromodulators that are made in the brain stem and IT projects up to different parts of the brain there's a system that goes up into the into the what we call the basil gangula which is important for motor function and there's another dope neric system that goes up to the frontal loes and what was discovered was that if you deplete DOP mean a working memory drops you get a significant impairment and working memory if if you deplete dopamine and if you replace it uh then your working memory will be improved and so DOP mean seems to be a modulator to help this persistent activity stay persistent consistent uh you know during the time that you need to keep this information in mind am I reaching to far to draw an analogy between dopamine's role in working memory that is to keep information online and the other established role of dopamine which is for movement for the generation of smooth movement um as evidenced by conditions like Parkinson's where people lack dopaminergic neurons or have damage to dopaminergic neurons and have a you know challenges in generating smooth movement what I'm essentially asking is can we think of dopamine as facilitating physical movement through one circuit but also kind of mental movement thought movement and um I'm thinking about for those just listening and and not watching I'm kind of rubbing my um index and middle finger against my thumb just keeping something online um it's sort of a movement of thought or information and then you kind of Chuck it away and bring about the next information is that is that yeah I think that's a good way of thinking about it and one might wonder well how can do me be important for memory but also be important for movement and and it's really simple it's just that it's acting on different circuits the the the neurons that go to the motor areas that carry dope mean will will when dope mean is expressed there then and boosted there then it will be involved in movement and lack of dope mean in the basil ganging will lead to neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease that has severe movement uh difficulty but when it's acting in the frontal cortex uh and expressed in the frontal cortex then it's going to improve working memory so it's just it's just a the nature of where the circuits are where the DOP mean is that's that's allowing it to have different kinds of actions and that's all for all transmitters the reason why OS choline seems to be more important for long-term memory is because it it's projecting to the hippocampus which is we know is another area that's important for memory and that's why asine doesn't boost your working memory but DOP mean does and vice versa I'd like to take a quick break to acknowledge our sponsor element"}

Salt has many, many important functions in the brain and body. For instance, it regulates fluid balance, how much fluid you desire and how much fluid you excrete. It also regulates your desire for salt itself, meaning your salt appetite. You have a homeostatically driven salt appetite. I'll talk about the mechanisms today, make them all very clear. What that means is that you crave salty things, beverages and foods, when your salt stores are low, and you tend to avoid salty beverages and foods when your salt stores are high, although that's not always the case. There are circumstances where you'll continue to crave salt even though you don't need salt or indeed even if you need to eliminate salt from your system. Salt also regulates your appetite for other nutrients, things like sugar, things like carbohydrates, and today, we'll explore all of that. Technically, salt is a mineral, and I should mention that when I say salt, I am indeed referring to sodium, in most cases, although I will be clear to distinguish salt from sodium, meaning table salt from sodium. Most people don't realize this, but one gram of table salt contains about 388 milligrams of sodium, so technically, we should be talking about sodium today and not salt. I will use them interchangeably unless I'm referring to some specific recommendations or ideas about trying to define your ideal salt, aka sodium intake, okay? So this is important. I think, right off the bat, a lot of people get themselves into a place of confusion and potentially even to a place of trouble by thinking that table salt in grams always equates to sodium in grams, and that's simply not the case. Today, we're going to explore the neural mechanisms by which we regulate our salt appetite and the way that the brain and body interact in the context of salt-seeking, salt avoidance, how to determine when we need more salt, when we need less salt. We'll talk about kidney function. We'll get into all of it, and we're going to do it very systematically,"}

can evoke a protein synthesis adaptation response but that adaptation response is lasts about 48 hours before it starts to taper off that the ideal in quotes frequency for training a given muscle group for hypertrophy is about every 48 hours is that true yes and no so a couple of things there remember in order to grow a muscle there's multiple steps here so you have the signaling response which actually happens within seconds of exercise and can last depending on the marker you know up to an hour or two hours step number two then is gene expression and we see that that's typically peaked around 2 to 6 hours post exercise and then you have following that protein synthesis and that's that longer time frame somewhere between 12 hours there it's certainly not peaked for 48 hours it may be still there 48 hours from now but it is is absolutely coming down at that point depending on sort of a number factors so that that part of is sort of TR so that this is a combination of like some half truths and some like maybe just pedantic things that aren't really that important to differentiate the real question I think is is like okay is it okay to train sooner slash is it better to train sooner or actually is it better to wait longer there's no real reason to think that you need to train if the goal is hypertrophy any sooner than 48 hours afterwards I can't think of an advantage that that would confer I also can't think of any practical applications athletes physique bodybuilders coaches that ever found tremendous success doing that so I would be very skeptical that that is any way better now could you do it in some instances of say you know you've got travel coming up like that so that you just yeah course you want to preload the system by destroying the musle no problem and then waiting seven days or 14 days I've known people have done that before Vacations or layoffs I every time like every single time to annihilate themselves and then take a two we layoff yeah and it's like there's no benefit there other than psychological like I just love it like it feels great to be super sore I feel less crappy not training for those couple days cuz I'm like I'm super sore anyways you need the extended rest yeah of course and it's just like it's just a crappy justification in my brain that like I excuse to do something really wild and that I totally don't need and get way sore than I should get Dr Andy Galvin suggestions of what not to do but that he does yeah 100% do as I say not as I do the famous words of every research Professor yeah I think 48 hours is a reasonable time uh to wait can't think of any advantage of going sooner than that there's really not a tremendous amount of advantage of waiting much longer than that certainly 72 hours is fine um as long as you're hitting these Concepts we've talked about you can let really life determine that um I mean there's situations too with with like particularly our athletes where we have to kind of break that because of schedule obligations they're playing every fifth day every third day or something like that you're just going to have to lift on back toback days you're just going to have to get it done um but yeah I can't think of why I would go out of my way to do that the second part of that question is let's say somebody trains a muscle they train it properly they hit it in the appropriate rep ranges and appropriate rest Etc that the stimulus is there the adaptation is set in motion they're getting somewhere somewhere at 48 hours or so a protein synthesis Peak that's going to taper off yeah but they don't train it 48 hours later or 72 hours later they train it five or six days later not because they're lazy not because they um they don't care but because they have other priorities that are woven in with getting hypertrophy in this muscle right there are people who exist only to get hypertrophy in a given muscle group but let's be fair most people would like to grow that muscle group but then does it necessarily mean that the muscle starts to revert to its prehypertrophic state that is does it atrophy and get smaller again because if it doesn't I could see a lot of reasons for hitting a muscle group once every five 5 days or seven days provided you hold on to the hypertrophy that you initiated 5 or seven days ago yeah there's no reason to think you would lose anything in that sort of a Time domain five to seven days the only challenge with training that infrequently is can you actually get enough total volume done so if you're going to train a muscle once a week you either have to go to real failure real damage and soreness or you have to figure out a way to hit 20 sets that day in that muscle not at all impossible especially if you're thinking well actually all I have to hit is and I'm going to do five sets of three exercises that's not outrageous not at all so so like absolutely possible if you're wanting to go more towards 20 or getting closer to that 25 like now it starts to get pretty challenging so um scientifically the research will suggest it's going to be equally effective practically it's challenging for people to hit sufficient volume without just being so demoralized afterwards because they're in so much pain they can't get out of their car cuz their legs are so trash they can't sit on the toilet get back up without crying um from pain so that's not good no that's not good I say that cuz those are actual examples that have happened in my life yeah I I realizing as we're having this conversation about ways to stimulate hypertrophy that I've sort of defaulted to more intensity as opposed to volume because of the time factor I have a lot of other things going on in my life and So within that hour I Can't Get Enough sets in across all the muscle groups I need to hit and I'm only going to do it about once a week and so it's at least for me more advantageous to just train extremely hard I actually use the pre-exhaustion technique that you mentioned before yep or pref fatigue as you referred to it of hitting something really strong with an isolation exercise then doing compound exercises I'm starting to think based on what you've told me that pre fatigue and then a compound exercise in some ways it's not really two sets because if you're going to failure for straps you're kind of pushing past failure then you're doing a compound exercise and you're doing that two or three times well that sounds like four to six sets but the force repetitions are almost like an additional set right and so it's not 20 sets but it's four to six really really hard sets that go beyond what we normally think of as a set totally okay it's sort of the difference between running on concrete and running on Sand when I go for a sand run it's a very different experience totally yep and this is why uh I should have mentioned this at the very very beginning of our our chat today but all of these numbers that I'll give you for any exercise adaptation you you you cannot think of them as hard lines they are gradients and so when we think about the number for hypert trvy in terms of repetitions I said four to 30 what do you think happens at three do you think hyper just stops right in fact the number you'll see in the literature is more like six to 30 I actually slide it down to four though like personal preference because of that but it just Fades away what do you think happens at rep 31 35 there's it just Fades gradually over over time so you actually sort of brought this up one of your earlier questions and I'm not sure if you were even thinking about this or maybe you were I just babbled on about something else but if strength happens between this like one to five repetition range and hypertrophy typically happens in this like eight to 30 range what happens if I were to do to sets of six or God forbid seven like seven and nine are these numbers you just absolutely don't do in strength training right just like set of 1 2 3 4 5 6 got 8 10 12 like do not program a set of 13 when I'm training sets of seven to nine yeah it's great right uh we'll use sets of seven a lot um with weightlifters because you can actually count numbers more effectively B but what happens in seven to n rep so this is actually wonderful area of these like five to eight repetitions where you're going to get a nice combination of a lot of strength gains and a lot of hypertrophy so someone who's coming in going man I want to get stronger and I want to add muscle what do I do here well that's actually a really nice answer train pretty hard in that like four to eight repetition range and you're going to get a lot stronger and you'll still induce a lot of hypertrophy if you want to really maximize hypertrophy I would probably spend most of your time in the 8 to 15 repetition per set range you can go up to 30 admittedly though I don't think it's optimal to spend most of your time at more than 15 reps per set it's very challenging to maintain the focus required at rep 27 to actually get sufficient failure by rep you just you just give up way too early it's hard to do the same thing at the bottom end of that Spectrum in terms of of really heavy to get there so I really honestly think 8 to 15 is still it's cliche it's that textbook number but it's a reason that's a textbook it is tried and true and very very very effective if for instance you want to get stronger though and not invoke a lot of hypertrophy you have a couple of tricks you can pull number one stay south of that five repetition range you do sets of one sets of two go as heavy as you can um with all appropriate considerations and stick within maybe even up to three reps per set you start getting to four to five to six now you're going to start itching towards that that hypertrophy range so stay down there do a lot more total sets so do a classic example would be something like eight sets of three right you're going to get a lot of practice you're going to get 24 very high quality reps with a lot of rest in between okay you go from there you go to managing caloric intake making sure your protein is still on point you want to recover but if your total calories aren't um you know greater than 10 to 15% above your maintenance needs then you're not going to be able to put on a whole bunch of muscle mass because you just don't have the fuel for it you can also then space your workouts out so that stimulus isn't coming uh extremely often so if you do that thing a couple of times a week it's not enough frequency in that signal so remember that signal has to be frequent or loud you didn't make it super loud and now you're not making it super frequent you can can get very very very strong like that and and put on very low amounts of hyper if that's sort of the choice so you told us a lot about volume"}

There is something called representational plasticity. Representational plasticity is just your internal representation of the outside world. So you have a map of auditory space, believe it or not, meaning you have neurons that respond when something over on my right happens, like I'm snapping my fingers over to my right. I can't snap as well on my left, which is the whole thing unto itself. [snaps fingers] Yeah, weak over there on the left side. But when I do that, there are different neurons respond to those. We have a map of visual space. Certain neurons are seeing things in certain portions of visual space and not others. We have a map of motor space, meaning when we move our limbs in particular directions, we know where those limbs are because even if we can't see them, we have what's called proprioceptive feedback. So we have knowledge about where our limbs are. In fact, people that lack certain neurons for proprioceptive feedback, they are very poor at controlling their motor behavior. They get injured a lot. It's actually a terrible situation. So we've got all these representations inside and we have maps of our motor commands. We know that, for instance, if I want to reach out and grab the pen in front of me, that I need to generate a certain amount of force. So I rarely overshoot, I rarely miss the pen. Our maps of the motor world and our maps of the sensory world are merged. The way to create plasticity is to create mismatches or errors in how we perform things. And this I think is an amazing and important feature of neuroplasticity that is highly underappreciated. The way to create plasticity is to send signals to the brain that something is wrong,"}
{"question": "How does the ghrelin hormone pathway, which is triggered by fasting and stimulates feelings of hunger, impact neural circuits in the brain to drive eating behavior?", "doc_id": "15R2pMqU2ok_7", "video_id": "15R2pMqU2ok", "video_title": "How to Enhance Your Gut Microbiome for Brain & Overall Health", "video_header": "Ghrelin: Slow Modulation of Your Brain in Hunger", "segment_idx": "7", "time_start": "34:14", "time_end": "37:58", "context": "Here I'm talking about a particular type of neuron that is signaling up to the brain using electrical signals to cause us to want to seek out a particular category of foods. That's happening relatively fast compared to the hormone pathways of the gut which also involve neurons. So your gut is also communicating to your brain by way of neurons, nerve cells. But some of those nerve cells also release hormones. And those hormones go by names like CCK, glucagon-like peptide 1, PYY, et cetera. A good example of a hormone pathway, or what's sometimes called a hormone peptide pathway, that is similar to the pathway I've talked about before but a little bit slower is the ghrelin pathway. Ghrelin, G-H-R-E-L-I-N, increases with fasting. So the longer it's been since you've eaten, or if you're just eating very little food compared to your caloric needs, ghrelin levels are going to go up in your bloodstream and they go up because of processes that include processes within the gut and include the nervous system. So it's a slow pathway driving you to seek out food generally. As far as we know, the ghrelin system is not partial to seeking out of sweet foods or fatty foods or so on. Ghrelin increases the longer it's been since you've eaten sufficient calories and it stimulates a feeling of you wanting to seek out food. Well, how does it do that? It does that again by impacting neural circuits within the brain, neural circuits that include what we call the brain stem autonomic center. So it tends to make you feel alert and quite, we say, high levels of autonomic arousal. If you haven't eaten in a while, you might think that you just get really exhausted, right? Because we all hear that food is energy and caloric energy is what we need to burn, but you actually have a lot of energy stored in your body that you would be able to use if you really needed energy. But typically if we haven't eaten in a while, we start to get agitated and we get agitated by way way of release of the neuromodulator epinephrine, which causes us to look around more, move around more, and seek out food. That all occurs in brain stem autonomic centers and in the hypothalamus. We did an entire episode on feeding behavior and metabolism as well and you can find those episodes at hubermanlab.com so I don't want to go into a lot of detail about hypothalamic and brains stem centers. But there's a particular area of the brain called the nucleus of the solitary tract, the NST as it's called, that's very strongly impacted by these circulating hormones and tends to drive us toward feeding behavior. So the important point here is that we have a fast system that is paying attention to the nutrients in our gut or the absence of nutrients in our gut, and stimulating us to seek out food or to stop eating certain foods, and we have a slower hormone-related system that also originates in the gut and impacts the brain. But all of those converge on neural circuits for feeding. The neural circuits for feeding include things like the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, they include a bunch of other neurochemicals, but the point is that you've got a fast route and a slow route to drive you to eat more or eat less, right, to seek out food and consume it or to stop eating, to essentially kickstart the satiety mechanisms as they're called, and those are operating in parallel. It's not like one happens first then stops then the other. They're always operating in parallel. And I bring this up because there's a bigger theme here which we see over and over again in biology, which is the concept of parallel pathways. You've always got multiple accelerators and multiple brakes on a system. It's very, very rare to have just one accelerator and one brake on the system. And this will become important later when we talk about tools for optimizing your gut microbiome for healthy eating and for health healthy digestion and for healthy brain function.

{"question": "What is a physiological sigh and how can it be used to alleviate side cramps during exercise?", "doc_id": "x4m_PdFbu-s_14", "video_id": "x4m_PdFbu-s", "video_title": "How to Breathe Correctly for Optimal Health, Mood, Learning & Performance | Huberman Lab Podcast", "video_header": "Tool: Physiological Sighing & Exercise Side Cramp", "segment_idx": "14", "time_start": "1:33:57", "time_end": "1:39:12", "context": "And even though carbon dioxide is essential for life, you don't want too much of it in your system. And that people, whether or not they were asleep or awake, would engage a physiological sigh spontaneously, subconsciously. They would do this double inhale through the nose and extended exhale through the mouth. And that did not just eliminate excessive carbon dioxide from the system. It also rebalanced the oxygen-carbon dioxide ratio in the proper ways. In fact, it's observed in animals. You might see this in animals that are tired. When animals or humans get tired, they tend to start underbreathing a little bit, and that can often disrupt the balance of carbon dioxide and oxygen. And right before a dog will go down for a nap, for instance, you'll notice that it'll do this double inhale, exhale. people when they are sleeping, if they hold their breath for a period of time, which, frankly, all of us do periodically throughout sleep, they will engage a spontaneous physiological sigh. During the daytime, we are often holding our breath, especially nowadays-- and there's a study on this that we'll talk about a little bit later-- where when people text message or they're emailing, although nowadays people are mainly on social media and text messaging, they often are holding their breath. They will follow a breath hold by a physiological sigh because during that breath hold, they're building up the level of carbon dioxide in their system. Now, mind you, I spent close to a half an hour telling you that most people are overbreathing at rest, and that's also true. But people often will shift from overbreathing to underbreathing, which is a terrible pattern. So physiological sighs done either as a one-off, one physiological sigh to clamp stress or reduce stress in real time, or repeatedly over five minutes as a practice that you do each day is going to be not just the most effective way to approach reducing stress around the clock and in real time but also the one that's highly compatible with the way that the neural circuits that control breathing were designed. The physiological sigh has some other very useful applications. One of the more, I would say, useful ones, at least to those of you that exercise, is going to be the use of physiological sigh in order to remove the so-called side stitch. So if you've ever been running or swimming or exercising and you felt a cramp on your right side, chances are, despite what your high school PE coach told you, that raising your arms above your head or drinking less water before you exercise is not going to get rid of that cramp. And here's why. It's not a cramp at all. If you recall the cervical 3, 4, and 5 nerves that give rise to the phrenic nerve and go down and innervate your diaphragm, well, as I mentioned before, a certain number of those nerve fibers actually course into the diaphragm and go up underneath. And if you recall earlier, I also said that the diaphragm sits right on top of the liver. In other words, you actually have a sensory innervation of the diaphragm, the deep diaphragm, and the liver. And there's something called referenced pain, which is what people generally experience when they have that side stitch on their right-hand side. So if you're ever exercising and you feel a cramp on your right-hand side, it's possible that it's a genuine cramp. But more likely is the fact that that phrenic nerve sensory innervation is now being carried up to your brain and you are detecting some local or referenced pain in the liver and in the diaphragm. Now, that doesn't necessarily mean you're doing anything wrong, although you might not be breathing properly for running at that moment, and that's what gave rise to it. It could be some spasming of the phrenic nerve or some inefficient breathing during running. We had an entire series on fitness with Dr. Andy Galpin. One of those episodes included a lot of information on breathing. It was the episode on endurance, although breathing was a topic that was thread through multiple episodes in that series. You can find that series at HubermanLab.com. Talks a lot about how to breathe during running, how to breathe during weightlifting, et cetera. But the point for now is that if ever you're experiencing that right-side side stitch, I encourage you to perform the physiological sigh. And the good news is you can perform it while still running or while still swimming, although I suppose with swimming, you might have to make some adjustments because, of course, you don't want to inhale water, or while cycling or any type of activity. If you perform that physiological sigh generally two or three times, what will occur is that because of changes in the firing of the phrenic nerve, and in particular because of changes in the sensory feedback from the sensory component of the phrenic nerve back to the brain, you will experience an alleviation of the pain from that right-side side stitch. In other words, you can get rid of side cramps doing physiological sighs during activities, in particular during running activities. Now, I should also mention that if you're experiencing a side stitch on the left-side, chances are that has to do with excessive air or fluid in your stomach. And there are reasons for that that also have to do with the way that the phrenic nerve is-- it's bilateral and branches to both sides and is catching sensory input on the left side from some of the local organs and sensory innervation of those organs. But if you have right-side side stitch, the physiological sigh done two or three times while still running ought to relieve that side stitch. Now, as long as we're talking about breathing and the phrenic nerve and the relationship between the phrenic nerve and your liver and your stomach and some of the other organs in that neighborhood, we should talk about the relationship between breathing and heart rate."}

I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a Professor of Neurobiology and Ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is Dr. Oded Rechavi. Dr. Oded Rechavi is a Professor of Neurobiology at Tel Aviv University in Israel. His laboratory studies genetic inheritance. Now, everybody is familiar with genetic inheritance as the idea that we inherit genes from our parents, and indeed, that is true. Many people are also probably now aware of the so called epigenome, that is, ways in which our environment and experiences can change our genome and therefore the genes that we inherit or pass on to our children. What is less known, however, and what is discussed today, is the evidence that we can actually pass on traits that relate to our experiences. That's right. There is evidence in worms, in flies, in mice, and indeed in human beings, that memories can indeed be passed from one generation to the next. And that turns out to be just the tip of the iceberg in terms of how our parents' experiences, and our experiences can be passed on from one generation to the next, both in terms of modifying the biological circuits of the brain and body and the psychological consequences of those biological changes. During today's episode, Dr. Rejave gives us a beautiful description of how genetics work. So even if you don't have a background in biology or science, by the end of today's episode, you will understand the core elements of genetics and the genetic passage of traits from one generation to the next. In addition, he makes it clear how certain experiences can indeed modify our genes such that they are passed from our parents to us, and even transgenerationally across multi generations. That is, one generation could experience something, and their grandchildren would still have genetic modifications that reflect those prior experiences of their grandparents. Dr. Rechavi takes us on an incredible journey explaining how our genes and different patterns of inheritance shape our experience of life and who we are.

interesting I really value my relationships you said that okay that's one value and I think this is I'm G to ask you this question do you value quick responses all the time from you on text message is that a value of yours from me or to me from you do I value always responding to people on text right away the truth is if I'm really honest yeah I hate um shallow exchange of any kind except maybe a fist bump to somebody you just kind of feel some kinship with on the street and you have that connect and you just give them the fist bump great but I like more in-depth lengthy connection like three-h hour long conversation three hour long conversations or drop a friend came by the other day for um New Year's he was on my list of people that and yes I made a list of people that I want to deep in my friendship with in the in the New Year came by we had a 2hour lunch we chatted and and I feel like it was awesome and worth a million single line text messages and I'm also the kind of person where like I'm good to not see him for a while not because I'm tired of him but because I also have other friends and things to do right so I'm more of a depth not breadth kind of guy this is to me this is such a powerful process and then after this I kind of want to link it back to how I've actually told my kids about why I do go out to dinner with friends right so you're like I value deep relationships I value relationships I value deep relationship but and with I'm if I'm honest with myself responding to someone right away that's actually not my value but again we can hold multiple things at once that doesn't mean I don't care about those people I just laid out all my values what I think is so powerful as a not guilt diffuser is naming this directly to the people so doesn't have to be on text but you're see person X and you know I'm never that good I just want to tell you I I really value our friendship I really value these times we have together something I just also want to get off my chest is going back and forth quickly on text that's not something that's easy for me that I do very often and so you might text me and it might take me a while and I I just wanted to name that to you right now look someone else always has the right to say well that's interesting that doesn't work for me one of my top values with friends is someone who's always getting back and forth to me that's actually great great now we know okay what are we going to do about that that's fine you know where someone stands and the reason I relate this to the situation with going to dinner is I remember early on when my daughter said why do you have to go to dinner with friends or why do you and Dad this was it why do you and Dad go to dinner without us I know the couple you're going out with you both have kids why can't you bring us right and this is where we say we feel guilt but we don't cuz I'm like time out she's feeling this feeling not me and also I don't need her permission or approval that's the real parentified thing we like go to our seven-year-old and we're like don't you want me to have adult conversations again not it's not an atypical response I've heard parents do that like don't you want me to have a social life but you know what it is it is asking your kid to do your job for you again can you imagine a pilot say do you think we should make it an emergency landing it you'd be that's how a kid feels when they're asked that they're like why are you asking me that here's what I said to my daughter in that situation I really did I want to tell you something I love being your mom I I really do it's one of the most important things in my life I also really like being married to dad and I really like the times we have when it's just us and other adults that's really important I remember saying this maybe I was really trying to Double Down we actually we we had that before you guys were here you like what yeah um and so one of the reasons I want to be honest with you why do we go to dinner without you it's not so much we go to dinner without you we think of it as going to dinner with each other and just adults is that something we really enjoy it's really important to us it's a really important part of us and that's why like being really vocal about your values as opposed to looking to your child unconsciously to give you permission to have those values if you want to use power that's a power that's a power move and it's amazing this is true in any time in life the more you can locate someone the more you respect their boundaries I I use that word a lot and know like locate I'm sure you know people in your life like can I locate them you kind of know who they are you know what they value and you respect them right when you can't locate someone you feel very uneasy around them you're kind of like where are you who are you what do you stand for and as you can see with my daughter it was a I wasn't saying something mean I I was saying something true and so I think with the friendships and when you say is this guilty it's like well maybe my step and my action is just actually being honest with this person I'm not very good at responding right away I want to let you know I deeply care about our friendship I'm not very good at responding to kind of small talk over text and I just wanted to let you know that so you didn't misinterpret it like I I wonder what would happen I wonder if people would kind of respond really positively I love it and I I can't help"}

Of course I think molecules like dopamine craving, there's a book even called the molecule of more, et cetera. Dopamine is a very diabolical molecule, as you know, because it evokes both a sense of pleasure-ish, but also a sense of desiring more, of craving. So if I understand you correctly, artificial sweeteners are, and I agree are failing as a means to satisfy sugar craving at the level of nutrient sensing. And yet if we trigger this true sugar evoked wanting pathway too much, and we've all experienced this, then we eat sugar and we find ourselves wanting more and more sugar. Now that could also be insulin dysregulation, but can we uncouple those? - I mean, look, if we have a mega problem with over consumption of sugar and fat, we're facing a unique time in our evolution where diseases of malnutrition are due to over-nutrition. I mean, how nuts is that? Historically, diseases of malnutrition have always been linked to undernutrition. And so we need to come up with strategies that can meaningfully change the activation of these circuits that control our wanting certainly in the populations at risk, and this gut brain circuit that ultimately it's the lines of communication that are informing the brain, the presence of intestinal sugar, in this example, it's a very important target in the way we think about, is there a way that we can meaningfully modulate these circuits? So I make your brain think that you got satisfied with sugar, even though I'm not giving you sugar. - So that immediately raises the question are the receptors for glucose in these gut cells susceptible to other things that are healthier for us. - That's very good. Excellent idea. And I think an important goal will be to come up with a strategy and identify those very means that allow us to modulate the circuits in a way that certainly for all of those, where this is a big issue, it can really have a, you know, dramatic impact in improving human health. - I could be wrong about this.

Okay, so for those of you listening who have not yet gone and accessed the PDF that we've put in the show note captions. You can do that at any point, but what we're talking about is a bunch of things down at the bottom under these two pillars, structure of self and function of self. These cupboards that are extremely valuable for any and all of us to look in and explore and ask specific questions, because it's what resides within those cupboards that combine in a sort of recipe and then geyser up into whether or not and how much empowerment, humility, agency, gratitude, peace, contentment, delight, and generative drive we are able to exert and experience for ourselves in life. So imagine in your minds, if you will, and here I'm borrowing directly from a picture model that Dr. Conti provided before the filming of this series, which is an iceberg where below the surface of the water resides a bunch of stuff. And then a little bit is above the water. And maybe you'll help us revisit that model now for a few moments. But if you take nothing away at this moment, please understand that there's a lot of complex stuff going on underneath the surface of the brain and mind. But a key feature of this map is that while it is very, very complex underneath, what emerges from that complexity gets simpler and simpler, especially as we move towards places of better health and more effectiveness in life. So if you would, could you describe the map in a bit more detail, especially what's down there in these pillars, the complex stuff and the stuff that we should be looking at. And then we'll touch on some of those cupboards that we all have and the sorts of questions that we should all be asking in the context of some common challenges, but also some very common and very effective paths to doing and feeling better. Paul Conti: Yes, the unconscious mind is the place to start. That's the deepest level of the structure of self. So imagine sitting on top of a biological supercomputer the size of a house. That's what's going on inside of us. The unconscious mind is that biological supercomputer. And if we're interested in ourselves, we become very, very curious about what is going on in it. And that's where, even though it's not directly accessible to us, it can be accessible through other ways, such as we talked about reflection or therapy. And of course, there are other ways too, but it is accessible to us, and we want to know what is in it, because what is in it has such a strong effect on what's going on in our conscious mind. That's the person on top of the biological supercomputer, the size of a house or the image we've been using is the top of the iceberg that's coming out of the water. So we can look at that either way. But what is in it has, of course, a huge effect on the part that we're aware of, our conscious mind. And I think the best analogy here, and it's actually, I think, quite an analogy that parallels very well, is to an abscess in the field of physical medicine. So an abscess is an area of walled-off infection. So imagine that there's some infection, for example, it's often in the abdomen, there's some infection, and that infection could be really dangerous. If that infection spread, boy, it could go to the blood, the person could die from that, right? So the body does a really good job of walling off that infection. And that's a good thing, right? Because if the infection weren't walled off, it poses huge risk. But the walled-off infection does not represent a condition of health. So someone who has an abscess in them and doesn't know it. This happens frequently in medicine, and we see people coming to emergency rooms, and they have a low grade fever, and they've had a low grade fever for a while, and they just don't feel good, and they have low energy, and they're not sleeping well, and they find themselves sweating a lot. There are pervasive experiences going on that are really detracting from life. Like not feeling great all the time, even though the person doesn't feel really sick. That's sometimes why it takes a while for the person to come to medical attention. So what's going on is better than not being walled off. But it is not synonymous with health. So what happens in physical medicine? Abscess is identified, and then someone goes in. The surgeon goes in and drains it, and then the person is better. Now, think about that process. Like surgery. Surgery is not a fun thing. Right? There's anesthesia, there's recovery. But surgery is great when it cures the problem. Andrew Huberman: Right. Paul Conti: So it's not that, oh, the physician in the emergency room or the family practice doc identifies that there's an abscess, refer to the surgeon, everything is great and happy, and they're better. No, they have to go have a surgery, and that's not an easy thing. Andrew Huberman: Right. Paul Conti: But if they go and do that on the other side, the infection actually is gone. So they do not have the symptoms that it was constantly spinning off inside of them. And they also don't have the risk that maybe that infection gets out of the abscess and their life is then at risk. So the parallel is looking into the unconscious mind to what is inside of us that may be acting like that abscess. Even though this is an analogy, it is not theoretical. This happens all the time. And the abscess inside that person emotionally may be the bullying that went on right around the time of puberty. It may be that awful boss who is just so mean and took that good job away from me. Andrew Huberman: Right. Paul Conti: It might be that. It might be that assault that I don't want to think about that's really still with me. It might be that death I still feel guilty about. I don't know what it is. But if there's an abscess in there, we want to understand it and then fix it, cure it. And that's what the therapy process can do. And that's why at times, therapy is unpleasant. The crying and the anger. That's the parallel of going through the surgery. Andrew Huberman: Right. Paul Conti: But on the other side, we've dissipated the energy inside of it. We've taken care of it. And that's why it is so important to go into the unconscious mind if there are things that are really troubling us or if we don't know what's going on, to cast a net of inquiry that may lead us there, because trauma is so common, and we shove trauma underneath the surface because of the guilt and shame that it generates, and then it stays in us like an abscess and spins off. Symptoms, they could be symptoms of diffidence, they could be symptoms of overusing a substance. They could be symptoms of avoiding good things in our life. But they're pervasive symptoms that are really harmful to us, that we can understand and fix. Andrew Huberman: In addition to quality therapy, what are some other"}
{"question": "What are some ways to access and explore the unconscious mind without the need for therapy, and how can developing curiosity and being dispassionate about oneself lead to a deeper understanding of one's thoughts, emotions, and behaviors?", "doc_id": "yOJvm_ri_hk_12", "video_id": "yOJvm_ri_hk", "video_title": "Dr. Paul Conti: Tools and Protocols for Mental Health | Huberman Lab Guest Series", "video_header": "Exploring the Unconscious Mind, Curiosity, “Question the Givens”", "segment_idx": "12", "time_start": "1:02:02", "time_end": "1:10:41", "context": "ways to access the unconscious? Earlier we were talking about journaling and spelling out one's life narrative in written or in spoken form, either alone or with a trusted other. Let's assume that somebody either can't afford or is just not at the place where they're willing to do therapy yet. But they fully adopt this abscess model, or this abscess analogy that you described, which I think is an exceptional one, because, a, you have the 20-plus years of clinical experience knowing this exists. But also, I think we all, at some level kind of understand that there's stuff happening within us that we can't explain. And I, as a neuroscientist, can absolutely say that most of the neural machinery in your head and the parts of it that are in your body, we don't have access to it. We love to think that we do, but we don't. It's just clicking away under there. So let's say somebody wants to make some progress, really improve their level of mental health, obtain more agency and gratitude, improve all aspects of their life and their generative drive. What are some ways that they can start to tap into the unconscious? And my guess is, if it's not in therapy, it's going to be by looking at in some of these other cupboards as you're describing them, right? Paul Conti: Yes. Develop and embrace curiosity about yourself. And if you can go for that curiosity, being dispassionate in the sense that you talk about these files you have with memories and events from your past, that's so good, because you're exploring your life. So someone who wants to understand themselves better, do that for yourself. Go look at pictures, talk to people you knew at different stages of life, reflect upon how you behaved at different stages of life, what you felt inside. Anchor yourself to memories and then extrapolate from there. Become curious about yourself, and if you can, be dispassionate. This idea that sometimes gets called an observing ego. Andrew Huberman: Right. Paul Conti: There are other words to put to it, but it's not ego in a negative sense. Here, it means the ability to stand outside of oneself and go. And to really think about oneself without the negative emotion, we're often able to either see the trauma, for example, or see the change. Like, why did I go from feeling really good about myself, and I felt like I could do anything? And then just a couple of years later, man, look at me, I'm mopey in the pictures. And then, yeah, I was drinking more. I stopped taking care of myself. That's a pretty big change, right? So now we're calling attention. What's that change? And a lot of times, the person knew it. Like, oh, I got rejected. I had that terrible breakup. And they knew it was a terrible breakup, but they keep shoving it under the surface. Maybe they didn't know it was a terrible breakup. Maybe they can't figure out what it is. That's okay, right? Even if they recognize, look, there was a change, then that will put the lie to what in this example is likely going on. So that person likely frames themselves in a way that is very negative and always was true. Right? I can never achieve anything. I never feel good. No one likes me. I can't find a partner. Whatever it is we say to ourselves, it's always been that way. Andrew Huberman: Right. Paul Conti: Because the negative emotion is so strong, and that part of our brain doesn't care about the clock and the calendar, and then the person goes back and thinks, it was not always that way. Right? And it comes to this a lot in therapy. It doesn't have to be, as you said, in therapy. But, no, I was a go-getter. Andrew Huberman: Right. Paul Conti: I'm thinking of the person who said that I was a go-getter, and I went out there and did things which put the lie to her, saying that she was lazy, incapable, all those things that were not true, but she accepted as truth. So she needed, from that mathematical perspective, like, to go back and question the givens. From our perspective, we're saying, go look in the unconscious mind. Go look in that part of the pillar of the structure of self. Go look there. That's the deepest part, the most complicated part, but it doesn't mean we can't understand it. And if we start to gain understanding, then we can think more about the conscious mind. Like, wait a second, what am I thinking about? What do I think about that? Andrew Huberman: Right. Paul Conti: Have I really thought about this? Or is it just running over and over in my head? What would I like to do about it? Maybe I'd like to learn more. Maybe I want to go get a book that I think could help me, listen to another podcast that could help me, talk to a friend. Like, maybe I want to do those things. So now the flow between the unconscious mind and the conscious mind becomes much more robust. And that lets us look further to look at the next level up, the defense mechanisms that grow up out of the unconscious mind, and we can have some understanding of them even though they're unconscious. So the idea of wait, when something shifted in me, how did my way of engaging with the world kind of change? I was perseverant. And I would take some of that energy in me that wasn't so good. And remember, I could put it into exercising and taking care of myself. And then that sort of shifted and I became sarcastic and cynical, and I started avoiding those of my friends who are really taking care of themselves and doing well, because that made me feel worse about myself. That's a dialogue that is reflective of defense mechanisms. Now the person isn't going to necessarily say, oh, I used a lot of sublimation, which is good, and then I started using reaction formation and avoidance, just as an example. But they're going to understand that in words, that whatever words they put to it, they understand that there was a change, they put words to that they can understand that process of change. It's not opaque. They're shining light on it. And now they can gain a better understanding of it and they can change it. Even that realization that I was much more functional, things were different. I mean, that can be a treasure trove of very relevant, very important and very positive information to bring to the current situation. Andrew Huberman: I think we often romance the idea of the person who can just live life forward, who doesn't look back, who just doesn't really explore their past, is just action oriented. Because after all, when we wake up in the morning, all we can control is our actions going forward. We can't rescript the actions of past, ours or others. Paul Conti: That is such a good point of what happens when we're just looking forward. We become like a sprinter who comes out of the blocks too fast. So if you think about the beginning of a 100 meters dash, they're the best sprinters in the world, say, and there they are in the blocks. And if they come out of those blocks in the right way, they will gain momentum, they will keep their form, and they will run as fast as they can. But if they do not pay attention to what is behind them, the blocks that are supporting their body. The whole bigger picture here of the limitations within the body. They have to know what those limitations are. They have to understand themselves. That's how they avoid coming out of the block so fast and then sprawling headlong onto the track. And we see that happen, too. So if we're just looking forward and thought and idea, that's how to live life, we will be tripping forward, and ultimately, we'll be like that sprinter. No matter how great a sprinter, if you come out of the blocks too fast, you're going to trip forward. Andrew Huberman: Yes, I know I said this in a different form a few minutes ago, but I think a lot of people are afraid of self- inquiry, because they just don't want the thing that they discover which resides in their unconscious, the abscess, if you will, or the damaging thought or thing that happened, which they are aware of, but are pushing down, to take over their daily life in a way that doesn't allow them to be at least as functional as they are in the moment. Paul Conti: If you go visit the person who had the abscess cured by the surgeon, on postop day one, that person will be less functional. They'll be in a hospital bed. They won't be able to get up out of the bed. They won't be able to exercise. They're not going to feel their best. That's okay. It is okay that we, at times, can become intermittently, say, less functional. In the sense that we're more upset, that I'm spending more time crying. That's okay. Because that's part of the energy, the effort, the choice that gets us to a better place."}
{"question": "What is the fourth component of the social homeostasis circuit that involves subjective understanding and establishing one's place in a hierarchy?", "doc_id": "RgAcOqVRfYA_4", "video_id": "RgAcOqVRfYA", "video_title": "Science of Social Bonding in Family, Friendship & Romantic Love", "video_header": "Social Homeostasis & Neural Circuits for Social Drive", "segment_idx": "4", "time_start": "13:35", "time_end": "18:52", "context": "on social bonding comes from the laboratory of Kay Tye. Kay is a professor at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, she's an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. And in recent years, I would say in about the last five or six years, her laboratory has made a fundamental discovery as to why we seek out and put so much effort into social bonds. And the key discovery that she made is that much like hunger, much like temperature, much like thirst, we have brain circuits that are devoted to what's called a social homeostasis. Many of you have probably heard about homeostasis before, homeostasis is the characteristic of various biological circuits and even individual cells to try and maintain a certain level. It's most easily thought of in the context of hunger, if you don't eat for a while, your drive to pursue food and think about food and make food and spend money on food, and indeed to enjoy food goes up. Whereas when you're well fed, you don't tend to seek out food with as much vigor or as much intensity, you wouldn't invest as much time, effort, money, et cetera. So homeostasis is the aspect of cells, tissues, and organisms to seek some sort of balance to regulate themselves. In a crude way, you can think about the thermostat on your home as a homeostatic circuit. When the temperature goes up a little bit, it cools things down to maintain a certain temperature. When the room gets cold, it hits a certain level and a sensor detects that, it clicks on and then the heat goes on to maintain a certain set temperature. So that's a simple way of thinking about homeostasis. Every homeostatic circuit has three components, or at least three, one is a detector, meaning the organism or the thermostat on your wall has to have some way of detecting what's going on in the environment, all right, in the context of social bonding, whether or not you are interacting with others and whether or not those interactions are going well. So that has to be detected, that's the first thing. Then there has to be a control center, that's the second thing. And the control center is the one that makes the adjustments to, in the case of social bonding, to your behavior and to your psychology. So you'll soon learn that there are ways in which the more time that you spend alone, the more motivated you are to seek out the pictures of faces, the interactions with actual people, physical contact, and so forth. Now that might seem obvious to you, but thanks to the work of Kay Tye and others, it's remarkable to learn that there are specific brain centers that are adjusting our psychology and biology so that we seek out bonds more aggressively, or maybe we don't because we are perfectly sated or satiated with respect to how much contact we've had with other people. Now, the third component of this homeostatic circuit is the effector. The effector is actually what drives the behavioral response, it's what leads you to pick up your social media and start scrolling, it's what leads you to text a friend, it's what leads you to call a friend or make plans and what leads you to follow through on those plans. So again, those three components are a detector, a control center, and an effector. And as you'll soon learn, the neural circuit that controls the social homeostasis actually has a fourth component, and that fourth component is one that places subjective understanding as to why you are doing what you are doing, and establishes your place in a hierarchy. Now, I know the word hierarchy can be a little bit of a barbed wire one because people immediately start thinking about boss and subordinate, or in couples, a leader and a follower. But when we talk about social hierarchies in the context of human interactions, social hierarchies are very plastic, meaning in one setting, one person can be the leader, in another setting, the other person can be the leader. You probably have groups of friends or family members where you're constantly passing the baton as to who's going to drive, who's going to navigate, who's going to pick the restaurant, who's going to clear the dishes and who's going to do certain activities and not others. So hierarchies are very dynamic. And as a consequence, social has to be very plastic and very fluid so that you move from one environment to the next, even with the same people, you have to be able to make those adjustments. And in the case of the social homeostasis circuit, those adjustments are made by a particular brain structure, I've talked about on this podcast before, it's called the prefrontal cortex, it is the seat of our higher consciousness, if you will. It's what allows us to play subjective labels on things so we are not strictly input output, we're not robotic. Meaning if you go to dinner with a friend and they are exceptional at choosing restaurants, well, in the context of the social homeostasis circuit, your prefrontal cortex would allow them to pick the restaurant because basically they are dominant over you in their capacity to pick good restaurants, at least in this example. Whereas as you leave that restaurant and perhaps you are navigating to a where to get a drink after dinner, or where to walk through the city, perhaps you have the better sense of direction. And so then the social bonding has to be maintained as you switch the hierarchy, okay? So that's the role of that fourth element, the prefrontal cortex. Now I just briefly want to touch on some of the brain areas that thanks to the work of Kay Tye and others,"}
{"question": "What are the two main barriers that prevent adults from giving others permission to feel their emotions, and how do these barriers impact relationships and emotional well-being?",

just recognize that the feelings are moving through us as this five year-old gosh uh was and is able to do because I feel like it gets to the heart of a lot of what we hear in the psychological and wellness space which is you know feelings are just feelings they're transient they represent all sorts of things and we can get to the biological underpinnings or the the um you know childhood trauma root root cause underpinnings the all sorts of things genetics for that matter should we feel our feelings in order to best recognize them I would imagine yes um is there any value to suppressing our feelings or does that tend to just grow the feeling what is known about this from the research literature because you see a lot of different opinions about this but I I'd like to know um have there been any experiments where people are placed into a negative or positive emotion or are experiencing a negative or positive emotion and then intentionally try to suppress it has there been any brain Imaging any measurement of of galvanic skin response like does the emotion grow or does the emotion shrink it tends to grow um there are cultural differences just to be frank but in you know Western culture um suppression tends not to have great outcomes uh finding ways to reappraise tends to be more helpful this really gets into though for me the core of my work because you know for 20 years of my life I was running a center for emotional intelligence and teaching skills and I would go around and I would see a lot of resistance a lot of resistance whether it was you know the hedge fund manager or the superintendent of schools or a parent you know I've had fathers come up to me say things like you know Mark you're so vulnerable like you shared your whole story about being like I would never in my wildest dream ever share with my own son that I was bullied as a kid and I'm like tell me more of course you know I'm a psychologist and in the end you know what you know the guy was afraid that his son would think he was weak and so we have a mindset about feelings that we have to talk about people have feelings about their feelings sometimes we call those meta emotions or meta feelings sometimes it's just that happy is good anger is bad it's that simple my whole uh Recent research has focused on something I call permission to feel you know you know a little bit about my own story I had a pretty rough childhood that included abuse it included a lot of bullying and I had two parents who love me but um you know my mother was a very anxious woman who never had strategies so you know she was always saying I'm having a nervous breakdown and she'd lock herself in her room and she wouldn't come out for a few few hours my father was as we might call today you know uh the tough guy who was kind of toxically masculine son you got tough and up he even said to me once you know he's gone now and we have a good we had a good relationship but I'll never forget he said you know son I used to be kids up like you he said that he did and he didn't I mean he thought that was a message that I needed to hear to toughen up right that was he was doing that through love I mean it was not emotionally intelligent parenting but that's was the way he thought and you know he did love me he just didn't how to be a parent in that way um and so think about that bullied shame fear abused all kinds of stuff going on in my head mom having nervous breakdowns father toughen up what happens you suppress you deny you ignore you eat you do all kinds of weird behaviors because you have nowhere to go with with your feelings and I fear that way too many people feel that way right now and I have good research to show that um you know you've read my book you know I had an uncle Marvin he was a middle school teacher who you know by some wave of a magic wand was staying with my family one summer when I was 12 and he noticed something in my facial expression my body language he knew something was off and he was the first adult who sat with me and said hey Mark how are you feeling and I don't know if it was his facial expression his body language his vocal tone but that was the opener for me I'm not doing so well I don't really like life very much I'm scared and he didn't say I'm going to have a nervous breakdown or toughen up he said we're going to get through this I got you I'm with you and it's really interesting to me because you know I feel like we're so focused on skill building which is really important but I want to take a step back and say are we giving ourselves are we giving our colleagues our partners our children the permission to feel and I feel like a lot of people don't have that permission now my research shows with tens of thousands of people across cultures that only about a third of adults felt that they had someone when they were young who created the conditions for them to have permission to feel I mean 70% of the people walking around here right now in our corporations in our schools in our homes 30% felt like they had that and then you wonder what do you think the characteristics are of these people the characteristics of the uncle Marvins or Aunt maras or the colleague at work by the way this also works in the adult Workforce you can have an emotion uh Mentor or a feelings coach at work there's three characteristics do you want to take a guess um I'm guessing empathically attuned okay um all of that's a for those that know empathy is a is a involves a bunch of subcategories so I won't acknowledge that empathically attuned um I'm guessing that they have themselves some high high emotional intelligence um and the third is um gosh I My Hope Is that there be a a uh High situational awareness yeah right because your uncle needed to see something subtle in your facial expression or maybe not so subtle but everyone else was missing it but but um to be able to detect that there was something that really need it was like a silent Cry for Help yeah you're getting at like you're really Nuance which is that's why you're a scientist too the three broad characteristics the first one that show shows up cross-culturally non-judgmental like when we think about the people who gave us permission to feel they just had no judgment they let me be who I can be or who I am the second is empathic and kind of coupled with compassionate which is kind of the different form of empathy the third primarily is active listening people want to be around people who don't judge them who listen actively and show that they care it's that simple and I'll tell you it's really um interesting to me because you know I do a lot of public speaking and often my my new strategy is I do surveys where I'm going to be presenting so I can present the audience themselves with their data and so I'm giving this speech to a bunch of adult parents High School parents and I'm showing the data from them they filled out the survey non-judgmental active listening empathy compassion and and and I show just like my national study a third of you said yes two-thirds of you said no so this this this mom and she's like just like impulsively jumps out of his seat she's like I'm having an epiphany I'm like okay and she's like I know I'm certain that my daughter has an uncle Marvin I I know it and I'm also certain that my son doesn't and you know something Mark I am leaving your presentation today and I am finding my son his uncle Marvin I'm like lady it could be you uh and it was interesting it's kind of going right by her it's like Outsourcing right like there's your karate teacher there's your feelings mentor and it's interesting to me and I push on this in my research now what is the resistance like what are people so afraid of I mean they're so afraid of feelings their own and their childr or their partners and so I asked you know I push on this and what's really interesting and sad to me is that adults today the two barriers I'm going to now I'm going to push you again what do you think the two things that get in the way of giving other people permission to feel this is actually where my next question was going so I'll just ask the question in the form of an answer is this like Jeopardy I guess that's what you do or no it's the other way around in Jeopardy sorry you can see how many episodes of Jeopardy I've watched um that that if people don't have adequate bound emotional boundaries and they are maybe even too empathically attuned that someone they care about experiencing anger or sadness or frustration maybe even with them would shift their own emotions um and not make them able to be available with the three qualities that you listed off before in particular non-judgment because now it's personal mhm and so it would undermine the process you're you're right there um the first one though is just a really interesting one just time people I don't have the time you don't have the time to be non-judgmental like can you talk to me about that one please it's actually the case that we don't have the time to be judgmental it's far too energetically costly yeah I agree um the second really goes back to the skills so I've had parents say things like I'm afraid to ask my child how they're feeling cuz I'm not going to be able to handle it I mean think about that for a minute I'm not going to be able to handle it so you'd rather your son or daughter suppress their fears or their whatever they're feeling because you haven't developed the skills that you need to help co-regulate and support them you know this is again going back to you know my Mission Vision you know is that we need a world where everyone gets an emotion education preschool to high school and it's got to continue in college and it's got to continue in the workforce and it's got to continue in our as we grow older because as a 54y old person right now who leads a large group of people Co hits like I had a complete meltdown I don't know how to like lead during Co I was trying to figure it out doing Zoom meetings and you know crazy stuff and then my mother-in-law got stuck with me and that was a real kind of wakeup call in terms of like relationship building um and was really rough for me actually she came for a wedding uh one of my colleagues got married on March 3rd of 2020 well my mother-in-law is from Panama and so just so you know all flights to Panama got cancelled by March 13th and they didn't open until September so we had this 81-year-old lovely lovely woman but like you know it's a lot for your mother-in-law to live with you for eight months one little quick Side Story for this I just I think it's it's relevant so like it was getting really you know I'm working from home my mother-in-law was there she wants me to make her cappuccino every morning which I like to do for the first week But like after the fourth month like learn how to use the machine and I don't want to do it myself I'm afraid of the machine I'm like sorry I'm not I I didn't mean to laugh out loud that's all right those cappuccino machines can be scary they can be but like growth mindset right like watch me I'll help you do it no I want you to make the coffee I'm like you got to make your own coffee you got like I I told you I don't like people in the morning you got to make your own coffee anyhow one night we're at dinner and uh she looks at me in Sp she speaks Spanish I speak Spanish and so she said you know in Spanish are you really the director of the center for emotional intelligence and I looked at I'm like not tonight not tonight like it's we're going down and it was a mess oh I'm sorry I didn't mean to laugh I laughed before you said it was a mess I just your uh impression of the question it's a maybe a Drew to mind some experiences of yeah I mean and there it was like yes my day job is I run a center for emotional intelligence but like I'm a human being who had strong emotions and I didn't have the strategies and I needed to cultivate a whole new set of Regulation strategies to deal with that new aspect of my life in thinking about people that can really

capacity is possible I'm guessing the answer is yes and whether or not increasing lung capacity is a good goal and route to enhancing fat loss essentially what I'm asking is if you can offload more CO2 okay carbons per exhale are you a more efficient fat loss machine it's a wonderful thought and the answer would be no not something need to worry about because if you were to Exhale more carbon than actually needed now we're in a state of inefficiency you're burning way more energy than needed to do your activity the heart has a metric called cardiac output this is in science we abbreviate this as Q for some odd reasons it's either Co or q and cardiac output is heart rate multiplied by stroke volume so it's how many beads per minute you're having as well as how much blood's coming out of it so cardiac output is actually very specific to energy needs if you try to work around that it's just going to adjust itself so what I mean by this is if you were able to increase your stroke volume the amount of blood coming out per pump you would automatically adjust to reduce your heart rate so that you keep cardiac output exact to energetic demands so you're sort of pushing one end of the of the spectrum but your body will pull the other one back to keep you at that exact same neutral level so um if you look at if you think about like cardiovascular adaptations to endurance training any type of endurance training a common thing people will understand is resting heart rate and so what that number is is just how many beats per minute you're having when you're sitting here doing nothing a very positive adaptation is a lowering of that resting rate over time um as general numbers what you will hear is people will say things like a a normal resting heart rate is between 60 to 80 beats per minute and you know if any of the things I've talked about um with the individuals I work with I don't work with anybody with disease just to clarify that I don't do anything with disease management treatment anything it's always about people who are in a good spot who want to optimize or get to the next level whether this is professional athletes trying to to to Peak for physical performance or uh the folks in our rapid Health optimization program that feel good again it's not disease stuff and they want to feel incredible one of the metrics we're going to pay attention to is this resting heart rate so here's what happens as you improve your endurance your resting heart rate will go down if I see somebody over 70 beats per minute um unless something's going on you're not physically fit regardless of whether or not that is quote unquote within the normative values I want to see everybody sub 60 beats per minute or close right and that is not a difficult thing to really get to for most people so if you train a lot regardless of how you train intervals steady state doesn't matter that resting heart rate will come down but since energy demands at rest haven't really changed cardiac output stays the same so what happens is stroke volume goes up so literally like we trained your quadriceps on the leg exension machine to get stronger so you can produce more Force per contraction the heart will do the exact same thing and so as you're able to get more of the blood out of your heart per pump the heart realizes I don't need to pump as often so that's the compensatory adaptation which is saying hey look I don't need to beat 60 times a minute I now need to beat 55 times a minute because I'm getting the same amount of Blood Out per pump chill and this is why your wrestling heart rate goes down your resting stroke volume goes up but your cardiac output is identical so that's not a good metric of Fitness it's going to stay the same cardiac output will only adjust per energetic changes all right uh energy requirements in the acute moment right how much do I need go which is going to be determined by ventilation right how much air am I bringing in and putting out that's going to determine cardiac output and that's going to determine where we're at if you were to do like a submaximal exercise test when you were unfit to when you're fit or when you're fit to where you're super fit at submax you're going to see the same thing cardiac output will be identical and you're like damn nothing happened what you're not realizing is your heart rate at that same workload is now lower and that's efficiency because your stroke volume is higher where it gets people tripped up is at Max because you may not see much of a change at Max um because you won't really you don't really see an increase in maximum heart rate with Fitness that's not a thing right so maximum heart rate is not a good proxy for fit or unfit or anything like that um stroke volume will get limited eventually by filling capacity of your heart it has to have so much time to fill up with blood before it can contract again and squeeze the blood out and when you have a heart rate of 200 beats per minute that just doesn't leave much time to fill and so it won't really push you past that so um don't worry about trying to increase your maximum heart rate that's not necessarily a good thing and it won't really change but your cardiac output will because stroke volume will be higher but that doesn't necessarily mean that I should avoid training that gets me up toward maximum heart rate correct oh you should absolutely do it right that's what that was my assumption I'd"}
{"question": "Do waking up in the middle of the night, even for short periods, have a significant impact on my overall health and well-being, or can I still get a good night's sleep with occasional brief awakenings?", "doc_id": "gbQFSMayJxk_6", "video_id": "gbQFSMayJxk", "video_title": "Dr. Matt Walker: The Science & Practice of Perfecting Your Sleep", "video_header": "Waking in the Middle Of The Night", "segment_idx": "6", "time_start": "32:20", "time_end": "39:41", "context": "- Yeah, it's incredible. I want to introduce a another Gedankenexperiment, other thought experiment. So in this arc of the night, slow wave sleep predominates early in the night, and then REM sleep. There's a scenario that many people including myself experience on a regular basis. Which is they go to sleep, sleeping just fine, three, four hours into it, they wake up. They wake up, for whatever reason, maybe there was a noise, maybe the temperature isn't right, we will certainly talk about sleep hygiene, etcetera. They get up, they go to the restroom, they might flip on the lights, they might not, they'll get back in bed hopefully they're not picking up their phone and starting to browse and wake up the brain through various mechanisms light and cognitive stimulation, etcetera. They go back to sleep, let's say after about 10, 15 minutes, they're able to fall back asleep. And then they sleep till their more typical wake time. How detrimental is that wake up episode or event in terms of longevity, learning, et cetera? I would love to sleep the entire night through every night, but most nights I don't. And yet, I feel pretty good throughout the day, some days better than others. So if you were to kind of evaluate that waking episode, and compare it to sleeping the whole night through, what are your your thoughts on that? - So I think if you're waking up sort of frequently, as you're describing, I would probably get your estate in order because my guess is within the next year, you're going to be you're going to be done for, no I'm kidding you. Absolutely kidding you. It is perfectly natural and normal, particularly as we progress with age, you know, children tend to have typically more continuous sleep. Now it's not that they aren't waking up for brief periods of time they are and in fact, we all do. When we come out the other end of our sleep cycle at the end of our REM sleep period of the 90 minute cycle, almost everybody wakes up and we make a postural movement, we turn over because we've been paralyzed for so long and the body will also like to shift it's weight or position. - Do we ever look around? Ever open our eyes and look around? - You, sometimes people will open their eyes, but usually it's only for a brief period of time and they usually never commit those awakenings to memory. Your situation and it's my situation as well, I usually now at this stage of life, I don't sleep through the night. I'll usually have a bathroom break and then I'll come back. That's perfectly normal. We tend to forget that in sleep science, we think of sleep efficiency so of the total amount of time that you're in bed, how much of that percent time is spent asleep? And we usually look to numbers that are above 85%, or more as a healthy sleep efficiency. So if you're to think about me going to bed and I spend, you know, let's say, eight and a quarter, eight and a half hours of time in bed, with a normal, healthy sleep efficiency, I still may be only sleeping a total of seven and a half hours, or seven and three quarter hours. Meaning that I'm going to be awake in total, not in one long about, but I'm going to be awake for upwards of 30 minutes, net some time. Sometimes that can be after a 10 minute, you know, dalliance after having gone to the bathroom, and I'm just gradually drifting back off again. Other times, it will just be for a couple of minutes. And most of those you don't commit. So I think we need to stop, we don't need to get too worried about, you know, periods of time awake, just because we're not sleeping throughout the night. I would love to do that, too. And I remember when that used to happen, and it still happens occasionally. - Every once in a while, it feels great when it does happen. - And it's a lovely thing. - It's a surprise right? Like oh my goodness I slept through the whole night. - It is now a surprise, yeah it is a surprise. But for the most part, I think we can be more relaxed about that where we have to be a bit more attentive, though, is if you're spending long periods of time, not being able to get back to sleep. And usually we define that by saying, if it's been 20, 25 minutes, normally, that's the time when we would really say okay, let's explore this, what's going on? Let's see what's happening. The other thing is if it's happening very frequently, so even if you're, you know, not awake for 25 minutes stretches, but you're finding yourself waking up and being consciously aware that you've woken up for maybe six, seven or eight times throughout the night and your sleep is very what we call fragmented the great science of sleep in the past five or 10 years has been yes, quantity is important, but quality is just as important. And you can't have one without the other in terms of a good beneficial next day outcome. You can't just get four hours of sleep, but brilliant quality of sleep and be unimpaired. Nor can you get eight hours of sleep, but have very poor quality of sleep and be unimpaired the next day. So that's why I just sort of want to asterisk, this idea of let's not get too worried about waking up and having some time awake, that's perfectly normal and natural. But if it's happening very frequently throughout the night, or those periods of time, or long stretches of time, upwards of 25 minutes, then let's look into it. - Well, I can assure you just helped a lot of people feel better about this waking up episode that I and many other people experience. - I hope so 'cause I think it's really important that we, you know, I think I've been desperately guilty of perhaps, you know, early on being too puritanical about, you know, sleep and I've retrospected, and I've tried to explore why this was the case, you know, it was almost sleep or else, dot, dot, dot. And at the time when I was starting to write the book, which was back in 2016, you know, sleep was still a neglected stepsister in the health conversation of today. And I could see all of the, - That has certainly changed. - And it's changing, you know, and not because it's my efforts, but because of all of my colleagues. - I would say, well, it's great that you give attribution to the other people involved. And of course, it's a big field. But I think you've done a great service by cueing people to the importance of this state, not just for avoiding troublesome outcomes, but also for optimizing their waking state. It's really, you know, I view sleep as this period that feels good, but we're not aware of how it feels when we're in it necessarily. It has tremendous benefits when you're doing it well, so to speak, and it has tremendous deficits when we're not. And I think it was an important thing for you to do to cue people to this issue. And I would say mission accomplished, that people are aware of the need for sleep. I think that knowing that waking up in the middle of the night is normal, provided it's not too frequent is great and will also help people who may have been overly concerned about that. I do want to use this as an opportunity"}
{"question": "Can you explain how blocking out external stimuli can help reveal insights from your unconscious mind, especially during times when your brain is in a liminal state?", "doc_id": "yOJvm_ri_hk_5", "video_id": "yOJvm_ri_hk", "video_title": "Dr. Paul Conti: Tools and Protocols for Mental Health | Huberman Lab Guest Series", "video_header": "Unconscious Mind, Salience & Journaling; Panic Attacks", "segment_idx": "5", "time_start": "24:46", "time_end": "28:12", "context": "life narrative or thinks about some great or sadly traumatic events that perhaps happened to them at whatever stage of life, that there is something accomplished in that action or in that therapy session, if they're doing it with a clinician, but that when they go to sleep that night and perhaps in their waking states as well, that the unconscious is working some of that through such, that revelations come to mind, later insights come to mind. I'm certainly familiar with the fact that there are certain times of day and evening where my brain is in a bit of a liminal state. It feels like somewhere between sleep and awake. And I just have learned that provided I block against outside sensory input as much as I can, in particular social media and the news, that I'll just be doing the dishes or preparing coffee or something, and something will come to mind seemingly out of nowhere. It's not always a great insight. In fact, it's rarely a great insight, but it always takes me a bit by surprise. Sometimes a little bit of delight, sometimes a little bit of shock. Like, wow, where did that come from? Paul Conti: Because it came from your unconscious mind, right? It was invisible to you. Then it got thrown up and you're like, whoa. And you realize it while in the midst of doing something relatively mundane. Because during the day you're engaging, your brain is highly engaged, which is great, but it doesn't leave a lot of room for the unconscious mind to do its millions and millions of things a second that can help you figure things out, which is the same reason it's uncanny. Any psychiatrist will tell you this, that a person will come in and say, it's strange. All of a sudden when I can finally relax, that's when I have a panic attack. Or they don't know. Then I can finally relax and I go, then my heart's beating fast and I'm sweating. Because that's when the panic attacks come. If the person is laboring under something that is causing them this constant distress. When you stop focusing outward and you sort of settle into an inward state, then the things that are underneath the surface are going to come to the surface. And if there's something really bothering you that your brain is very upset about or very afraid of, what does it throw up to the surface? A panic attack. But if you're in a good place, you're taking care of yourself, you're in a generative stage, you're in a safe environment. Then when you stop putting all the attention outward, so we imagine then salience changes. And instead of a lot of the salience being outward, it starts to be inward. And you're just sort of meditative. You're washing the dishes. And there's room then for your unconscious mind to throw something important to the surface. It's the exact opposite of how people can't remember something if they're trying to think of it. I mean, we all go through this like, I can't remember that person's name or that restaurant or whatever it is, try to keep thinking about it and see if you figure it out. The answer is not in your conscious mind. So if you keep bringing your conscious mind to bear, you just generate frustration. But then when you stop thinking about it, the answer is there inside of you. Oh, I remember now. So that's how if we have the conscious mind engaged in something, it's not going to figure out. Then it doesn't figure the thing out. And that works for our problems, too. That's why a person can say, I thought about that for ten years. No, you ruminated about it for ten years. It just ran over and over and over in the conscious mind. And how ironic, right? It prevents understanding."}
{"question": "What is the relationship between breathing patterns and heart rate variability, and how can extending the exhale be used to control heart rate?", "doc_id": "x4m_PdFbu-s_15", "video_id": "x4m_PdFbu-s", "video_title": "How to Breathe Correctly for Optimal Health, Mood, Learning & Performance | Huberman Lab Podcast", "video_header": "Breathing & Heart Rate Variability", "segment_idx": "15", "time_start": "1:39:17", "time_end": "1:46:16", "context": "This is an incredibly important topic, so much so that I perhaps should have brought it up at the beginning of the episode. But nonetheless, you now know what your diaphragm does. When you inhale, your diaphragm moves down. That's right. When you contract your diaphragm, it moves down. It creates space for your lungs to inhale. And when you exhale, your diaphragm moves up. Well, when you inhale and your diaphragm moves down, what happens is there's more space created in the thoracic cavity and particularly if you're also breathing deeply and you're using those intercostal muscles to expand your ribs. As a consequence, the heart actually gets a little bit bigger. It's a temporary enlargement in the heart. But it's a real enlargement. And as a consequence, whatever blood is in the heart is now in a larger volume because the heart got bigger. And as a consequence, that blood is moving more slowly through that larger volume for a short period of time. But nonetheless, it's moving more slowly. Your nervous system detects that and sends a neural signal to the heart to speed the heart rate up. In other words, inhales increase heart rate. The opposite is true when you exhale. When you exhale, your diaphragm moves up. Your rib cage tends to move inward a bit. And you compact the heart. You reduce the volume of the heart overall. When you reduce the volume of the heart overall, blood flow through the heart accelerates because it's a smaller volume. So a given unit of blood is going to move more quickly through that small volume. Your nervous system detects that and sends a signal to slow the heart down. So just as inhales speed the heart up, exhales slow your heart rate down. Now, of course, even though you can double up on inhales or even triple up on inhales, sooner or later, if you inhale, you're going to have to exhale. And the converse is also true, of course. So what does this mean in terms of controlling your heart rate? Well, let's say you are going in for a blood draw, or you're going out on stage and you're stressed. Well, I would encourage you to do a physiological sigh, maybe two physiological sighs to bring your level of calm up and your level of stress down. Nonetheless, if you have any reason why you want to quickly reduce your heart rate or accelerate your heart rate for sake of physical work output or to calm yourself down additionally, not just use the physiological sigh, well, then you can take advantage of this relationship between inhales and exhales controlling heart rate. If you want to increase your heart rate, you can simply inhale longer and more vigorously relative to your exhales. And if you want to decrease your heart rate, well, then you're going to make your exhales longer and/or more vigorous than your inhales. In fact, this process, which is called respiratory sinus arrhythmia, is the basis of what we call heart rate variability. Heart rate variability involves the vagus nerve, the 10th cranial nerve, which is a parasympathetic nerve that is associated with a calming aspect of the autonomic nervous system, slowing your heart rate down by extending your exhales. And it really forms the basis of most all breathing practices. If you look at any breathing practices, whether or not it's Wim Hof breathing, Tummo breathing, Kundalini breathing, Pranayama breathing, physiological sighing, cyclic sighing, and on and on and on, if you were to measure the ratio of inhales to exhales and the vigor of inhales to exhales, what you would find is that each one would create a net increase or a net decrease in heart rate that could be very accurately predicted by whether or not that breathing practice emphasized inhales, emphasized exhales, or had those two features, inhale and exhale, be of equal duration and intensity. In fact, if you wanted to equilibrate your heart rate, what you would do is you would do box breathing because inhale, hold, exhale, hold is, by definition, creating equal duration inhales and exhales of essentially equivalent vigor. When you do a physiological sigh, you're doing two big inhales, which is going the speed your heart rate up just a little bit, but then a long extended exhale. The exhale in the end is much longer than the two inhales even when combined. And so you get a net decrease in heart rate, the calming effect. And then practices such as Tummo breathing or Wim Hof breathing or cyclic hyperventilation, deep inhales and exhales, the inhales are more vigorous compared to the more passive exhales-- are going to lead to increases in heart rate. So the relationship between breathing and heart rate is an absolutely lockstep one where your heart rate follows your breathing. Your heart rate and your breathing are in an intimate discussion with one another, but where always and forever your inhales increase your heart rate, your exhales decrease it. Now, this feature, which physicians call respiratory sinus arrhythmia, or we sometimes hear about more often nowadays as heart rate variability, is something that people in sport have known about for a very long time. It's why, for instance, that marksmen will exhale just prior to taking a shot. That's particularly true for people that compete in the biathlon, where they cross country ski. So their heart rate is up, up, up, up, up. Then they'll get to the point where they actually have to shoot a target, and they'll exhale, and then they'll shoot the target. This is also why, for instance, if you want to bring your heart rate down very quickly between rounds of martial arts, there are a number of different ways to do that. But an extended exhale of any kind or, frankly, any breathing practice that emphasizes exhales is going to bring your heart rate down. This has been incorporated in a number of different contexts, including sport, military. It's also now being incorporated in a clinical context for people who feel a panic attack coming on. I'm very gratified to learn that the physiological sigh is now being explored as a tool to prevent panic attacks and anxiety attacks. This is prior to the panic attack, people bringing their heart rate down, again, through those extended exhales. So learning to extend your exhale is really a terrific skill to master, and it's a very easy skill to master, frankly. Why do I say a skill? Well, remember what I said earlier, which is that humans inhale actively and most typically will passively exhale, just let the air drop out of them at whatever rate, depending on how much air they inhaled. Actively exhaling, that is, actively relaxing the diaphragm and actively relaxing those intercostal muscles of the chest, those ones that are, I should say, between the ribs, is a skill that you can very quickly acquire and will allow you to use that relationship between the phrenic nerve, the diaphragm, and the size of the heart, the heart volume, and all that stuff to really take control of heart rate quickly. So that if you feel like your heart is racing too much-- and, frankly, a lot of people have a lot of what's called interoceptive awareness, especially anxious people. They can really sense what's going on in their body, other people less so. Like, oh my god, my heart's beating. It's ready to jump out of my chest, and I don't like that. I don't like that. Big, long exhale. It doesn't matter if you do it through the nose or the mouth. Big, long exhale is going to allow you to slow your heart rate down. Let's talk about hiccups. Everybody experiences hiccups from time to time. I think most people would agree that one hiccup is sort of funny. Two hiccups in a row is really funny. And three hiccups in a row is where"}

It takes investment. It takes time in not needing everything to be exactly the way you want it to be. I have a friend who struggles with this and oftentimes the conversations just circle back to the fact that when you want social connection, you often have to be more flexible. You have to eat on other people's schedules. Sometimes you have to eat things you don't necessarily want to eat the most in that moment or stay up a little later or wake up a little earlier. Social connection is something that we work for, but it is incredibly powerful. I want to, of course, tip my heart to, it's only appropriate to call him the great Robert Sapolsky, my colleague who I'm unfortunate to know at Stanford. Of course, he has talked about this quite a lot. So, I want to acknowledge Robert's incredible work and discussions around this. You can look up those materials online and his wonderful books. But primates, and we are primates, we are social species. And as Robert has said many times before, never before in any primate history, but in particular in human history have we interacted with so many strangers at a distance when we are not really connected to them. So, finding just a few people, even one or an animal or something that you delight in, believe it or not, has very positive effects on mitigating this long-term stress on improving various aspects of our life as it relates to stress and emotionality. So, that's the social connection part. The other thing is the social isolation that goes too long is associated in everything from flies, believe it or not,"}

Using Sleep to Improve Learning, Creativity & Memory | Huberman Lab Guest Series", "video_header": "Tools: Waking & Technology; Naps; “Sleep on a Problem”", "segment_idx": "24", "time_start": "2:11:12", "time_end": "2:20:43", "context": "takeaways here that um if if I may I I just wanted to um mention um a previous guest on this episode in fact he's been on the the podcast twice is the the great Rick Ruben oh I've listened to those yeah one of one of the most legendary music producers of all time and and the second episode that we did with Rick gets heavily into some of his protocols for lack of a better way to describe them and one of the things that Rick does is when he wakes up in the morning he makes it a point to he takes walks he gets Sunshine he hydrates he does all of those things but to try and make the transition between sleep and wakefulness to be rather gradual almost to allow some of the the components of sleep to um kind of bleed into the morning and then allow wakefulness to to come about um and in his case he's able to push some of the more uh linear processing and procedural things to later in the day um and I've spent a lot of time with Rick I'm fortunate to be close friends with Rick and and I can tell you that he also spends a fair amount of time you know sitting or lying down typically very still with his eyes closed just thinking or allowing thoughts to emerge as part of um his creative process now he's certainly not the only one to do this um but he's he's a notable example but what's the takeaway here should everyone be you know lying with their eyes closed um when they first wake up perhaps but there's a some potential dos but I think there's a really strong don't if one subscribes to the idea that during sleep there is substantial reorganization of neural circuitry AKA learning but also expansion of creative opportunity as you've clearly pointed out and there are data to support that statement then it stands to reason that upon waking there's a key opportunity to capture some of that information that is now in your mind um that was created the night before but that if you immediately look at your phone that you Eclipse that process with sensory input from somebody else's ideas and what's going on in the world and it's not to say that looking your phone first thing in the morning is a is a is a cardinal sin or a violation of any kind of neural neural circuit requirement but I in an attempt to try and capture some of the learning and creativity that occurs during sleep have tried for a while now to not look at my phone for at least the first 30 minutes after waking it's very challenging to do for for most everybody but rather to let some of the ideas um from sleep percolate up and I will often go you know be you know making a morning of tea or something and then go running to my office to write something down that suddenly Springs to mind and then I'll remember that this was something that came to me in a dream the night before none of which as significant as the Benzene ring or the periodic table or the kind of works that uh Rick has produced but I think that we need to be cautious about um not short circuiting these um these creative insights that no doubt can come to us and sleep I think it's very well worth just even for your own mental health firstly not to just wake up up and start your reception of the world but to do some as we've mentioned reflection on what you've just experienced by way of sleeping and it doesn't necessarily have to be that you're trying to recall your dreams just sit with whatever your thoughts are think about the the day ahead think about the days prior and there is some benefit and the creative benefit there you mentioned Einstein another one that is often mentioned to me is Edison uh Thomas Edison the in ventor and Edison was claimed to be a short sleeper people will say well he was a brilliant inventor but you know he said that he didn't sleep very much it turns out that Edison was a habitual Napper during the day and I've got lots of pictures of him him napping on his workbench um in his Studio him napping in the garden I love it well I took a 45 minute nap today yeah and it was he and I'm no Edison but I subscribed to his protocols um but you know he he understood the creative Brilliance of sleep to your point about writing things down and he used it ruthlessly as a tool and here's what he would do it's genius he would take a pair of Steel bull bearings in his right hand he would sit in his office on a reclining chair with a rest for his arm and then he would put a pad of paper and a pen next to him and then he would gradually start to relax off but what he' done was he' used a metal sauce Spin and turned it upside down and placed it underneath the armrest and as he was drifting off into that state into that sort of lional state so he didn't go too far into sleep what would happen is that his muscle tone would gradually relax he would release the steel ball bearings they would crash on the saucepan wake him up and then he would start to write down all of the ideas that he was having from that linal state oh you said saucepan saucepan sorry that's why no no that's okay but uh very so what made a it made a a a metal sauce underneath you know or a water pale whatever it was and it would crash that wake him up and then he would write down these ideas so interesting and in fact if you look at his house which is preserved um historical you can walk around and he had nap Cuts installed in his house so he could go into different rooms and take naps in these little cuts for his genius brilliant isn't it it is brilliant sorry I didn't mean to interrupt but it was out of enthusiasm I I mean I I don't want to um like give too much detailed information about Rick's working environment but yet let's just say there are a lot of places to lie down and access these these states of mind um and you know it looks like somebody just lying there with their eyes closed but there's an extremely active mind in there obviously look at the look at the um productive output of Rick's career is you know it's truly something to behold behold in capital bold underline highlighted letters um but it's so clear to me um based on all the examples you gave the ones that we're kind of batting back and forth now and I think there's a book the title is something like Winston Churchill's nap or something like that that my dad has always talking my dad's a theoretical physicist always talks about napping is so key um to one's ability to come up with novel Solutions um you know I guess uh that napping frequently throughout the day perhaps violates some of the tenants that you um described in the uh episode on napping and caffeine episode three we put I think you we put in guard rails and we put in the protocols to say okay naps under certain circumstances are no bad thing at all and if you're going to do it here are the suggested guidelines as to exactly how you optimize naps with a protocol um but it is I think it's very worthwhile to just appreciate exactly how complex sleep is in terms of what it's doing for information processing and if you to ask me look what's the the take-home of this final section I think it's no one has ever told you Andrew you really need to stay awake on a problem they've told you that you should sleep now many times on a problem go to sleep yeah sleep on a problem and what's interesting is that in every language that I've inquired about today from you know English to Swahili that phrase sleeping on a problem or something like it very much exist I think the Spanish someone was telling me is translated is you have a conversation with your pillow which I thought was lovely what I also was struck by a fellow who was um French said you in in England you say you you sleep on a problem well the French translation is much closer to you sleep with a problem and I thought that's much so much about the Romantic difference between the beautiful French and the the Eng you know you sleep on a problem ver as you sleep with a problem yes I agree I I think um not only does it have more romantic Notions but but I like it because it there's a a um a symbiotic aspect to you know sleeping with the problem there's kind of a meshing with the challenge in a way that um isn't as uh combative like this thing that's Weighing on you you go to sleep with and you're supposed to wake up and and feel like you've solved it like Eureka right push down on it rather than it's elaboration with sleep rather than a demand from it but I also think it's you know I make that notion about language translation and maybe a slight joke but what it also tells me is this that that phenomenon of sleep dependent creativity transcends cultural boundaries it is common across the globe it's a universal phenomenon why well because sleep is a universal phenomenon not just even in humans but in almost every species that we've studied carefully to dat as you uh described the um the the French notion of sleeping with a problem I think um what the that comes to mind is that perhaps the the idea is um if you're going to sleep with a problem that um you should be the big spoon and they should be the little spoon as opposed as opposed to the problem being the big spoon and you're kind of wrapped in the problem maybe the the problem needs to mesh with you but maybe I'm taking this this IM a little too far"}
{"question": "Is stress a primary trigger for overeating and binge eating, and how does the opioid system play a role in this relationship?", "doc_id": "ulHrUVV3Kq4_8", "video_id": "ulHrUVV3Kq4", "video_title": "Dr. Elissa Epel: Control Stress for Healthy Eating, Metabolism & Aging | Huberman Lab Podcast", "video_header": "Stress, Overeating, Craving & Opioid System", "segment_idx": "8", "time_start": "37:40", "time_end": "48:49", "context": "talk about the relationship between stress and eating and I think that's also a great opportunity for us to talk about the opioid system a lot of people are familiar with the so-called um opioid epidemic and opioid crisis um you know sadly you know far too many people are dying a feny overdose and we all know about the oxy conton epidemic and all these people addicted to opioids and um that's not really what this is about um what we're about to talk about is the fact that we have an opioid system within us that is neurons and other cell types that can red excuse me can release substances into our brain and body that make us feel less pain and make us feel sedated but at a healthy level right and yet there are a lot of things besides drugs that can activate this opioid system um I think sex activates the endogenous opioid system as far as I I last read there was a paper out recently but also food can do it um and again to healthy levels um provided the context is healthy of course what is the relationship between stress and eating and eating and the opioid system stress and eating is an interesting one so most people when they feel stressed or you know I'm just going to ask you do you eat more or less when you're stressed less definitely I feel like I can go two three days without food when I'm when I'm really stressed but I came up in a profession where um sadly for me all nighters were part of the regular until pretty recently a couple years ago when I just called an end to that um and no it wasn't just because of procrastination it was just work overload um but I can go a long period of time without eating although I love to eat mhm uh so I do point out that I do love to eat and what does the body feel like when you're in that stress State when you're not even hungry you're kind of shut down in your digestion that I have enough energy from my neural resources from adrenaline and generally those periods of time when I'm not hungry coincide with a uh hyperfocus on the stressor the deadline whatever it is in life that that needs tending to and um food just doesn't appeal to me as much it doesn't taste as good and it's not as enticing yeah so we think that your type of um body temperament is high sympathetic and so when you have a big stress response your digestion is is pretty much shut down like it's would be the opposite eating would be the opposite of what your body is telling you to do I should I'm just going to forgive me for interrupting uh for those of you hearing sympathetic we're we're not talking about sympathy we're talking about the the sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system which is the so-call fight ORF flight arm as opposed to the parasympathetic in any event sorry to interrupt but want to make sure that um sometimes people hear sympathy and then they think emotional sympathy um I like to think I have that too but um okay so I so I tend to lean more towards the sympathetic meaning um more alertness arousal yeah on the Seesaw of the autonomic nervous system and I I'm a High um sympathetic Rector I lose weight when I go through like writing my dissertation I look like a skeleton at the end um but that's not what most people complain about it's not weight loss most people complain about overeating or binge eating when they're emotional when they're stressed and so that's the more common pattern and what that that looks different both in the brain and biologically and so what it looks like is that the stress response is driving cravings and also let's say high insulin or an an insulin resistance State and what goes along with that is tending to be over away or have obesity and so just by whe whether it's through conditioning or genetics having that kind of larger body with a big stress eating temperament that is a challenge in life and I've been you know I've worked with people with different eating conditions Eating Disorders Bing eating and it is a um what's hard about it is number one it's very common and normative to just feel like you can't feel safe iated so it's this compulsive eating tendency that stress brings you to and so the so what it mean we measure this it's very easy to measure it means that people feel like um they can't control their eating they don't get full um they think about food a lot and so stress kind of exacerbates that tendency and that is a you know it's a it's a common phenotype like we've studied it and maybe 50% of people with obesity have that um do lean people have that some not many like less than 20% but what they also have is this tremendous kind of uh diet what we call dietary strand or control over their eating so they're they are able to to um not overeat even though they're thinking about food a lot so that's that is you know that explains that unusual body of someone who's really more um still has those compulsive traits so why does this matter this makes it really hard to eat well because when you're stressed you're D you're craving the comfort food the high fat high sugar high salt uh depending on your temperament and that is that means with repeated bouts of stress you're just going to be gaining weight and particularly in the intraabdominal area that's what we've seen we've seen it cross-sectionally we've seen it in Rat studies and mice studies and now we've seen it in people in many St for about 10 years I studied this and the question was is what's happening in people people the same thing that's happening in mice if you stress them out and you give them Oreos the mice develop binge eating they get really compulsive and they get this you know terrible metabolic Health profile metabolic syndrome where they're they're round you know their in their belly fat basically expands like a cushion and that's because that's this really good immediate source of energy during stress so like we're really well-wired to if our body thinks we're under chronic stress we're going to store stress fat or abdominal fat so we can mobilize that in a second and then the second question we've asked is can you reverse that with different interventions can you can you block the compulsive eating um so I can I can tell you what we found there but the opioid system that you mentioned is certainly involved and in studies with um people lean people and people with obesity my colleague Raji sinat yel it's basically found that when you stress them out people with obesity are having a different reward response and they're having they're the more insulin resistant they are the more their Reward Center lights up during stress and what's causal there like what's the chicken what's the egg so because I can imagine these were people that at one time were not obese who got stressed um the opioid system reacted in a particularly uh potent way to food and they were able to clamp their stress and so then they become or binge eaters in the context of stress yeah um and that leads to insulin insensitivity exactly I could also imagine that they were insulin and sensitive therefore they need to eat more in order to feel kind of an increase in uh satiety because we know this um now uh B based on brain and body mechanisms and then that set off a Cascade of things leading to obesity um not that it necessarily matters but what's causal do we know if I think it really does matter I think there's been a you know a mistake of kind of confounding all obesity with food addiction and um and metabolic disease and it's completely heterogenous so I I think it's the developmental path that you're describing which is that um there's a tendency toward having bigger reward response and hunger during stress so it becomes a way of coping a lifestyle and and that is a pathway toward obesity and so some obese people have a disregulated stress response but I but not all of them I mean it really is a certain type of person so that's why we target people with Cravings in all of our intervention studies now we want to know who has more of the compulsive eating type because they need a different set of skills to cope with stress and to lose weight if that's their goal there's a drug I'm sure you're familiar with nxone which is can block the opioid receptor it's used to block the opioid receptor in the context of different types of addiction have people tried to use ultraone in the context of binge eating and does it help people lose weight because it presumably reduces some of the rewarding properties of of food that's one of the very few drug combinations that has been used for Bing eting so it was a combination of nxone and Wellbutrin and I'm not sure at this moment how much um that's favored for Bing eating but certainly the early trials showed that it it really does damp down on the compulsive eating interesting so is that a commonly prescribed uh kit of drugs now for for obesity I know there's a lot of excitement nowadays about these semaglutide yeah um analoges because they do seem very effective in blocking hunger especially in type two diabetics I don't know if you're familiar with but right there s of all the rage um mostly because people saw the before and after photos of Elon he had his shirt off on a boat and there were some not so nice comments made about him and then sometime later he was quite a bit lighter and um he announced that he had been taking one of these semaglutide agonists yeah yeah I really hope that we come up with um safe and effective drugs and one thing to think about is that the the challenge that we all have um particularly if we're prone to obesity is the toxic food environment and particularly the refined sugar and regardless of what we're on Metformin or one of these drugs we override it with our diet and and really the improved nutrition is the only way to solve it as a public health problem I mean the drug companies are saying everyone should be you know everyone with a certain BMI should be on one of these new drugs and it's just rubbish and it's not going to lead to long-term Health well I I know you have a colleague there at UCSF um Dr Robert lustig who's been talking about sugars and hidden sugars for years and the problems with that and and we don't want to demonize sugar is the only cause of the Obesity epidemic but it's certainly one of them at least that that's my belief to the data yes and and Rob is the biggest proponent of you know of helping people understand the big problem in the root is in the processed food and the sugar and that the drugs don't touch that we just we override effects of any drugs with our diet and and so it's um it's been a a losing battle really because of the force of big food and big Pharma so let me go"}
{"question": "How can I promote a healthy gut microbiome and support weight loss through dietary and lifestyle changes?", "doc_id": "K4Ze-Sp6aUE_13", "video_id": "K4Ze-Sp6aUE", "video_title": "Dr. Layne Norton: The Science of Eating for Health, Fat Loss & Lean Muscle", "video_header": "Gut Health & Appetite", "segment_idx": "13", "time_start": "1:08:07", "time_end": "1:16:18", "context": "and talk about gut health, because up until now, and certainly-- LAYNE NORTON: I see what you did with that pun. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And certainly in the last few minutes, we've been talking a lot about top-down processes. The brain, the psychology, placebo effects, but the very real aspects of those, not that I can imagine 2,000 calories, 1,000 calories and somehow change the law of thermodynamics. Can't do that. But we've been top-down in integrating a lot of different ideas into weight loss maintenance and weight gain. But gut health, at least the more popular studies on gut health, have blown a lot of things out of the water. For instance, this idea that you could take obese mice and literally give them fecal transplants from lean mice, and yes, that sounds like what it sounds like. Fecal transplants definitely inserted through the same end in which it comes out. And I point that out because a lot of people have asked me that they-- and it was kind of scary to me, I thought, yes, this is not about ingesting feces, this is-- they literally do a transplant of these from lean mice into obese mice and the obese mice get lean. And yes, this has been done in humans. Limited number of studies and observed some pretty impressive effects on weight loss that I have to assume could be related to placebo effect. They might have told these obese people, hey, look, you're going to get lean through this fecal transplant from lean people. But more likely, it had some effect on their core physiology. I don't know which aspects although, I can speculate which ones. And they became leaner. They lost weight. And that is, in some sense, miraculous, especially given the important role of psychology and exercise and satiety signals, because I'm going to assume that they controlled for a number of those other variables, although no study is perfect. What are your thoughts about gut health as it relates to metabolism, energy utilization, and balance? LAYNE NORTON: Yeah. So the first thing I'll say is I'm not a gut health expert, but I will-- I feel relatively comfortable talking about it based on conversations I've had with people who are experts-- one being Suzanne Devkota who's-- you're familiar with her? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, she's sort of a phenom in this area from what I understood. LAYNE NORTON: So she was actually doing her masters when I was doing my PhD in Lehman's lab. So she was one of my lab mates. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Terrific. LAYNE NORTON: And the other thing to say is, even gut health experts, and Suzanne will tell you this, they're like, talk to me in 20 years. We just know so little. I think that's an overall thing that people don't understand is the scientific consensus moves very, very slow, probably for good reason. Because if we just flipped our scientific consensus based on one study, I mean, it would be a mess. So it's going to take time before we really understand the implications of the gut and what it means. So when it comes to weight loss, there probably is a role in there. I mean, we've seen that there's something going on. Now, whether that's-- is it something where a gut microbiome make makeup that's more obese resistant, perhaps, it extracts less calories out of the food you eat. Or perhaps, it's elevating BMR. Although, I think that that's probably somewhat unlikely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Do you think it could impact the way satiety signals are? LAYNE NORTON: So that's-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: I mean, back to the brain again. LAYNE NORTON: --so that's-- we know that there's a link in the gut brain axis. And so my suspicion is that it probably is working via appetite regulation. So I mean, if we look at the most effective obesity treatments out there, which is like semaglutide, I mean, you consistently see a 15% on average loss of body weight, which is massive and people keep it off. That is a GLP-1 mimetic which is a gut hormone. And it, basically, just is a very, very powerful appetite suppressant. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I guess I'm interrupting, but hopefully, with a purpose. There's this really interesting study. And it's in mice, admittedly, but published in a neuroscience journal recently. And basically, the takeaway is that like so many things in neuroscience, the GLP-1 works in two parallel pathways. In the brain, it seems to impact neurons in the hypothalamus that control satiety. So exactly what you're saying. And in the gut, it seems to create an activation of the mechanosensors in the gut. So the perception is that the gut is full even-- or fuller. I should say, not full, because I think people who take semaglutide don't feel bloated. I don't know, they might. But that one feels as if their gut is actually fuller because these mechanical sensors that send-- stretch are sending signals to the brain, oh, I actually have some food. I'm not empty down there. LAYNE NORTON: Right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Anyway, I'm tickled by this result mostly because every time I hear about a drug or a molecule having an effect, we think it has an effect at one location. But it's kind of interesting that, especially for something like appetite regulation, that it would be impacting body and brain in parallel. Anyway, forgive me. LAYNE NORTON: That's great. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You can tell I'm really excited about this. And here you are telling a neuroscientist, me, that a lot, perhaps, circles back to these brain mechanisms of satiety. LAYNE NORTON: Yeah. I mean, I think that-- and especially looking at the research on leptin, you we used to think, OK, metabolism is mostly like liver-based and then there's metabolism in the adipocyte and skeletal muscle. But none of this stuff exists in isolation. There's so much crosstalk between these pathways. And that's-- when we get into mechanisms-- though one of the things I love mechanisms. But one of the things I tell people is keep in mind that when you're dealing with an outcome, like when I say outcome-based, we're talking about physical outcomes like weight loss, fat loss, changes in blood markers, whatever, though that is the summation of thousands of different mechanisms. So sure, sometimes, you can affect a mechanistic pathway, and you get straight down the line outcome, but not always. Whenever you make a treatment or anything into the system, it's like throwing a pebble in a lake. It creates ripples. And we don't always know what those are going to be. And that's why-- I mean, we've seen certain drugs, what works on this pathway. And then they list off all the side effects. And you go, well, how would it create that many side effects? Because nothing-- for the most part, they don't just work in one place. There's multitude of places it works. And to your point about semaglutide and the effects on mechanical sensors, it's probably why a lot of people report actually low grade nausea when they're using semaglutide. Because of that. Because if you're-- that feeling is usually not like a real comfortable feeling, but I mean, it will get you to not eat. So I think there's absolutely likely a connection, but we haven't fully elucidated how that works. And we think about how complicated the gut is. I think I heard something like there's more cells in our microbiome by far than there are in our body. So we're actually more-- in terms of a cell per cell level, we're actually more bacteria than we are eukaryote. ANDREW HUBERMAN: There's Justin Sonnenburg who's one of the world experts on microbiome. He's in the lab upstairs from mine at Stanford. And he has this idea-- it's just an idea that because we are indeed more bacteria than we are cells, the question is, who's the host and who's the passenger? LAYNE NORTON: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Maybe, we are just-- maybe they're exploiting us to take them around and interact, because they interact and grow on one another. And so this idea that this freaks people out, Lex Fridman will love this. That maybe human beings are just actually the vehicles for the microbiome and not the other way around. Anyway, kind of a scary thought. Do you do anything specifically to support your gut microbiome?"}

Chris Voss: Andrew. Pleasure, man. Andrew Huberman: I've been wanting to talk to you on record for a while. You are quite what we call in science \"N-of-one,\" when somebody is a true sample size of one. I realize that, yes, you are, because you have this incredible skill set from your time in the FBI, but you also have an incredible understanding and knowledge of how to communicate about that skill set so that people can glean useful information from it. You are also the guy that I text or call every once in a while when I've run myself into a jam or when I think I might be in a jam. And I won't reveal details, but you tell me whether or not things are okay. And fortunately, the last couple of times I reached out, you said, you're good. So thank you. Chris Voss: Always happy to help, man. Andrew Huberman: Thank you. Well, I have a lot of questions today, but what I'd like to start off talking about is negotiations take many forms, but if we could break those down into their broad categories, that will be useful. But before we do that, I want to know about the mindset that you have when you go into a negotiation and whether or not there are any sort of practices. I realize you've been in this profession a long time, and so it perhaps became reflexive to you at some point. But all of us at some point are going to go into negotiations, business negotiations, relationship negotiations, etc. Is there a process of getting one's mind and body right for a negotiation, shifting from more listening and less talking? Are there any tools that you use on the regular that could be useful for us to keep in mind as we extend into the different categories of negotiations and ways to approach those negotiations? Chris Voss: There can be a couple of different, first of all, just trying to figure out what's really going on is the real issue, and then how can I get an approach where I'm most likely to get the best possible outcome? So there's always more than meets to eye, and there's a certain few cliches, but the real issue is there's always a better deal or there's no deal at all. So first of all, my first thing is I want to find out whether or not there's a deal at all or whether or not it's a bad deal. And then I'm going to walk away really fast because those are going to be a complete waste of time. It's not a sin to not get the deal. That's a sin to take a long time to not get the deal, or it's a sin to take a long time to get a bad deal. So I want to know. I'm going to try to figure out real quick whether or not, is there a cutthroat on the other side of the table? Is it somebody I could trust? I'm leaning a little more inclined to dealing with the difficult people now, as long as I don't give in. So I want to diagnose early on what the possibilities are. Now, if I'm curious, if I'm actually interested now, another aspect of the mindset is if I'm in a great mood, if I'm just going to be playful, a couple of really huge personal negotiation wins recently was when I was just trying to be playful. I mean, I was in a great mood and I'm joking around. And great negotiation is not exciting. It's astonishing. We're in conversations right now with a possible nonscripted TV show. And so I was telling the producers, this ain't going to be \"Real Housewives\" to make this show properly. There ain't going to be any screaming. It's not going to be \"Bar Rescue,\" where we're yelling at people. We're not going to be \"Hell's Kitchen,\" where we're yelling at people. It's never going to be exciting, but it is going to be astonishing. You'll get outcomes where suddenly you find yourself in a place like, what in the world? How did that just happen? And so I lose a suitcase in an airport the other day, and I'm walking into the lost luggage place and I'm in a great mood because I'm home and I'm happy to be home and I'm going to get a good night's sleep. And even though it's late in the day, I'm just happy. And I get ready to walk into the lost luggage store where these people are battered children. They know that you expect them to wave a magic wand and poof, your luggage is going to be there. So for whatever reason, and that's what I say when I walk in the door, this young lady says, how can I help you? Well, first of all, how you could help me is obvious because I'm in a lost luggage. There's only one reason I'm in here. So that's kind of a silly question. And I go, I need you to wave a magic wand. And she just laughs and she looks at me. She ends up walking me out to the carousel. Climbing up on the carousel, and she walks down a ramp. The luggage comes out of, and I guarantee you they're not supposed to do that. And she sticks her head in, she looks around, she comes back out, and I've never seen any of these people leave the office, let alone walk back to the carousel. And she says, wait here. And she disappears into the bowels of the airport, which looks like a superhighway down there, right? Like, God knows what it looks like underneath the airport. And pretty soon, the carousel starts up again, and my bag. And another bag pops out. This other poor schmuck is sitting there waiting, and I'm like, I have never seen anybody do this, ever. Normally they say, here's a number. We'll call you in 24 hours. It might show up at your house. And I look around at the ... there's another young lady there. And I say, please tell her thank you for me. I got to go. Because she doesn't come back out for, like, almost ten minutes. And on my way out, she comes out the door, and she high-fives me, and she says, \"how's that for waving a magic wand?\" And that was the magic phrase. And I never would have said it to her if I wasn't playful in a moment. And I've got a couple of others, like, when I was just playful, and I'm joking with people almost at my expense. It's shocking. Astonishing what you can get people to do if you hit them the right way. Andrew Huberman: So interesting. I wonder what it tapped into. But it sounds like it might have tapped into her sense that everybody's always asking me for a magic wand kind of ability, but finally somebody just said it directly, and that would be kind of fun to actually play that role, because normally they're restricted to their keyboard and their phone. I love that. On the opposite side of that spectrum, if ever you're feeling tense, stressed,"}

{"question": "What are some strategies or techniques that can help cultivate detachment and improve decision-making by taking a step back and assessing priorities?", "doc_id": "__RAXBLt1iM_21", "video_id": "__RAXBLt1iM", "video_title": "Jocko Willink: How to Become Resilient, Forge Your Identity & Lead Others | Huberman Lab Podcast 104", "video_header": "Detachment: Problems & Perspective", "segment_idx": "21", "time_start": "2:50:24", "time_end": "2:55:52", "context": "I don't know what people's perceptions of me are. I actually try not to spend too much time thinking about that and just really try and stay in touch with the source. And I really do believe in this notion that our love of things is what can generate energy. And I try and use action to generate energy but also I happen to also love exercise. So that's an easy one there for me. But I try and stay in that mode. But to be quite honest, I've spent much of my adult life and probably too much of my teenage life and 20s-- you're not quite an adult in your 20s, at least I certainly wasn't-- in challenging relationships that admittedly were challenging because of my role in them also, of course. And each and every time, I remember thinking, moving on from this is like this insurmountable thing. In part because I am a caretaker, and I cared. And it wasn't just about me and a selfishness, it was about wanting to right all the wrongs of that person's past. I found myself trying to be a time machine for people. I found myself trying to fix their family lives. I found myself doing all of that and also ignoring all the things I need to focus on in terms of bettering myself and making sure I was showing up correct and on and on. And there are data in the world in the form of these people that know me very, very well that I think would say that and a whole lot more. The point isn't those specific relationships but each and every time someone would come along and say, listen, if this isn't good for you, it's not good for them, or this is a bad situation, or this isn't serving either of you well. But I was myopic, this big. And not even soda straw view of the world like sand speck of the world and trying to solve because that's my nature. I'm going to solve this. I'm going to solve it. I'm going to solve it. And sometimes things were solved for some period of time and sometimes they weren't. And I think one thing that just as a confessional, I will say, I could really learn the art of detachment. I could really learn to focus on that more, if that's the proper language for it. I think I'm pretty good at adapting. I think I'm pretty good at finding good people. I'm certainly love my team, and that all feels like natural synergy although it's hard work in lab and in the podcast. But I think the tendency that I have as a problem solver is to assume that every problem can be solved, and therefore, staying on this problem until it is solved is the answer. And maybe the art of detachment and getting some perspective would help because if I look back, I certainly don't regret the experiences that I've had. But I wasted far too much time. And frankly, I probably wasted far too much of other people's time trying to solve problems that could not be solved. And I think without going into this in any more detail, and of course, you can send me a bill at the end by the way. I think-- JOCKO WILLINK: Confessions sessions are free, man ANDREW HUBERMAN: --yeah. So I think that being a problem solver is great, being forward center mass is great. I think learning the systems of the brain and body and understanding psychology and learning about oneself. The Oracle had it right, know thyself in ways that you can maneuver functionally in your life and career and relationship, et cetera. Great. But I think there's also a downside to being overly fixated. It's like my bulldog, Costello, used to be like chewing on something, chewing on something. Next thing I know he's chewing on his foot. And you're like, hey. And you'd have to rip him off his own foot. He'd be like-- --because that chew reflex was just so strong that sometimes it would turn on himself. That's how it feels. JOCKO WILLINK: Yeah, I wrote a book called Leadership Strategy and Tactics. And one of the things that I wrote about in that book is understanding what's important and what's not. And this is very similar to what you're talking about. Looking at a problem and taking a step back. And going, well, A, is this important or not? And B, is this solvable or is it not? And C, what's the ROI on getting it solved? And what's the effort it's going to take to get this problem solved? And how much is it really going to impact my world and my life if I focus on it? So knowing and understanding when something is important or not is a very good skill. And again, it's a skill that's directly related to detachment. Because when you're in that relationship-- this is another thing I've been telling people lately-- the solution to your problem is not going to be found in the problem. It's not going to be found in there. You have to get out of the problem so that you can look at it, make an assessment. And you can assess how to solve the problem or whether you need to solve the problem or not. I mean, there's a lot of things in my life right now where I shrug my shoulders and go, OK. But-- It's OK. Oh, someone's saying this, OK. Roger that. Carry on. No factor. Move on. And then occasionally, you go, OK, this is something I need to contend with. This is something I need to deal with this. This is something I need to shape or adjust or move or solve, to use your word. The reason I laugh when I say that is because problems you have to get in there. But if you take a step back, you can usually say, oh, a little adjustment here, a little adjustment there, and that thing is going to sort itself out. So detachment is a superpower. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Certainly is and it certainly one that I need to focus on more. I'm grateful for you bringing that up. This is the biologist in me, but what is your process for engaging detachment or for disengaging?"}

well right right and um and I'm not disparaging that it's just that we we have sort of a dilution of deeper understanding of what these things really are and aren't um what are your thoughts I realize you're not a psychiatrist but what are your thoughts on the idea that um many uh people that think they perhaps have true attention issues have either um built those attention issues through neuroplasticity um uh into their system meaning their system probably worked nervous system probably worked pretty well to focus but they engaged in enough task switching that the circuits of the brain involved in cognition became optimized for um this very distributed cognition um as opposed to um narrow focused attention and what are your thoughts about um just the amount of of stimulant use on college campuses and in in adult populations to to try and overcome this I feel like there's a lot of um attempts to use pharmacology to match the level of distraction to try and make that distraction not seem like distraction but you know this is uh this is an area I hear a lot about given the nature of the things I cover on the podcast I think a lot of these issues are phone induced right um and and I think the problem is yeah not solvable as much you don't need pills you need a different phone relationship my optimistic hypothesis is again this uh non-clinical uh difficulty with maintaining attention like in your work or if you're a college student or whatever um it's not necessarily representing sort of knock on wood like a wholesale neural rewiring like that I basically rewired my circuits on my brain to be a sort of distributed switching processor I think most of this is is persisting um in that much more malleable area that gets affected by moderate behavioral addictions right so the the we we have parts of the brain that are part of these like feedback reward Loops that's meant to be malleable right I mean this is supposed to be so we can have really rapid learning about what's happening in our environment how we're supposed to respond to it and and this is what gets hijacked when you you build up these behavioral addictions and so it's it's very quick to change um but that malleability means you can change it back right so so I I I think this this drive to I have to keep checking my email or my phone is again you build up a moderate behavioral addiction because of like standard reward cues and and that's a part of the brain that you can't it's difficult but it's not your whole brain is now a social media brain and that's just the brain you have because you're exposed to this um it's a matter of you know getting the stimuli out of your life doing the same type of training you would do uh ex boredom exposure like get used to the idea of feeling that drive and not actually doing it you can work with blocking apps like there's stuff you can do this is sort of like standard it's painful it takes two months and then like you're doing better on it so I do think we have a a a large stratum of subclinical attention issues that are not representing wholesale neural rewirings but are like absolutely sort of expected outcomes of working with malleable reward CU circuits in the brain we can fix those just like we can if you know you're you're uh you're gambling too much or compulsively eating the junk food or something we don't say your whole brain got we red for junk food it's like no you have this ex this particular Q cycle that we have to work on so maybe I'm being optimistic there and you know the brain better but like it would be extraordinary if in like a 10-year period right your entire brain somehow got rewired in a way that it couldn't sustain Focus anymore I totally agree with that statement unless uh you're a young person and you grew up in a distracted world and your brain optimized as the young brain does for the conditions it's in and then I think you have a real issue yeah um which is not to say it can't be rescued through the use of discipline tools protocols pharmacology nutrition great sleep and if necessary prescription drugs right because there is a case for prescription drugs in certain um instances for ADHD and and as I understand it um you know anytime people say wait aren't those drugs just meth isn't it just speed yep they are amphetamines in most cases and the idea is to increase the deployment of C certain neuromodulators ones I mentioned before um as a means to induce neuroplasticity so that the focus state becomes more of a default state um so I think that young people are in trouble I think that we I do worry about young people I think we it's um it's akin to putting them in a kind of a well we know this in the visual system if you take an animal or human and you put them into an altered visual environment um the visual system changes and your perception of the visual world is becomes inaccurate um and the way I think of this cognitively with respect to attention the analogy would be I think we've been for the last 10 years or so 10 15 years we've been raised in kids in a sort of um House of uh fun house mirror things which is anything but fun where you look at yourself and your legs are shorter than and your torso is long and so everywhere you turn you're getting a distorted perception and trying to navigate the world through that distorted perception is very very difficult you can do it but it's a lot of extra work that's what I feel we've done to young people I'm I'm very concerned about that as well yeah yeah and and I think I don't know what your take on this but like do you think at the undergraduate level that we have just been not explicitly but just sort of implicitly uh professors in general we have been just sort of slowly adapting the difficulty of what we're teaching Etc because we maybe there's a reduced cognitive Focus capacity which is like the key skill for this sort of very artificial thing of learning you know complicated college level work I think this would be an interesting experiment to find out is have we been implicitly having to sort of simplify things to keep roughly speaking distributions where normatively we feel comfortable I mean do we see the signal yet that's my interest do we see the signal yet if we look back a generation 20 years ago versus now I don't know for courses of the sort that I teach or taught until very recently I still teach but I was directing the neuron Anatomy course and there's a laboratory module so the students dissect brains they're holding actual human brains um that's a real physical contact that cannot be recapitulated um digitally you just can't do it you can try you use VR but it's it ain't the same I mean how would you like it if you're a neurosurgeon learned um on a virtual brain and then it does surgery on a brain no not no such thing should uh happen I think that um my experience with this is perhaps most relevant with respect to social media where I teach

They're haploid. They have either an X or a Y sex chromosome as the 23rd so-called sex chromosome. And as we all know, they have a head. The head tends to be oval in most cases. The head contains very important enzymes and proteins that are designed to fuse with the much larger egg and to actually take the membrane of the sperm cell and combine to actually mesh with the egg cell's membrane and then deliver the genetic contents to the egg cell, in other words, to fertilize the egg cell. Now, just behind the head is a region called the mid region. That mid region is a slightly thickened region. And here, of course, I'm talking about healthy sperm cell morphology. Morphology simply means shape. A mid region-- that mid region has a bunch of things related to cell motility and to the forward progression of the cells. First of all, it is chock a block full of mitochondria. In fact, if you were to look just behind the head of the sperm, what you'd see is that it is completely surrounded by mitochondria. There are mitochondria elsewhere in the cell, but most of them are contained in this mid region compartment just behind the head of the sperm. And that thick region is where the tail movement of the sperm, the flagellation back and forth, is actually generated from. Much like if you were to hold a rope, like a battle rope in the gym, and you were to whip the battle rope, the whip at the one end of the rope is what allows for the sort of-- let's just call it what it is-- the curves in the rope, the oscillations, the rising and falling of the rope all the way out to the end. It is the force of the whip right at that end that with the battle rope you're doing with your hand-- and with the sperm, that is occurring just behind the head of the sperm-- that is actually going to dictate how fast and how well that sperm can swim. And indeed, the sperm has to swim very far. How far? Well, on a relative scale-- and again, these are estimations because they're going to be-- how should we say? There will be differences in the distance from the head of the penis and where the ejaculation occurs to the cervix, depending on the relative size of the vaginal canal and the penis that delivers the ejaculate to the vaginal canal. But once the sperm arrive at the cervix, which is at the back of the vaginal canal just at the opening to the uterus, once the sperm arrive there, the distance from the cervix to the egg, of course, will vary depending on where that egg is in its ovulatory trajectory, its pathway. But it is akin, if you scale for size, to the distance between Los Angeles and San Francisco, which is many, many hundreds of miles. So those sperm have to swim very far. Now, of course, if the sperm are delivered in the vaginal canal somewhat further away, they will have further to go. If they're delivered right at the cervical opening, they will have less far to go. The very effective swimming sperm swim very fast. So they are able to accomplish that distance in just a few days. And this relates to a discussion that we will get into in a lot more detail later as to how often couples should have intercourse if they're trying to conceive. Many people might think, well, it's every day. However, the more frequent the ejaculation, the lower the concentration of sperm in each ejaculate. So this is not a discussion about how often to have intercourse depending to your preferences, for pleasure or bonding or whatever reason. This is a discussion about how often to have intercourse in order to optimize the probability of fertilization of the egg. There's some general rules that, of course, come to mind, which is ejaculations close to ovulation-- both before, during, or sometimes after-- are obviously advantageous. But you will also hear OB/GYNs and urologist suggesting intercourse every other day leading up to the day of ovulation, starting about three to four days out from the day of ovulation.

uh Ultra performers in all domains on a pedestal I I think um they're in a very precarious place inside and outside they've essentially given up all their power and agency to one incoming failure and maybe they never experience it and they get to the end without having know but what what a terrible way to live anyway I I've always looked up since I was little too people that really um took a unique path I've always found that um they yes accomplish tremendous things and and they have um interesting sometimes painful flaws like I I'm a huge fan of of the late neurologist and writer Oliver Sachs very very incredible man very complicated life you know if you read his books his autobiography which I highly recommend everybody um do if you're interested in science um and just animals and and a a a life uniquely lived he's a really good example and there a bunch of other examples that are meaningful to me um certainly not somebody who you know he couldn't do an experiment to save his life he was um moved out of multiple universities and places you know a very very complicated character had a methamphetamine addiction um was a closet homosexual it came out later in life and was then long periods of time on his own and anyway had a great relationship later in life um very interesting um person uh became that way and found his Passion by realizing how terrible he was at certain things including certain branches of medicine so I think that trying many things and being really realistic about whether or not something's for us or not but uh is the key but then I guess the question becomes and this must be so hard from the perspective of parenting but also just in terms of guiding ourselves through life is you know how much friction do we experience before we say you know what like I'm not a musician and I'm cool with that I love music but I'm going to put my efforts into these other things and you know this thing comes more easily for me that you know I do think we have a lot of natural tendencies and I feel like especially in the United States there's been this complicated relationship with parenting and education whereby we we don't want to push people to their own you know like suffering and demise but we also have to avoid not pushing them because then they don't ever find what they are proficient in and they don't learn that overcoming friction thing um so it's It's Tricky I do believe everyone has a unique expression of themselves in life whatever that is doesn't have to be in professional life but you to try a lot of different things and you know how at what point you uh you bail out I mean I've had few in my lab but I've spoken to graduate students in posto where I had to say you know what I actually had this conversation with the post I was like you know what you're a really good scientist you're never going to be a professor let's get you a job in biotech and they were like they thought their whole life they were going to be a professor like you're not and the data are the following which point to that and it's kind of devastating but then years later they thank me or they thanked me in that case yeah a few others probably curs me but so how do you know when to keep pushing your kid to even engage in something like maybe they're the kid that always is picked last for the team but you know they should play sports so I guess my first reaction is I'm I'm reacting to the word pushing cuz I'm not not sure that's the like the verb I would think about because I think the idea of pushing your kid even like how much do I push there's there's a lot about us there is like is that my I guess I grew up in a town where a lot of kids got pushed oh I mean I grew up in a town where every kid got pushed so maybe that's why I know something about it right I mean I think we see this all the time and it goes back to actually what side of the tennis court like whose feelings are who's like is this my unlived dreams as a athlete in my youth or is this actually about my kid soccer skills you know I think parents watching their kids playing sports is a prime example of am I living out my unfulfilled dreams and projecting that onto my daughter or does my daughter like soccer and like how can I really differentiate those right I think actually though making it back to that a lot of this actually goes back to frustration tolerance and why it matters so much to me like my approach to teaching frustration tolerance which is like a Hidden Gem we have here at good inside I really want I I want to be in every school I think it needs to be in every school and I want to describe it to you okay so I I literally have this graph it's helpful and I know you like to write things down to to make it concrete we're like point one is not knowing how to do something okay and point two which is very far away is let's say knowing how to do it or being very proficient this could be soccer I think a good example is reading okay like you everybody starts out not knowing how to read and let's say not everybody but a large a lot of people learn how to read the fr the the the space between not knowing and knowing I call the Learning space it has a name and it's helpful to know where you are in a map and the learning space has one feeling that you're supposed to have frustration that is the feeling you're supposed to have and we have this idea that we sh from not knowing to knowing like this it's because of those damn Star Wars movies and oh no actually Star Wars Incorporated some frustration but it's because of movies boom you're supposed to just have the skill because you picked up the rock or the sword or the the pen or the wand well and now it's because if you think about the circuitry that kids get used to with dopamine and the space between wanting and having in general is low because when you don't know something you want to know it here you do know it our tolerance and our kids tolerance for wanting and not having is so low that what's so sad is the learning space has gotten massively compressed and people fear frustration this image when I've gone over this with kids and even teachers I know teachers who teach us in their class okay today we're going to learn this new thing we're going to learn whatever it is the you know how to read a short word everybody in this class is here not knowing everybody in this class is going to get here and probably today most of us and you can actually do it m are going to be right here what does this say the learning space how are we supposed to feel when we're in the learning space the class can say frustrated okay here's an interesting assignment different than you think the goal today is not to tell me if you can read the letters that are in front of you I want you to raise your hand when you feel frustrated which feels like this oh I can't do it because I'm going to come up to you and I'm going to give you a high five and I'm going to say you are in the learning space you are learning how amazing is that like Andrew I really believe this has like the power to change learning because then when we talk about proficiency or when we talk about years from now my kid is saying this happens all the time I get questions about this all the time my kid says they want to do whatever is it could be a coding class it could be a lacrosse class and they do it once and then they always come home and they say I want to do it I quit or maybe they're on a swim team they want to quit do I let my kid quit right to me the question is actually like most likely none of our kids are going to be Olympic swimmers or like professional basketball players I think about this a lot with orts the whole goal in my mind for most people with orts not everyone but most is learning how to deal with frustration learning how to do things you thought you couldn't do character sharing being a good teammate sportsmanship right all those things are hard skills to learn so the reason I'm signing my kid up for basketball is actually just because it's like a good medium for all those things and so I want to be sure that if my kid is quitting it's not because they're escaping the very very natural learning space that is so important to be in in life and this happened actually my oldest wanted to quit baseball he' played for years and he wanted to quit in in the conversation we ended up having was look let's wait to the end of the season like and this goes back to values it's not we don't quit but like in our family we we really value and try as much as we can to keep our commitments and not just to ourselves to each other and so the rest of the season you might be thinking all the time I don't want to be doing this and again in my head I'm thinking good that's like a good life experience to watch yourself go through that as long as it's not toxic and at the end you know we'll talk talk about it interestingly enough he had the best baseball season he'd ever had he had a grand slam which no shade to baseball that's as exciting as youth baseball ever gets right and still he was like they I'm done like I just want and I felt really good about that I was like look you you you ended on like you're playing really well it wasn't just cuz you got moved down in the batting order like if that's the reason why I K get moved down to the batting order they're not starting on basketball I hear this all the time now they want to quit I don't have any any rigid rules but if that becomes a pattern that worries me or not worries me but forget you sports that's just not a great circuitry that would be conducive with kind of resilience and confidence in adulthood look I love love love

They can increase the likelihood of having herpes cold sore outbreaks on the mouth. The arginine is in the pathway by which I don't know if people know this, but the herpes virus lives on neurons of the trigeminal nerve that innervates the lips and the eyes and the mucus membranes of the face. So this is the herpes type 1 simplex virus. The virus lives on those neurons and then periodically inflames those neurons, and that's what leads to the cold sores seems like arginine and citrulline can lead to increases in cold sores and canker sores, and outbreaks of those kinds. So you want to be aware of that. That's not everybody, and not everybody is caring HSV-1, just be aware that I think it's now 80% or 90% of people by time they're 12 years old, they've contracted HSV-1. It's very contagious and typically one outbreak, and then only under conditions of stress or heightened arginine or citrulline ingestion we'll have them later. Again, this is not necessarily an STI, a sexually transmitted infection. This is an infection that is passed very easily from mucous membranes, just in terms of touching objects and things of that sort. Very common in the general population.

{"question": "How does ketamine's activation of NMDA receptors contribute to the process of neuroplasticity, particularly in relation to learning new motor skills or tasks?", "doc_id":

Neuroplasticity", "segment_idx": "8", "time_start": "34:29", "time_end": "41:31", "context": "how is ketamine really working we already established that ketamine blocks the nmda receptor and that the nmda receptor is critical for many forms not all but many forms of neuroplasticity now I realize some of you might be familiar with so-called ligands and receptors but most of you probably are not a ligand is a chemical that binds to a receptor and a receptor is like a little parking spot on the outside of a cell there can also be receptors inside of cells but most of the time when we're talking about nerve cells neurons and you hear the word receptors you're hearing about receptors on the outside of the cell so the nmda receptor does not exist in our neurons in order to bind ketamine it's there actually to bind all sorts of other things that are endogenous that are naturally made by us but ketamine has a very high what's called Affinity it has a very high probability of binding to the nmda receptor if it's introduced to our bloodstream so when ketamine is taken in pill form sublingual form meaning under the tongue when it's injected into the muscle or the vein it gets into the bloodstream and then it's able to cross easily across the blood-brain barrier the so-called BBB blood-brain barrier the blood-brain barrier keeps a lot of things out of the brain but ketamine can very readily pass across the blood-brain barrier once it's in the brain it has a very high affinity for meaning it knows how to seek out and bind to those nmda receptors now the simplest way to explain how nmda receptors ordinarily contribute to neuroplasticity is that they represent what's called an and gate and an and gate as the name suggests is a function in a cell or in a system where two things have to be present in fact for those of you that have a bit of an engineering or computer programming background you'll be familiar with and gates for those of you that don't don't worry about it I'm going to explain what an and gate is right now an and gate in the context of nervous system function is when two things are present like chemical a and chemical B both have to be present in order for some process say neuroplasticity to occur the nmda receptor as I mentioned earlier is a receptor on the surface of neurons and it binds glutamate which is a molecule that we all make in our brain and it activates other neurons it's what's called an excitatory neurotransmitter now there are lots of different receptors for glutamate and those receptors are binding glutamate all the time however in order to activate the nmda receptor there has to be a lot of glutamate present and it has to happen over a very brief period of time so the nmda receptor is an and gate in the sense that glutamate has to be present and to bind it and it has to get a lot of electrical activity a lot of input in order for that to happen so it's a receptor that responds primarily to unusually high or frequent levels of electrical activity let's place this in real world context so that it makes a bit more sense I like most all of you and moving my arms around a lot throughout the day now as an adult my motor cortex the area of my brain that controls motor coordination of my limbs has connections from my brain to my spinal cord from my spinal cord to my muscles and that's what allows me to move my limbs under conditions of just moving my limbs and doing things throughout the day drinking a cup of coffee or yerba mate you know walking outside to view some sunlight in the morning doing the things that I do every single day and that I already know how to do glutamate is definitely involved in that process glutamate binding to its other receptor types which are called ampa receptors for those of you that want to know that's involved in that process it's typical levels of activity if however I were to sit down at this desk and be commanded to or decide to do some specific motor limb movement let's say move my hand in a three dot sequence for those of you watching you can see this for those of you that are listening don't worry about it it's not very interesting to watch the point is just that I'm going to put my finger down in one two three points on the desk in front of me and then three two one point coming back to me now that's obviously a motor sequence that I can perform I just did it so clearly I can perform it but if I were to do that for let's say an hour what would happen is the neurons that are involved in generating that motor sequence of one two three three two one one two three three two one would be active over and over and over again and what would likely happen because of that unusual frankly motor behavior is that the neurons responsible for generating that motor Behavior would be able to detect it as unusually frequent unusually high levels of activity in the circuits that generate that behavior and the increase in glutamate that's impinging on the neurons in that circuit would bind the nmda receptor making it change several important things the first of which is that your nervous system is capable of changing but that's an energetically demanding process so the incredible thing about neuroplasticity is that when you generate an unusually high or just an unusual pattern of activity motor activity or you're hearing a new language you're trying to learn that or you're navigating a new city the neurons are firing in ways that are atypical for them and they are firing a lot more and so the neurons are going to bind glutamate they the nmda receptor is going to be activated and then Downstream of nmda receptor activation are a bunch of what we call intracellular processes a bunch of things that happen in the cells to try and make that behavior occur again and again if needed but without the huge energetic demand you've experienced this before when you're trying to learn something and it feels sluggish it feels hard it's frustrating and then eventually you learn it and it's very facile it's very easy one of the reasons for that is that when the nmda receptor is activated by these infrequent or unusual patterns of activity it can then recruit other glutamate receptors the more typical kind the ampa type receptors to the cell surface and then those receptors can simply bind the glutamate and allow that behavior to occur without this whole process that's involved in neuroplasticity having to engage and do things like build new proteins in the cell build new Machinery Etc so to just step back from this the way to think about the nmda receptor is that activation of the nmda receptor only occurs under conditions of unusually high or simply unusual patterns of activity that the nmda receptor yes controls neural activity in the immediate sense like when it's activated it's changing the patterns of activity in the neuron sure but it also can engage gene expression and introduce new receptors to the cell basically giving the cell the ability to then recreate the same patterns of activity without having to do it in such a metabolically demanding way in fact a good analogy for all of this is the way that muscles can hypertrophy right if you overload muscles properly through resistance training of any kind and then give them a period of rest there's recruitment of specific things to the muscle fibers as well as recruitment of changes in the nerves that innervate that control the contraction of those muscles and then those muscles grow they get stronger Etc and they are able to function and use that new strength and new growth and you don't have to damage those muscle fibers or trigger those adaptations over and over again to maintain them because you have this new capability now I realize"}

But once they feel that it works for them, each camp seems to tout all the health benefits and how great they feel. Could it be that mindset effects are involved there? That people are finding the nutritional program that they feel brings them the most enrichment of life, but also nutrients. And that their health really is shifting in a positive direction, but not necessarily because of the food constituents, but because of the community, and the ideas and the reinforcement. - Yeah, and the belief that this is the right way of doing something. I think, a hundred percent it has something to contribute. I'm not going to weigh in on the debate. What I will most certainly weigh in on, is the notion that, look going back to the placebo effect, right? We have a outdated understanding of what that is, which is based on this randomized controlled trial, you compare a drug to a placebo. If the drug works better than the placebo, you say, great, the drug works. If the drug doesn't outperform the placebo, you say the drug doesn't work. That's really over simplified. It's a good test for the specific efficacy of the drug. It's not a good test for understanding the total impact of that drug. Because in the reality of things, if a drug outperforms a placebo, then you start prescribing it. But the reality is, that the total effect of that drug, is a combined product of the specific chemical attributes of that drug and whatever's going on in the placebo effect, which is, at least from our perspective, its beliefs, its social context, and it's your body's natural ability to respond to something. So, that's in the placebo effect example. The same is true for everything we do or consume. So when it comes to what diet you're eating, both are true. It does matter what it is and it matters what you think about that diet and what others around you in our culture think about that diet. Because those social contexts inform our mindsets, our mindsets interact with our physiology in ways that produce outcomes that are really important. So let's not get dualistic and say, it's either all in the mind or not in the mind. Let's also not be unnecessarily combative and say, oh, it should be all plant-based or keto or whatever. It's all of those things are a combined product of what you're actually doing, and what you're thinking about. If you believe in it, if you don't, if you're skeptical, or in some cases, you think you should be eating a certain way and then you don't live up to that. It might have even an adverse effect because of the stress and the anxiety associated with that. - Very interesting. Along the lines of belief effects,"}

It's very important in order to have healthy, emotional, and cognitive functioning that we have fairly narrow channels between individual things. If we see something on the news that's very troubling, well, then it makes sense to be very troubled. But if we're troubled by everything and we start just saying, you know, \"Everything is bothering me and I'm feeling highly irritable and everything is just distorting and troubling me.\" Chances are we are not actively removing the meaning, the connectivity between life experiences as well as we could and that almost always maps back to a deficit in REM sleep. So REM sleep is powerful and has this amazing capacity to eliminate the meanings that don't matter. It's not that it exacerbates the meanings that do matter, but it eliminates the meanings that don't matter. And that bears a striking resemblance to what happens early in development. This isn't a discussion about early in development, but early in development the reason a baby can't generate coordinated movements, and the reason why children can get very emotional about what seems like trivial events, or what adults know to be trivial events. Like, \"Oh, the ice cream shop is closed.\" And then the kid just dissolves into, you know, a puddle of tears and the parents say, \"Okay, well, it'll be open again in another time.\" The children one of the reasons that they can't generate coordinated movement, or place that of the ice cream shop being closed into a larger context, is because they have too much connectivity. And much of the maturation of the brain and nervous system that brings us to the point of being emotionally stable, reasonable, rational human beings is about elimination of connections between things. So REM sleep seems to be where we uncouple the potential for emotionality between various experiences. And that brings us to the absolutely fundamental relationship and similarity of REM sleep to some of the clinical practices that have been designed to eliminate emotionality and help people move through trauma and other troubling experiences, whether or not those troubling experiences are"}
{"question": "Can polyamorous relationships effectively balance the desire for sexual variety with the need to manage and potentially suppress feelings of jealousy, and if so, what are some common strategies used by couples to achieve this balance?", "doc_id": "HXzTbCEqCJc_23", "video_id": "HXzTbCEqCJc", "video_title": "Dr. David Buss: How Humans Select & Keep Romantic Partners in Short & Long Term", "video_header": "Non-Monogamy, Unconventional Relationships", "segment_idx": "23", "time_start": "1:46:43", "time_end": "1:53:58", "context": "These days, I don't think it's just by virtue of living in California, you hear more and more about monogamish, as opposed to monogamous, and various forms of polyamory that may or may not include the -amory part. You know, passes and permission, based on seasoned circumstance and prior infidelities, like, okay, somebody had a mishap early on, you know, you have one pass, so to speak, and you hear this kind of language getting thrown around. And it's intriguing to me because it seems like an effort to bypass some of the more, if you will, hardwired, or at least culturally hardwired aspects of mate choice and sexual partner choice. You know, acknowledging jealousy, but confronting it by allowing your partner to be with somebody else, for instance. I confess, I have friends who have unconventional relationships. I have friends with conventional relationships. Any thoughts on the polyamory. - Yeah, I do have a couple of thoughts on it. I haven't studied it extensively, but I think that the way I would phrase it is that there's an attempt to overcome certain evolved features of our mating psychology, but often in the service of other aspects of our mating psychology. So what I mean by that is this. So I talk about polyamory, first of all, there's a sex difference, on average, that is, men are more likely to want to initiate a polyamorous relationship than women. There are lots of exceptions. And I actually know of at least one exception, personally, friends of mine who were in a polyamorous relationship, but the motivation for men is that evolved desire for sexual variety. So it gives him access to a wider variety of sex partners, which is part of our evolved sexual psychology, especially for men. Women, one motivation, women also have a desire for sexual variety, on average tends not to be as great as that of men, but also have it. But some women agree to a polyamorous relationship as a mate retention tactic. That is, this guy in order to keep him, she has to agree to the relationship. And so, the motivations for engaging in polyamory are somewhat sex differentiated. - On average. - On average, on average, there are lots of exceptions. So now when it comes to sexual jealousy, there is this recognition that there, the way that I would frame it, there's this evolved emotion where it triggers sexual jealousy, seeing your partner having sex, or imagining your partner having sex, or falling in love with someone else. And, but interestingly, and there haven't been studies on this, but I know of this one polyamorous couple where they reported to me, both of them reported to me. She said she doesn't, it doesn't bother her at all if her husband, they're married, has sex with other women. They allow it. I think it's like every Thursday night or whatever, different couples that have different rules. But one time she saw him walking down the street, hand in hand affectionately with a former girlfriend and she got extremely jealous. So because it signaled an emotional connection. So the sexual didn't bother her, the emotional did. She happened to be bisexual. And her partner said that it really upset him when she slept with other men, but it was fine if she slept with other women. - I think that's a fairly common thing that among the men that I know that are in polyamorous relationships, that that's a fairly common statement. - Yeah, and so he kept trying these inter-nesting manipulations, trying to encourage her to sleep with other women, but not with men. And in her case, encouraging him not to get emotionally involved with other women, but the sex was okay. So I think that, you know, I think that in the modern environment, we have a very rich and complicated evolved mating psychology. And what we're doing in these novel forms or semi-novel, because these things have a pretty deep history themselves, that we're attempting to maximize some of our evolved desires while keeping quiescent other evolved aspects of our sexual psychology, like jealousy. So satisfying or desire for sexual variety, but keeping jealousy at bay, and different couples do it in different ways, so as you alluded to. So I know one couple live in Los Angeles and the woman, the woman said, she gives her husband permission to have an affair, sleep with other women, as long it's outside of the city limits of LA. And this other couple, it has to be Thursday night, you know, and so different people have different plans. - Putting constraints on, but the constraints are specific and somewhat arbitrary to the relationship. - Yeah, they're specific. And often in polyamorous relationships, people talk it out, and come to an agreement on what is acceptable and what's out of bounds. But in a way, I mean, it, in a way it's just, you know, we can't change our evolved sexual psychology, I don't think. What we can do is we can activate certain elements of it, and keep others quiescent and that's all good. And in a way we do in the modern environment. So even to take it outside of polyamory, pornography, okay, widely consumed internet pornography, what does that do? Well, there's a big sex difference there. Men tend to consume it a lot more than women. The forms of the pornography are different, but in a way, the pornography, what it does is it parasitized men's evolved desire for sexual variety. So they can, in some sense, psychologically experience sexual, a variety of different women sexually without actually doing it, by just looking at their computer screen. And so, in a way, another way of phrasing that, is that we create modern novel cultural inventions in ways that satisfy our evolved desires and our evolved sexual desires. - Yeah, it's interesting with the kind of explosion of online pornography. I have a colleague at Stanford in psychiatry, Anna Lembke, who studies the dopamine system, and she mentioned two things of interest. One is that not only is there a tremendous variety of experiences that are available to people to view in pornography, but the intensity is also quite high, so much so that at least for young people who are observing a lot of pornography, it's possible, and there are studies looking at this now, that their brain circuits become wired to observing sexual acts, as opposed to being engaged in them, which can be extremely problematic. So it's a sharp blade, so to speak this pornography thing. It isn't what it once was, and it's evolving quickly. Very interesting."}

There are a lot of resources there where you can log your food intake, get information about time-restricted feeding all the science, the ongoing studies, et cetera. The other is the so-called Zero app. That makes it very easy to mark when you're beginning your feeding window and when you're ending your feeding window and in, so doing marking when you are beginning your fast and ending or fast, where at least initiating the beginning of the unfed state, as we could more accurately call it, it's a terrific app. I've used it from time to time. I don't tend to use it in an ongoing basis because I'm just sort of used to eating at a particular time of day now. But anytime I've shifted that window, for instance, a few weeks ago, I started moving that protein intake in my entire feeding window earlier in the day. And because that takes some attention on my part, because I'm not used to doing that. I've been using the Zero app and I like it quite a lot. It logs your progress and it gives you averages and you can see how many other people are fasting again, totally zero cost. I actually don't know who owns that app, but I think they've done an excellent job. The interface is really terrific, and as far as I know, it's available for Apple and Android, but it's at least available for Apple phones, which is the type of phone I happen to have.

{"question": "How can custom nootropics like those offered by Thesis help improve focus and concentration in individuals, especially those with specific goals and needs?", "doc_id": "yb5zpo5WDG4_2", "video_id": "yb5zpo5WDG4", "video_title": "Focus Toolkit: Tools to Improve Your Focus & Concentration | Huberman Lab Podcast #88", "video_header": "Thesis, LMNT, Eight Sleep", "segment_idx": "2", "time_start": "5:40", "time_end": "9:34", "context": "is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Thesis. Thesis makes custom nootropics. And to be quite honest, I don't like the word nootropics because the translation of nootropics is smart drugs. And as a neuroscientist, I can tell you there is no neural circuit in the brain for being smart. Rather, there are neural circuits that are responsible for focus, neural circuits for creativity, neural circuits, for task switching and so on and so on. Fortunately, Thesis understands this and has developed custom nootropics that are tailored to your specific goals and your specific needs. They use only the highest quality ingredients, things of the sort that we'll talk about in today's podcast, things like Alpha-GPC, phosphatidylserine, ginko biloba, et cetera. However, I should mention that they are customized to you. So you can go to Thesis, take a brief quiz, and you can get a nootropic starter kit that will allow you to try various nootropics and determine which ones you like and work for you and which ones don't. I've been using Thesis nootropics customized for me for close to six months now and can confidently say that their nootropics have been a total game changer. My go-to formula is the Clarity Formula, I like to use that before cognitive work, and I use the Energy Formula before my workouts. To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit, go online to takethesis.com/huberman, take that three minute quiz and Thesis will send you four different formulas to try in your first month.

LMNT is an electrolyte drink that has all the things you need and none of what you don't. That means the electrolytes, salt, magnesium, and potassium are in there, but it does not have sugar. Electrolytes are key to cellular function, in particular neuronal or nerve cell function. In fact, for your nerve cells to be able to fire action potentials, those are the electrical signals that allow your brain and body to work and move and think, et cetera, you need sodium, a lot of people don't realize that. And while of course there are people out there that need to reduce their sodium intake, these would be people with pre-hypertension or hypertension, many people actually don't get enough sodium, especially people that are following low carbohydrate diets, drinking a lot of caffeine or eating extremely clean. Oftentimes, those people feel better when they increase their sodium intake and their health can actually improve when they increase their sodium intake. LMNT contains a science backed electrolyte ratio of one gram of sodium, 200 milligrams of potassium and 60 milligrams of magnesium. If you'd like to try LMNT, you can go to drinklmnt, that's l-m-n-t.com/huberman to claim a free element sample pack with any purchase. Again, that's drink LMNT, l-m-n-t.com/huberman. Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep. Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers with heating, cooling, and sleep tracking capacity. The reality is that sleep is the foundation of mental health, physical health, and performance. Now I've talked before in this podcast about the fact that there's a direct relationship between temperature and our ability to fall and stay asleep. In fact, our body temperature needs to drop by about one to three degrees in order to fall asleep and then there are further decreases in our body temperature that allow us to get into the deepest stages of sleep and the so-called rapid eye movement sleep, all the aspects of sleep that really restore our brain and body. And then waking up actually involves a heating up of core body temperature. By sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover, you're able to control the temperature of your sleeping environment precisely. I've been sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover for many months now and I can tell you it has completely changed my sleep. I thought I was sleeping pretty well before and now, frankly, I don't even want to travel because I don't want to be away from my Eight Sleep.

{"question": "What is the purpose of the Space-Time Bridging meditation practice, and how does it help individuals step through different time domains and improve their overall functioning in daily life?", "doc_id": "wTBSGgbIvsY_20", "video_id": "wTBSGgbIvsY", "video_title": "How Meditation Works & Science-Based Effective Meditations | Huberman Lab Podcast #96", "video_header": "Tool: Space-Time Bridging (STB)", "segment_idx": "20", "time_start": "2:14:54", "time_end": "2:24:59", "context": "I'm guessing some of you are probably wondering where to start or, if you're already an avid meditator, where to go with all this information. For that reason, I just wanted to offer you a particular form of meditation that incorporates all of the features that I've talked about up until now in a single meditation practice, and it's a meditation practice that, for lack of a better name, I called STB, or Space-Time Bridging. And the time component has to do with a very simple fact, which is when we focus our attention, visual attention or otherwise, on things close to or within our body, we tend to be fine slicing time. You could sort of think of your breath as more or less the second hands on your clock of existence, whereas when we tend to focus on things far away from us, we tend to parse or carve up time within bigger bins. If you've ever seen a airplane flying at a distance, it looks like it's moving very, very slowly. If you were right up next to that airplane, it's probably going 500 or 600 miles an hour, it would go by very quickly. This is not a coincidence. Believe it or not, how you slice the time domain of your life and your experience has everything to do with your vision, and the closer things are, the more finely you slice up time. The more closely your attention is placed on yourself, the more closely you slice up time. If you focus your visual attention very far or you think about the other side of the world, for instance, and you envision that, well, then you're actually slicing time more broadly. Hopefully that makes sense. Fine slicing would be like slow motion, higher frame rate. Looking in the distance, you're actually taking bigger time bins. So even though things look like they're moving more slowly, it's because your fidelity, your precision of measuring time is actually not as good. It's as if you only have the hours hand on the clock so it seems like it moves very slowly. Hopefully that makes sense to you. So there's a meditation practice that I call Space-Time Bridging that incorporates everything that I've talked about today. It balances interoception and exteroception, it balances interoception and dissociation, and it crosses the various time domains that the brain can encompass using vision. And it's a very simple meditation, it's one that I've been doing for years, and it's one that we're starting to do some research on, but I'm just going to share with you because I think it's actually quite fun and can be quite informative. In fact, people have told me that it can even lead to some interesting insights both during the meditation and outside the meditation. It's very simple, what you do, ideally you would do this outside or at a window, but what you do is you essentially close your eyes. I'm not going to do this now, I'm not going to close my eyes and do the meditation, but I'll describe it. You close your eyes and you focus your attention either on your third eye center or your breathing, and you try and put 100% of your perceptual awareness onto your breathing or your third eye center for the duration of three breaths, okay? So you're 100% or trying to be 100% in interoception. Then you open your eyes, you focus on the surface of your body someplace. I find that holding out my hand at sort of arm's distance and focusing on the palm of my hand and focusing there visually, so I'm splitting my attention now between my hand, and I'm also going to pay attention to my breath for the duration of three full inhales and exhales while also focusing on my hand, so you're splitting interoception and exteroception as best you can, about 50/50. Then you subsequently look at some location in your immediate environment, maybe 10, 15 feet away, and you focus your attention on that location while also splitting your attention so that you're still paying attention to your breathing, you do that for the duration of three breaths, but now you are in exteroception and interoception. Then you focus your attention at some distance further away, maybe the furthest distance you can see. Now, this is why it's useful to do out of a window or on a balcony or outdoors. You focus on the furthest point, maybe a horizon, some furthest point for the duration of three breaths while also paying attention to your breathing, and sort of imagine a bridge between the two if you find it to be challenging to focus on both. And then, and this is where it can be a little tricky, but then what you actually focus on is the fact, and this is not an imaginary thing, this is a fact that you are a tiny spec on this big ball that's floating out in space, right? The Earth that's floating out in space. And you try and focus on your three breaths while also acknowledging that you are a small body, literally, on this very seemingly large body, the Earth, but that's floating in a much larger, larger, expansive place, the universe, and you do that for three breaths. And then you close your eyes and you go right back into interoception, and you do that for three breaths. You focus on your interoception for three breaths. And you might want to march through these different locations a few times or back and forth if you like, but typically, I will just do it for one segment at pure interoception, palm of hand, some distance in front of me, horizon, whole globe, universe thing, back into body, et cetera. Why is this useful? Why would this be useful? Is it at all interesting, or is this just some crazy idea? Well, the reason it's useful, I believe, is that it has you deliberately step your awareness, your perception through every position along that interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum. Now, I did say to remain connected to, as they'll say in the yoga classes, aware of, I guess would be the more scientific way to state it, aware of one's breath, but if you wanted, you could actually try and put your awareness completely outside yourself, but most people will find that challenging to do if they're already paying attention to their breath. It's just hard to do, so I find it easier to just split my awareness from interoception to exteroception. But by stepping through these different locations and then deliberately placing your perception, your awareness back into pure interoception, what you do is you essentially are practicing or exercising this incredible ability that the human mind has to deliberately place your perception at specific locations along the interoceptive-exteroceptive continuum. And I think this is very useful because many of us, including myself, tend to get locked at one location along that continuum. For instance, if you're scrolling your phone for a long period of time, you may forget about your bodily sensations, but you generally forget about other things going on in the world. Or if you're very focused on things out in the world, you oftentimes can forget about your internal sensations and what's going on internally. And being functional in work, in life, in relationship, and in all aspects, including your ability to fall asleep, involves stepping yourself along these different locations, which, again, are not just physical locations of third eye center or your breathing or your hand or horizon. Those are just stations within space. But remember, each one of those, just by way of how your visual system and the time domain are interlocked with one another, sets your mind in a particular time domain. And so much of what involves being a functional human being involves dynamically adjusting our attention from what we are doing on our computer to a question somebody asks and then back again, or from text messaging to listening to a lecture or a podcast or from listening to a lecture or podcast and then going back into a mode of commuting, but making that commute either relaxing or maybe do work on your commute or connect with family or friends, et cetera. So much of the fatigue of life and the, I should say, the maladaptive behaviors and emotions that show up in life are really not about any set of behaviors or emotions being wrong or right, but rather inappropriately matched to the space-time domain that we're in, which, again, is just fancy nerd speak for saying being present and being mindful is a wonderful byproduct of a meditation practice, but it is but one of those stations along that space-time continuum. The key element here is to step yourself through a practice deliberately so that you are flexibly and dynamically able to engage in conversation, then disengage and focus, or focus and then disengage from the work you're focusing on and actually have a conversation or be in the world and move out of that interoceptive awareness to one in which you are dynamically engaged with the things around you. I realize this might sound a little bit vague. For that reason, I encourage you not to think about it too much, but rather to try the practice, see if it works for you. If it doesn't, that's fine. I think it is a good one for people that find that a third eye center or breathing-focused interoceptive meditation might be enjoyable to them or very beneficial to them, but they might want to try something new, and other people who might find that that tends to put them too much in their own head. I think it also ought to be very useful for people that tend to be overly exteroceptive, more on the dissociative end of the continuum, and need to bring in a bit more of interoceptive awareness, but either can't do that or are uncomfortable doing that because they're simply not interested in or comfortable with feeling so much of their internal state because that can either be overwhelming or that's just simply not the way they want to feel. Now, as we round up, I do want to acknowledge that there are an enormous number of rooms within the house, or rather, I should say, within the castle that is meditation, including, for instance, intention setting and mantras and an enormous number of different features of meditation practices that we simply did not have time to go into and/or for which the research on is not completely ironed out yet. And for that reason, in future episodes in not long from now, I'm going to be sitting down with experts in meditation that include neuroscientists and clinicians, but other experts in meditation that certainly are versed in those topics, and where they can't point to specific research studies can certainly point us toward the utility of things like mantras and intentions as they relate to getting the most out of a meditative practice, so I eagerly await those conversations, and I hope you will join me for those as well.

Estrogen", "segment_idx": "28", "time_start": "1:58:49", "time_end": "2:04:02", "context": "about UTIs I got a lot of questions about urinary tract infections let's make it related to both females and males because yes males get urinary tract infections females get them more females asked about urinary tract infections how common are they should they always be treated with antibiotics is cranberry really a good treatment if so why are there other things that are better is it relates to the acidity or alkalinity um how does one prevent getting UTIs can you get them from swimming should you urinate after sex tell us about UTIs and how not to get them and how to get rid of them happy to so UTIs are very common in women probably up to 50 of women get at least one UTI in their lifetime and up to a third of them get recurrent UTIs and what that means is they have two or more in six months or three or more in a year now this is common and so we'll see a lot of it and it's not as until you're having recurrent utsc you just have one a year or you have one every few years it's not a huge issue in men however UTIs are much less common and that's because the urethra is longer so there's less entry from the outside world into the bladder which causes infections and so um the when men go to UTI it's concerning like why is a man getting a UTI you know there's multiple reasons that it could happen but it should be investigated like so that you can make sure there's no anatomic abnormality or functional abnormality with a bladder that's causing the UTIs in terms of prevention there are kind of major things that are had in the guidelines that we all we all talk about so one is hydration so making sure you're drinking about two to three liters of fluid ideally water a day because dilution is the solution to the pollution right so drinking more fluids is going to get that bacteria and you're going to pee it out it's going to help keep not let it sit around in the bladder very often another thing in women who have Altered States of estrogen whether it's post-menopausal surgical menopause or maybe have a reduced estrogen for postpartum or other reasons but what about you in the second half of the menstrual cycle not necessarily for those specific people but for those specific times but because it's pretty short-lived I guess you could use it but um is vaginal estrogen so vaginal estrogen meaning estrogen that's applied in the vagina either through a cream a suppository or a ring is is highly effective in reducing the occurrence of recurrent UTIs and this is because when you have low estrogen the pH in the vagina goes up and the pH in the vagina goes up because there's less conversion of glycogen to lactobacilli and then those lactobacilla are preventative for UTIs so essentially you want to reduce the pH back to its normal acidic pH and vaginal estrogen is very effective at doing that fact in our clinics will actually check a vaginal pH you know to see if there is an indication that their pH is too high that maybe they do need vaginal estrogen particularly around like perimenopause because it's hard to tell just by looking if they are really um heading into a lower estrogen State sometimes and so that's very very effective and very very safe so when you look at estrogen you know the the Women's Health Initiative way back when sort of made a big stink about how estrogen is related to cancer however vaginal estrogen has never ever been a reported breast cancer uterine cancer or any other blood clot any other adverse event associated with vaginal estrogen you can get some breast tenderness some discharge those things can occur but the absorbed amount vaginally is so little that your estrogen level barely goes up it doesn't even reach pre-menopausal levels so it just goes up very slightly in the bloodstream not enough to create any sort of abnormality so a vaginal astronaut is extremely safe and it's pretty affordable you could actually use coupons if your insurance doesn't cover it through you know GoodRx or Mark Cuban's pharmacy and get it very very affordably and it's very effective it does take about three months to work so you know you have to be consistent you apply it about twice a week at night sometimes three times a week and it's very effective the ring you put in once and it lasts for three months but so generally speaking that's the most effective option for low estrogen States other kind of simple things are trying to make sure you're completely emptying your bladder so over a lifetime people can develop some mild pelvic floor dysfunction right not enough to create pain or discomfort but maybe they're not emptying completely right because maybe they used to hold their urine for long periods of time when they were a kid or maybe they're always hovering over the toilet because they don't want to sit on it at work and over time that can create a little bit of mild dysfunction which can make it more difficult to completely empty the bladder and when urine is sitting in the bladder for long periods of time it's basically food for bacteria to grow and so bacteria grows and then you get recurrent UTI so making sure you're completely empty by sitting relaxing on the toilet sometimes leaning forward and then maybe going a second time so standing up sitting back down going again and even for men sometimes trying to sit and see if you completely empty because sometimes standing you're not able to empty completely whoa a lot of men are gonna because they're these you know it was fun to research for this"}
{"question": "Is it true that a person's likelihood of developing male pattern baldness is largely determined by the number and sensitivity of their androgen receptors, which are inherited from their mother?", "doc_id": "ncSoor2Iw8k_11", "video_id": "ncSoor2Iw8k", "video_title": "Dr. Kyle Gillett: How to Optimize Your Hormones for Health & Vitality", "video_header": "Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), Hair Loss", "segment_idx": "11", "time_start": "38:55", "time_end": "43:40", "context": "So men and women both make DHT. I'd like to ask about DHT in men. So often we hear about testosterone in men and free testosterone being the unbound form of course. But dihydrotestosterone, where does it come from in men? What is the cascade of events that takes testosterone to dihydrotestosterone and what are some of the quote/unquote positive and negative effects of, here I'm only referring to endogenous dihydrotestosterone. And in fact, I'll make it very clear whether or not I'm talking about taking something or one's own natural production. Here we're just, I think up until now we've just been talking about natural production. So tell us about DHT in men, such a powerful hormone during development obviously. But what is it doing? - DHT is a very androgenic hormone. So whether you're talking about DHEA, which is a weak androgen, or testosterone, which is a relatively strong androgen, or DHT, which is a very strong androgen, they bind to the androgen receptor in both men and in women. So the effect of all three of those is mediated by the androgen receptor. There's a couple different beta-estradiol receptors and alpha-estradiol receptors, but there's only one androgen receptor. Intriguingly, it is on the X chromosome, so men get their androgen receptor gene from their mother. Women get one androgen receptor gene from their father, one from their mother. Often the one that is more sensitive to androgens and people with PCOS, that's the one that's active. The other one is methylated and inactive. - Can I just pause you one second? Sorry to interrupt, but I have to ask this question before I forget. And I know a number of people are probably wondering, I've heard that whether or not one develops male pattern baldness, whether or not a male develops male pattern baldness, just to be very precise, you could get some information about that by looking at your mother's father, and that would, in keeping with what you just described, that the X chromosome, which of course is handed off through the mother, is carrying the genes that encode for the number and distribution of these androgen receptors that DHT will bind to, 'cause of course, I think as you'll probably tell us, that DHD is a responsible for male pattern bald and beard growth, is that right? Should I look at my grandfather on my mother's side to determine what I'm likely to look like in terms of my DHT-ness, is that a word? - Yeah, it's the best guess that you could make purely from phenotypes. Now you can measure your genotype and get a better idea of that. Assuming that it's true male pattern baldness, it's related to the gene transcription of the androgen receptor. So I like to think of it as how much of this androgen receptor gene is activated by any androgen? So if you have an extremely sensitive gene, which usually means you have very few CAG repeats, which is basically just a certain, CAG encodes for a certain amino acid, and if you have very few of the repeats, then your androgen receptor gene works better. Think of it as a corollary to Huntington's disease where if you have very few of, called trinucleotide repeats, then it's not as severe as a disease, but after you get more and more CAG repeats, which by the way are, in the population you're getting more and more CAG repeats, so it's a natural selection of process that has been ongoing for a variety of number of reasons. But anyway if you have more repeats, then that gene activates in the cytoplasm and moves to the nucleus and causes gene transcription more often and hair loss more often. - So does that mean that we're seeing more hair loss now due to elevated levels of DHT than we were 50 years ago? - Probably not. The hair loss 50 years ago, well, not 50 years ago, but 500 years ago, was probably more significant, because on average, 500 years ago, people were more sensitive to androgens. So there's a syndrome called androgen insensitivity syndrome, AIS and that syndrome was related to when men, who have the copy from their mother who is a carrier, their AR gene, or androgen receptor gene, is completely insensitive. So think of it, it's not related to the CAG repeats, but think of that receptor as just not working at all.

Going back to that, my understanding is that taking hCG several times per week can help maintain spermatogenesis and fertility even while people are on testosterone. But-- and you and I were talking about this earlier-- that there's tremendous variation. Some people will take a small amount testosterone and just crush their sperm count. They just won't make any viable sperm. Other people can maintain viable sperm production while on testosterone, especially if they're taking hCG. Is that right? KYLE GILLETT: Correct. And there's many reasons for this. Some of this has to do with heat damage to the testes, so potentially cold therapy could be helpful for that. And-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ice baths, cold showers? KYLE GILLETT: Mhm. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, or just avoid-- and certainly avoiding-- KYLE GILLETT: Mostly avoiding heat. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --sauna and hot tub. Yeah. KYLE GILLETT: Stopping the daily hot tub can restore fertility in many people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I know a number of people that are trying to conceive children that go into the sauna, and they'll just put a cold pack in their shorts or between their legs depending on whether or not they're wearing shorts or not when they go in. Or they'll alternate ice and heat in a way that maintains coolness of the milieu in which the sperm live. In other words, they're cooling their scrotum deliberately in order to avoid killing the sperm. Actually, I saw an interesting paper that said that for every two degree increase in temperature of the scrotum, there's a 20% decrease in spermatogenesis and viability of sperm. And that actually, if you look at the difference between people who stand a lot, sit a lot, and drive a lot, what you see is a progressive decrease in sperm count because when people are sitting, there's an increase in temperature, and then when they're sitting on the hot seat of the car, there's an-- or using the heated seats, actually, it kills sperm. I think there are good data on that. KYLE GILLETT: Yeah, excellent data, and anecdotally, you see it as well. I've had several patients come in for fertility consultations. And all we do is like, no medications, no supplements. We change their-- several lifestyle things. Very tight fitting clothing is another one. And soon, they have fertility again and they're no longer-- they have sperm whereas before, they did not. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting."}

Most people don't know this, but there's a brain structure called the anterior mid-cingulate cortex. As we pointed out before, that's a noun. It's a name. It doesn't mean anything. We could call it the Cookie Monster. But what's interesting about this brain area is there are now a lot of data in humans, not some mouse study, showing that when people do something they don't want to do like add three hours of exercise per day or per week or when people who are trying to diet and lose weight resist eating something, when people do anything that they, and this is the important part, that they don't want to do, it's not about adding more work. It's about adding more work that you don't want to do. This brain area gets bigger. Now here's what's especially interesting about this brain area to me. And by the way, I'm only learning this recently because it's new data. But there's a lot of it. The anterior mid-cingulate cortex is smaller in obese people. It gets bigger when they diet. It's larger in athletes. It's especially large or grows larger in people that see themselves as challenged and overcome some challenge. And in people that live a very long time, this area keeps its size. In many ways, scientists are starting to think of the anterior mid-cingulate cortex not just as one of the seats of willpower but perhaps actually the seat of the will to live. DAVID GOGGINS: See, now we're talking. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And when I learned about the anterior mid-cingulate cortex, I was like almost out of my seat. And I've been in the neuroscience game since I was 20. DAVID GOGGINS: Now we're talking. ANDREW HUBERMAN: We're the same age. And I was so pumped because I've heard of the amygdala, fear, prefrontal cortex. It's planning an action. I could tell you every brain area and every-- I teach neuroanatomy to medical students. But when I started seeing the data on the anterior mid-cingulate cortex, I was like, whoa, this is interesting. And all the data point to the fact that we can build this area up. But that as quickly as we build it up, if we don't continue to invest in things that are hard for us, that we don't want to do-- that's the part that feels so Goggin-esque to me, that we don't want to do. Like if you love the ice bath-- yeah, I love the ice bath-- and you go from 1 minute to 10 minutes, guess what, your anterior mid-cingulate cortex did not grow. DAVID GOGGINS: None. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But if you hate the cold water, if you're afraid of drowning and you get into water and put your head under and survive, then the anterior mid-cingulate cortex gets bigger. But if you don't do it the next day or if you do it the next day and you enjoy it because, hey, hey, I did it yesterday, woo-hoo, happy me, Merry Christmas as you would say-- DAVID GOGGINS: Right. Merry Christmas. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --guess what, the anterior mid-cingulate cortex shrinks again. To me, this is one of the most important discoveries that neuroscience has ever made because it's that I don't want to do something but do it anyway that grows this area. And it's almost like-- I have a friend. He's been sober 30 years from alcohol. And he always says, the amazing thing about addiction is there's a cure. The problem is it only works one day at a time. And so you have to renew it every day. DAVID GOGGINS: That's right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So the anterior mid-cingulate cortex to me-- when I learned about it, two things went off in my head. Whoa, this is super interesting. And, two, I got to tell David Goggins about this. And I waited until now-- DAVID GOGGINS: I'm glad. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --to tell you because I felt like, well, for obvious reasons I wanted to tell you and I wanted to tell you here. DAVID GOGGINS: Well, I love that because that's how I've lived my entire life. I don't know anything about that. But people go, man, you have such a strong will. It's something that you build. Like I never forget I was on a podcast one time. And this dude goes you were blessed with a strong mind. Like the hell are you talking about I was blessed with a strong mind? That's something that you have to develop. You develop that over years, decades of suffering and going back into the suffer. That's why a lot of people who graduate Navy SEAL training, they want to know-- I talk about it very openly all the time. A lot of guys don't want to go back into that water, don't want to go back into the hard stuff. And maybe not-- anything hard, anything hard in life, once you get through it, it's like you become a POW. Like how many POWs you know want to go back to POW camp? None. When something sucks so bad in life-- this is on this that we're talking about now-- very few people want to go back. They're happy they graduated. I realized I'm the same way. I don't want to go back. I have to go back. I must go back because that is exactly where all the knowledge of my life exists was back there in what you're exactly what you're talking about. Well, I didn't know anything about this. But how I grew a will was constantly doing these things to now it's just life. I wake up. While it still sucks, it's just life. You don't sit back and like, oh my god. Like I have days I don't want to do. But I know I'm going to do it. I know from years of just doing it. So that's beautiful. And this is why I came on here with you today. And I'm glad that you're talking about this because human beings need to hear this. They need to stop hearing these hacks on this and that. There's no fucking hack, bro. There's no fucking hack. Yeah, you may this and that and saunas and all this shit that they-- yeah, it's great. There is no fucking life hack. To grow that thing-- how do you grow it? Do it, and do it, and do it, and do it. That's the hack. The hack is going to fucking suck. And that's what I realized. That's what I realized. That's why I wanted to come on here today. I didn't want to come on here and talk about no fucking passion and purpose and how to get the fuck out of bed and how to hit a fucking alarm clock, all this catchphrase bullshit because that wasn't how I lived, wasn't how I lived. I lived, I woke up like every human being does and goes fuck, man. I'm a fucking piece of shit today. How the hell is this going to work out for me? And you fight that. And you fight that. You don't override it. There's no override button. It's the conversation in your head. So how do you do that?

{"question": "How can I cultivate a sense of empowerment and humility, and then express them as verbs of agency and gratitude to improve my life and relationships?", "doc_id": "yOJvm_ri_hk_21", "video_id": "yOJvm_ri_hk", "video_title": "Dr. Paul Conti: Tools and Protocols for Mental Health | Huberman Lab Guest Series", "video_header": "Self & Strivings; Empowerment & Humility", "segment_idx": "21", "time_start": "2:00:17", "time_end": "2:09:02", "context": "is that no matter how well or how poorly any of our lives happen to be going, that by looking in these cupboards under structure of self and function of self, we can have so much more positive control. Paul Conti: Yes. That's why ultimately, what we're talking about is optimistic. We can't help ourselves if we don't honor truth. And the truth is that there are complex aspects of this. So, okay, we want to go look at that, and we want to look at how things can go wrong, and that's all very, very important. But that's all wrapped in the best truth, which is that we can change it. We can make it better. That's why the self, the garden of self, is on top of the structure of self. And the top of the function of self are our strivings. That's what comes next after behaviors. It's like, what are my behaviors doing? What am I doing? What am I striving towards? What am I doing, literally? Am I going to a job I hate? Am I doing things I don't want to do? Am I accepting treatment that I don't want to accept? Am I treating people in ways I don't want to accept? How can I strive for better? And striving and hopefulness are so intertwined. So the pinnacle of the function pillar is striving. The pinnacle of the structure pillar is self. And we can see how the self, the strivings. What we're doing now is combining the pillars. It's where it comes together. And your imagery of... That's where the geyser comes from. And we want that geyser to be healthy. It's a stream of clear, clean water that's coming out of it. That's where our empowerment is. But empowerment is a condition of being. I am empowered. Empowerment rests within me. That's where humility comes into the picture. Humility also something within me. I have humility. They're not verbs, but empowerment and humility then gain their expression at the top of that geyser. When agency and gratitude, those verbs, arise from empowerment and humility. Andrew Huberman: What you've drawn for us is an incredibly compelling picture, because the picture or the map is really a roadmap. It's a path to ideals. And you've been talking about these ideals of agency and gratitude across this series, and they just encompass so much. And as you mentioned before, they are interconnected and they are verb states. And a critical component of the geysering up from the pillars toward agency and gratitude are these two components of empowerment and humility. Tell us a little bit more about empowerment and humility and how we should view empowerment and humility in the context of self-care. Paul Conti: Well, empowerment is a state that we can create for ourselves if we're taking care of the pillars, right? So we're looking in the cupboards. We're doing the things that make our map clearer and clearer. This idea that, oh, that seemed like a good path, but it gets clearer, and there's a swamp there, right? Or that didn't seem like a good path because it's circuitous. Oh, no. But there are good things along that path. So the map gets clearer as we tend to the cupboards in the pillars, and that empowers us. We're in a state. There's a state inside of us that is a state of potentials that are now skewed in a good way. That's what empowerment is. It's not something that happens. It's a state that we then bring to bear on what happens. The same is true of humility. Humility does not mean not acknowledging things that are good about you. And we often can very much mischaracterize humility. Like, is that person being weak? Is it false humility? Or people often who are conscientious don't want to acknowledge good things about them? Oh, no, I'm not that smart. That's not humility. Humility is consistent with truth. So if you keep saying you're not that smart, but the world around you tells you that you're that smart. Then acknowledge that you're that smart. That's coming through the lens of truth. And we can go down to the pillars and the cupboards and say, okay, how does a person get to acknowledging that truth? So it's only by squaring away the things that humility isn't. It is not denigrating ourselves. And we see that in a lot of people. I'm humble. And then that person often tells you why they're accepting something that's not good to accept. So humility is about acknowledging truthfully the characteristics that you have within yourself, good and bad. And here is where we can identify things that we're not so happy with. We have to have humility within us in order to make ourselves better. Just like I have to say, look, I'd like to be more fit if I'm going to then get myself in a more fit state. So saying, look, I can be a little bit snippy with people if I'm irritated, or I can be a little bit condescending, or I can be a little selfish at times, it's hard to admit these things to ourselves. But if we have the humility to acknowledge those things, then we also get to have that broader humility about just being a person. Like, wow, look how complicated this is to navigate life. I mean, these pillars are not simple. And when we go down to the real base elements of them, it can get very complicated. So then we have a compassion for self and for others. Sometimes I'll say to a person, I should be doing this, I should be doing that. They think they should be doing something perfectly. And I will say to them, it's amazing that we're moving forward, right? I mean, let's start with, wow, it's not easy to be human. It's not easy to navigate this world. And that kind of humility can then allow us to feel good about what we build on top of it. It's not easy to navigate this world. And humans are pretty vulnerable, by and large. But I'm applying myself. And I'm proud that I'm applying myself or that I'm perseverant, but also I'd like to be a little more compassionate. It's that sort of thing that combines with empowerment. So empowerment and humility are these potential states that then express themselves or become enacted, however we wish to put that. But they change into the active verbs of agency and gratitude. And agency and gratitude are ways of being. They're verbs. They're active. So that's the point of it. From the sense of how we are living. How we are being. That's why agency and gratitude is in some sense its own endpoint. But because there's a circular aspect of this, our active being is not the endpoint. If we're being in a healthy way, then we get to experience things. Peace, contentment, delight. We experience them because we are healthy. So we get to be through the lens of agency and gratitude. We get to experience peace, contentment and delight. And that makes a healthier us. The drives and their expression are in better balance. The generative drive is fostered and strengthened. And the drives underneath of it, the aggression, assertion, proactive. We're really using that in a good way. And we're mining all of it within us. Like, I want to bring that to bear, and I can bring more of it to bear. That's very, very good. And the pleasure drive is active in us. I'm enjoying the things I do. I feel good about the things I do. I'm making good choices. And that state of health, what it promotes, the pillars, the cupboards, to stay clean and clear and healthy, right? But life is life. And the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, the slings and arrows of life will continue to come at us and cause us to go back and look at the pillars and the cupboards. And even if they don't come at us, those things are never perfect, right? But that's not bad, because by tending to them, where do we bring ourselves? We bring ourselves back to the active verbs of agency and gratitude, the active verbs of living. And here we are. In this cycle that if we pay attention to it, we use it to understand ourselves, we use it to improve ourselves, can bring us to better lives."}

{"question": "What are some effective ways that Meta can promote its numerous safety tools and features to users, especially teenagers, to help them customize their social media experience and protect their mental health?", "doc_id": "1Wo6SqLNmLk_16", "video_id": "1Wo6SqLNmLk", "video_title": "Mark Zuckerberg & Dr. Priscilla Chan: Curing All Human Diseases & the Future of Health & Technology", "video_header": "Parental Controls, Meta Social Media Tools & Tailoring Experience", "segment_idx": "16", "time_start": "1:19:17", "time_end": "1:24:49", "context": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yesterday, I had the very good experience of learning from the Meta team about safety protections that are in place for kids who are using Meta Platforms. And frankly, I was really positively surprised at the huge number of filter-based tools and just ability to customize the experience so that it can stand the best chance of enriching-- not just remaining neutral, but enriching their mental health status. One thing that came about in that conversation, however, was I realized there are all these tools. But do people really know that these tools exist? And I think about my own experience with Instagram. I love watching Adam Mosseri's Friday Q&As because he explains a lot of the tools that I didn't know existed. And if people haven't seen that, I highly recommend they watch that. I think he takes questions on Thursdays and answers them most every Fridays. So if I'm not aware of the tools without watching that, that exists for adults, how does Meta look at the challenge of making sure that people know that there are all these tools-- I mean, dozens and dozens of very useful tools? But I think most of us just know the hashtag, the tag, the click, stories versus feed. We now know that-- I also post to Threads. I mean, so we know the major channels and tools. But this is like owning a vehicle that has incredible features that one doesn't realize can take you off road, can allow your vehicle to fly. I mean, there's a lot there. So what do you think could be done to get that information out? Maybe this conversation could cue people to [INAUDIBLE].. MARK ZUCKERBERG: I mean, that's part of the reason why I wanted to talk to you about this. I mean, I think most of the narrative around social media is not, OK, all of the different tools that people have to control their experience. It's the narrative of is this just negative for teens or something. And I think, again, a lot of this comes down to how is the experience being tuned. Are people using it to connect in positive ways? And if so, I think it's really positive. So yeah, I mean, I think part of this is we probably just need to get out and talk to people more about it. And then there's an in-product aspect, which is if you're a teen and you sign up, we take you through a pretty extensive experience that tries to outline some of this. But that has limits, too, because when you sign up for a new thing, if you're bombarded with here's a list of features, you're like, OK, I just signed up for this. I don't really understand much about what the service is. Let me go find some people to follow who are my friends on here before I learn about controls to prevent people from harassing me or something. That's why I think it's really important to also show a bunch of these tools in context. So if you're looking at comments, and if you go to delete a comment, or you go to edit something, try to give people prompts in line. It's like, hey, did that you can manage things in these ways around that? Or when you're in the inbox and you're filtering something, remind people in line. So just because of the number of people who use the products and the level of nuance around each of the controls, I think the vast majority of that education, I think, needs to happen in the product. But I do think that through conversations like this and others that we need to be doing, I think we can create a broader awareness that those things exist so that way at least people are primed so that way when those things pop up in the product people, they're like, oh yeah, I knew that there was this control. And here's how I would use that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I find the restrict function to be very useful, more than the block function in most cases. I do sometimes have to block people. But the restrict function is really useful that you could filter specific comments. You might recognize that someone has a tendency to be a little aggressive. And I should point out that I actually don't really mind what people say to me. But I try and maintain what I call classroom rules in my comment section, where I don't like people attacking other people because I would never tolerate that in the university classroom. I'm not going to tolerate that in the comments section, for instance. MARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah. And I think that the example that you just used about restrict versus block gets to something about product design that's important, too, which is that block is this very powerful tool that if someone is giving you a hard time and you just want them to disappear from the experience, you can do it. But the design trade-off with that is that in order to make it so that the person is just gone from the experience and that you don't show up to them, they don't show up to you-- inherent to that is that they will have a sense that you blocked them. And that's why I think some stuff like restrict or just filtering, like I just don't want to see as much stuff about this topic-- people like using different tools for very subtle reasons. I mean, maybe you want the content to not show up, but you don't want the person who's posting the content to know that you don't want it to show up. Maybe you don't want to get the messages in your main inbox, but you don't want to tell the person actually that you're not friends or something like that. You actually need to give people different tools that have different levels of power and nuance around how the social dynamics around using them play out in order to really allow people to tailor the experience in the ways that they want.

Earlier, I mentioned that salt and your hunger and thirst for salt is homeostatically regulated, and indeed, that's the case, much like temperature is homeostatically regulated. What that means is, if you pay attention to it, if your salt levels are low, you will tend to crave salt and salty beverages and salty foods, and in most cases, you should probably follow that craving provided those salty beverages and salty foods are not bringing in a lot of other things or anything, ideally, that's bad for you, so I think it's fair to say that whether or not you're vegan, vegetarian, carnivore, omnivore, that we should all try to limit our ingestion of processed foods, a'ight? My read of the literature is that, sure, some processed foods are acceptable for us and aren't going to kill us outright, but that for most people in the world, eating fewer processed foods is just going to be a good thing to do, so following your salt hunger and thirst, in most cases, is going to be beneficial provided that it's in the context of eating healthy, nonprocessed foods on whatever backdrop of nutritional and dietary recommendations is right for you. I simply can't tell you what to eat and what not to eat because I acknowledge the fact that some people are vegans because of ethical reasons related to animals, or some people are vegans because of reasons related to the climate and the environment. Other people do it for specific health reasons. Likewise, I know plenty of people that eat meat and avoid vegetables, believe it or not, and I know people that eat both, and they do this, often, each, I should say, all, citing literature that supports their particular camp and their particular view. It's not a territory I want to get into, but with respect to salt intake and the fact that salt intake is homeostatically regulated, it is the case that if you're craving salt, you probably need it, so for those of you that are sweating excessively, or even if you're in a very hot environment, and you're not exercising, and you're just losing, you're losing water and salt from your system, remember, also, that you can be in a very cold environment, very cold, dry environments often go together, and you can be losing a lot of fluids from your body, and you will crave fluids and salt even though it's cold and you're not actually noticeably perspiring, so if you're exercising a lot, if you're in a particular cold, dry environment or a particular hot environment, you ought to be ingesting sufficient amounts of salt and fluid. A rule of thumb for exercise-based replenishment of fluid comes from what I, some episodes back, referred to as the Galpin equation. The Galpin equation, I named it after Andy Galpin, and I think that is the appropriate attribution there. Andy Galpin is an exercise physiologist at Cal State, Fullerton, I believe, and he's going to be a podcast guest here on the Huberman Lab Podcast. He's an exceptional muscle physiologist. He also lives in the practical realm where he gives recommendations about exercise to expert athletes as well as the everyday person, so the Galpin equation is based on the fact that we lose about one to five pounds of water per hour, which can definitely impact our mental capacity and our physical performance, and the reason that loss of water from our system impacts mental capacity and physical performance has a lot to do with, literally, the changes in the volume of those cells, the size of those cells, based on how much sodium is contained in or outside those cells, and something that I've alluded to before on the podcast, and I'll talk about more in a moment, which is that neurons signal to one another by way of electricity through something called the action potential, and that actually requires sodium and potassium and magnesium, so the Galpin equation suggests that we start exercise hydrated with electrolytes, not just with water, so that means water that has some sodium, potassium, and magnesium. There are simple, low-cost ways to do that we'll talk about, and the formula for hydration, the so-called Galpin equation, is your body weight in pounds divided by 30 equals the ounces of fluid you should drink every 15 minutes. That may turn out to be more fluid than you can comfortably consume during the activity that you're performing. Now, the Galpin equation is mainly designed for exercise, but I think is actually a very good rule of thumb for any time that you need to engage mental capacity, not just physical performance. Your body weight in pounds divided by 30 equals the ounces of fluid you should drink every 15 minutes does not necessarily mean you have to ingest it every 15 minutes on the dot, and I think many activities, physical activities, but also cognitive activities like Zoom meetings or in-person meetings or lecturing or running or cycling are going to make it complicated to ingest the appropriate amount of fluid every 15 minutes on the dot. I'm not going to speak for Andy, for Dr. Galpin, but I think he would probably agree that these are averages to shoot for, and that unless you're hyperneurotic, the idea is to make sure that you're entering the activity, cognitive or physical, sufficiently hydrated, and that throughout that activity, you're hydrating regularly, and it points to the fact that most people are probably underhydrating, but not just underhydrating from the perspective of not ingesting enough water, that they're probably not getting enough electrolytes as well: sodium, potassium, and magnesium, so I've said two somewhat contradictory things. On the one hand, I've said, \"Follow your salt appetite. \"Follow your salt thirst. \"If you're craving salt, \"ingest some salt until you stop craving the salt.\" On the other hand, I've given you this fairly specific recommendation based on the Galpin equation that you should ingest your body weight in pounds divided by 30. That's how many ounces of fluid you should drink every 15 minutes, which I'm guessing, for most people, is going to be more fluid than they're currently drinking, on average, and so how could it be that you can have a recommendation for what's optimal that's different than the amount that you would reflexively drink? And it has to do with the fact that a lot of the hormone systems like vasopressin antidiuretic hormone, other hormones like aldosterone, and a lot of the neural and hormonal signals that govern salt and water balance are fairly slow to kick in, so, for instance, if you eat a fairly salty meal, and you sense that salt, you'll probably, meaning you detect it and perceive it because the food tastes salty, you'll probably want to drink a fair amount of fluid with it, whereas if some of the salt is disguised by other flavors, something that we'll talk about in a few minutes when we talk about the neural representation of things like salty and sweet, well, then, you might not notice that something's salty, and then, a few minutes or hours after ingesting that meal, you might feel very, very tired. You might even wonder whether or not it's because of some blood sugar effect. Maybe it's a crash in blood sugar, you might think, or something else related to that meal, or maybe you think it's because of some other event in your life, but actually, what has happened is you're dehydrated because you didn't recognize that you needed to drink more fluids, so I want to acknowledge the contradiction in the idea that everything is homeostatically regulated, and therefore you are aware of what you need, and the counterargument that, ah, you need to follow these strict recommendations is actually going to be somewhere in between, and, of course, your body and brain can start to adapt to certain levels of salt intake. There's now a fairly famous study that was done in Germany which looked at different phases of salt intake, meaning they had subjects ingest either 12 grams of salt per day or 9 grams per day or 6 grams per day for fairly long periods of time, and they collected urine for testing. This was actually a very controlled study. I'm just going to paraphrase from the National Institutes of Health report on this study because they did a very nice write-up of it, and they say that a big surprise of these results is that whatever the level of salt that was consumed, sodium was stored and released from the subjects' bodies in fairly regular weekly and monthly patterns, meaning people tended to adapt to a certain level of salt intake, and then it led to a fairly constant amount of salt retention and urine fluid excretion, and that's because of the various hormones, like aldosterone, which regulates sodium excretion from the kidney, and glucocorticoids, which we'll talk about more in a moment, which help regulate metabolism. Glucocorticoids are released from the adrenal glands, which ride atop the kidneys, and there's a very close relationship between the stress system glucocorticoids and the salt system, so the reason why your salt appetite isn't a perfect readout of how much salt you should ingest and why it might be helpful to follow some of these formulas like the Galpin equation, especially if you're engaging in exercise where you're going to be perspiring, of course, is that your body will tend to adapt to a certain amount of salt intake over time, and then, your appetite for salt won't necessarily be the best indication of how much salt you should ingest or avoid. Before I move on, I want to really reemphasize the fact that inside of the Galpin equation there is that mention of every 15 minutes, and people have come back to me again and again about this saying, \"I can't drink that much water every 15 minutes. \"It's too much volume of fluid in my stomach. \"I can't run with that,\" et cetera. Remember, these are averages, so that's what you want to average around a particular activity. These not strict recommendations where a buzzer goes off and every 15 minutes you have to chug that exact amount of electrolyte-containing solution. Another key feature of the study that I was referring to before, which, incidentally, was published in the \"Journal of Clinical Investigation,\" is that the body regulates its salt and water balance, not just by excreting sodium, right? But by retaining or releasing water, and this is because of the relationship between sodium and water that we were talking about before, and the advantage of this mechanism, they state, here I'm paraphrasing, is that the long-term maintenance of body fluids is dependent, is not as dependent on external water as once believed, right? What this system probably evolved to do was to adjust to different levels of sodium availability in the environment, and that raises a really key element"}

But, basically, the cochlea send information to what's called the spiral ganglion. A ganglion, by the way, if you're going to learn any neuroscience, just know that anytime you hear ganglion, a ganglion is just a clump, so it means a bunch of neurons. So a clump of cells. So the spiral ganglion is a bunch of neurons that the information then goes off to what are called the cochlear nuclei in the brainstem. Brainstem is down near your neck, then up to a structure that has a really cool name called the superior olive, because you have one on each side of your brain. And if I were to bring you to my lab and show you the superior olives in your brain or anyone else's brain, they look like little olives, even that little divot in them that to me, it looks like a pimiento, but they just call them the superior olive. And then the neurons in the superior olive, then they send information up to what's called the inferior colliculus, only called inferior because it sits below a structure called the superior colliculus. And then the information goes up to what's called the medial geniculate nucleus. And then up to your neocortex where you make sense of it all.

uh camera right um so what did you observe in terms of changes in brown fat how quickly did that occur and um and then I'd like to ask also about sauna a bit more um because earlier you mentioned that you can activate Brown fat with sauna as well with heat on the surface surface of the skin um how long did it take before you observe significant increases in brown fat um and was it increased density of my brown fat or distribution was it you know showing expansion to different regions throughout the body and um maybe you could also touch on some of the changes in in insulin sensitivity and metabolism yeah a very good good question and and I didn't mention this before but besides measuring um temperature as an outcome for brown fat activity we also uh did pet MRI scanning of the brown fat so this is like the the golden standard uh for measuring Brown fat and it's not very feasible for normal people to get an an a PET CT or pit MRI scanning of the brown fat is super expensive um so we had both uh to see if we could have like a continuous measure of brown fat in humans because that was already not not out there so I wanted to see during both the experimental days but also during day and night what kind of like sadian uh Rhythm do we have in our Brown fat activity so that's why I wanted to have that as well so the PET CT scanning or the pet MRI scanning was to see upon code activation um stimulation for some hours do we have activation can we see the brown fat in this subject and also during thermoneutrality or thermal comfortable State uh how is that activated in each of the group of course ah so you want to see how comfortable people were away from the cold water and sauna just at different um temperatured environments is that right yes I also mened that how comfortable are you I I made this scale like visual analog scale and asked them how comfortable do you feel with this temperature um and throughout the study days during Cod exposure and thermal comfortable day that had a whole day where I just kept them therm comfortable to see do they activate the brown fat if they're just completely therm comfortable as good as we could get with that because we were asking people um on a scale from one one to 10 and five being theroc comfortable where are you on this scale so one would be very cold and 10 would be super burning hot um yeah and so that was a way to like try to figure out how do they actually feel also during the studies I also measured um Electro myography so of of muscles to see do they shiver during the cooling day uh sometimes people shiver before they know they're really shivering so I had interesting yeah so so our conscious perception of shivering might not be the best readout of shiver yeah well if you also get adapted to the cold water you will have less shivering they would be less vigorous they will be very small so you wouldn't probably know that you shivering because it's the Shivering is so small and the mitochondria in the muscle cells will be so densed that it doesn't need to shiver maybe that much to get that thermogenesis going um compared to when you're completely new uh to co water exposure you're not adapted then the body needs to create this mitochondria this energy fabric to keep you you warm and that's also what the exercise is in the beginning but um when we measured this we we did see that the winter swimmers were shivering less H or uh having less uh vigorous shivering when they said I'm cold so even though they they perception their perception of the cold was pretty similar in in the in the groups um we could see that the the activation of the the muscles that measured on um were different and more vigorous in the control group were the subjects incentivized to be in the study were they paid or anything of that sort they just happen to like doing uh cold and sauna and so that's why they did the study um well they got paid a little bit for it but not much and um that's how we do this St sure I was just curious yeah I was just curious there might be some folks that Wonder so so what did you discover in terms of changes in brown fat insulin resistance or insulin sensitivity rather and um metabolism so what we we saw was we had this kind of different measures uh to see what's to try and unre what what's actually going on when they are already adapted to the cold water compared to a control group who was matched on on various parameters we we did see that the winter swimmers had an increased insulin sensitivity they produced less insulin uh on all the experimental days so besides from just cooling them and measuring the brown fat on each of these cooling days there were two cooling days and one theroc comfortable day right so I wanted to measure insulin when they just they were fasting meaning that they hadn't eaten in uh eight hours before the study day um and they were completely laying still not moving just in a bed um and we measured insulin uh during the experimental day just to see how what level are they on and we could see that the the the winter swim it had lower production of insulin and they also when they had an glucose drink so we give them that to see if they to test before we enroll them in studies to see if they have diabetes for example and not knowing for example that that wouldn't that would like ruin maybe the studies so we test for that and see if they have like a normal curve so what we did see in that was that the winter swimmers had a faster glucose clearance in the bloodstream so after 2 hours uh we could see that they had a lower level and it went the curve went down faster than in the control group so despite having lower insulin release they have better blood glucose clearance which is really what you want what we all seek right you don't excessive insulin is bad insulin being a um more or less a chaperone for blood glucose um um can do all sorts of other things as well of course but um and having high blood glucose obviously terrible yeah for cells especially brain cells I don't think people realize how toxic high blood glucose is having high glucose is if you want to kill neurons you make you make their uh put them in an environment where there's too much sugar ah um oh yeah very yeah very neurotoxic I mean that's and there are mechanisms like insulin that buffer that keep you know keeping blood glucose in a reasonable range so that um it doesn't happen I mean I think that's why people will go into insulinemic shock hypoglycemic shock is also possible so that range in which neurons are happy is not AIT is not a tremendously large range incidentally the range in which neurons are are um happy and surviving uh is much greater as one gets colder than when you heat up I mean you you can basically destroy brain cells by getting too hot for too long oh yeah yeah you can definitely destroy brain cells permanently by getting too cold for too long but you have to get really really cold for a really long time yeah yeah um very interesting yeah we we're thinking about doing an episode on um uh sort of survival of the brain after death kind of things which actually happens you know you hear about these people who are declared dead and then come back and there is actually now a lot of cryopreservation type approaches for that this is uh anyway we risk

{"question": "Does exposure to cold or heat in the evening affect my ability to fall asleep, and if so, how can I optimize my sleep by timing my cold or heat exposure?", "doc_id": "EQ3GjpGq5Y8_15", "video_id": "EQ3GjpGq5Y8", "video_title": "The Science & Health Benefits of Deliberate Heat Exposure | Huberman Lab Podcast #69", "video_header": "Circadian Rhythm & Body Temperature, Cold & Heat Exposure", "segment_idx": "15", "time_start": "1:08:29", "time_end": "1:11:58", "context": "Well, it has to do with the circadian shifts in temperature that we all experience. Talked a lot about this in the circadian episodes and the episodes related to sleep. But in a nutshell, here's how it works. Every early morning, about two hours before your typical wake up time, your body temperature is at its all-time lowest. We call that your temperature minimum. Right about waking your body temperature increases. In fact, an increase in body temperature is part of the reason you wake up at all, unless, of course, you're setting an alarm. Increases in body temperature are going to be one of the major things that wakes up your brain and body. Body temperature will tend to continue to increase through the morning. You'll get that increase in cortisol. That's a healthy increase in cortisol. Body tempera will increase into the afternoon, and then we'll start to drop in the later afternoon. This general contour can be shifted by whether or not you exercise, how often you eat, because of the so-called thermogenetic effects of food. That is, every time you eat there's a slight increase in body temperature and metabolism, but it's not really that significant to throw off this general contour and rhythm, but toward the afternoon around four or five o'clock, most days, depending on time of year, your body temperature will peak, and then it will start to drop. And as your body temperature drops by one to three degrees, and here I'm referring to your core body temperature, not your shell body temperature, you will start to get sleepy and to transition into sleep and to maintain sleep throughout the night. Your body temperature will remain low until you hit that temperature minimum, and then it'll start to come up again. What that means is that when you decide to do sauna, or cold exposure for that matter, it's going to be important. Why? Well, as I mentioned earlier, if you were to make the surface of your body cold, at least in the immediate period after that, your body temperature will increase. So for those of you that are challenged in getting to sleep and are still working on your sleep, remember sleep is the foundation of all mental and physical health and optimal performance, you should try to get really quality sleep of sufficient duration, at least 80% of nights. That should be an ongoing goal throughout your lifespan for a huge number of reasons. Watch the master sleep episode if you'd like to hear are more of those reasons and the mechanisms to make sure that you do that. But in any event, cold exposure late in the evening will start to increase your body temperature again. And that can make it hard for some people to fall asleep. Now, if you're very, very tired, because you've been working hard or training hard or both throughout the day, might not throw off your sleep so much. I've gone through bouts where I'm just so, so busy from morning till night, that the only time I can get into the ice bath or the cold shower is late in the evening and I have no trouble sleeping after that. However, if you have trouble sleeping, I would recommend doing the cold exposure early in the day to match that natural heating, that natural increase in body temperature that occurs across the 24-hour so-called circadian rhythm. Similarly, if you're going to use deliberate heat exposure, you'd be wise to do that later in the day. You'd be wise to do it later in the day because when you get into a warm environment, sure, the surface of your body, the shell, heats up, the core of your body heats up, but then it also activates cooling mechanisms through the preoptic area, and when you get out of that hot environment, sauna or otherwise, your body will continue to cool down. And so many people find that if they do sauna in the later half of the day, or even just before sleep and then take a warmish shower afterwards, then they find it easier to fall asleep. And that makes sense because their body temperature is dropping. And in fact, if your goal is to really promote"}
{"question": "What are the three most important factors that can significantly increase one's risk of all-cause mortality, and how can they be improved through lifestyle changes?", "doc_id": "DTCmprPCDqc_11", "video_id": "DTCmprPCDqc", "video_title": "Dr. Peter Attia: Exercise, Nutrition, Hormones for Vitality & Longevity", "video_header": "All-Cause Mortality: Smoking, Strength, VO2 max", "segment_idx": "11", "time_start": "38:33", "time_end": "44:38", "context": "for longevity and all-risk mortality. And I'd love for you to review a little bit of that for us. I think we all know that we shouldn't smoke because it's very likely that we'll die earlier if we smoke nicotine. I'm neither a marijuana nor a nicotine smoker, so I feel on stable ground there. But anytime we see smoking nowadays, people really want to distinguish between cannabis and nicotine. So I am curious about any differences there in terms of impact on longevity. But in that context, what are the things that anyone and everyone can do, should do, to live longer basically? - How long you got? - Well, you tell me. You tell me. I'd like to live, to be, I'd like my final decade to be between 90 and 100. - Oh no, I meant how long do you, yeah yeah. - No no, I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. - And will we spend from now until you're 90 talking about this? - Well, there's a risk of that. But top contour is fine, I know you've done a lot of content on this, and we will give people links to some of that more in depth content. But, you know, let's say we were on a short flight from here to San Diego, we're in Los Angeles now, and we got take off and landing, and we don't want to kink our neck too much by doing this thing. So if I just said, hey, you know, gimme the extended version of the three by five card. What does that look like? - So, let's start with a couple of the things that you've already highlighted. So smoking, how much does smoking increase your risk of all-cause mortality? And the reason we like to talk about what's called ACM, or all-cause mortality, is it's really agnostic to how you die. And that doesn't always make sense. I mean, if you're talking about, you know, a very specific intervention, like a anti-cancer therapeutic, you really care about cancer-specific mortality or heart-specific mortality. But when we talk about these sort of broad things, we like to talk about ACM. So, you know, using smoking, smoking is approximately a 40% increase in the risk of ACM. - What does that translate to in, that means I'm shortening my life by 40%? - No, it means at any point in time, there's a 40% greater risk that you're going to die relative to a non-smoker and a never smoker. - Got it. - Yeah. So it's important to distinguish. It doesn't mean your lifespan is going to be 40% less. It means at any point in time, standing there, your risk of death is 40% higher. And, by the way, that'll catch up with you, right? At some point that catches up. High blood pressure. It's about a 20 to 25% increase in all-cause mortality. You take something really extreme, like endstage kidney disease. So these are patients that are on dialysis, waiting for an organ. And again, there's a confounder there because there's what's the underlying condition that leads you to that. It's, you know, profound hypertension, you know, significant Type II diabetes that's been uncontrolled. You know, that's enormous, that's about 175% increase in ACM. So the hazard ratio is like 2.75. Type II diabetes is probably about a 1.25 as well. So a 25% increase. So another question is like, how do you improve? So what are the things that improve those? So now here we do this by comparing low to high achievers on other metrics. So if you look at low muscle mass versus high muscle mass, what is the improvement? And it's pretty significant. It's about three X. So if you compare low muscle mass people to high muscle mass people as they age, the low muscle mass people have about a three X hazard ratio, or 200% increase in all-cause mortality. Now, if you look at the data more carefully, you realize that it's probably less the muscle mass fully doing that, and it's more the high association with strength. And when you start to just tease out strength, you can realize that strength could be probably 3 1/2 X as a hazard ratio, meaning about 250% greater risk, if you have low strength to high strength. - And high strength is the ability to move loads at 80 to 90% of one repetition? - It's all defined by given studies. So, the most common things that are used are actually, they're used for the purposes of experiments that make it easy to do. And I don't even think they're the best metrics. So they're usually using like grip strength, leg extensions, and like wall sits, squats, things like that. So how long can you sit in a squatted position at 90 degrees without support, would be a great demonstration of quad strength. A leg extension, you know, how much weight can you hold for how long, relative to body weight, things like that. You know, we have a whole strength program that we do with our patients, we have something called the SMA. So it's the strength metrics assessment. And we put them through 11 tests that are really difficult, you know, like a dead hang is one of them. Like how long can you dead hang your body weight, stuff like that. So we're trying to be more granular in that insight, but tie it back to these principles. If you look at cardio respiratory fitness, it's even more profound. So if you look at people who are in the bottom 25% for their age and sex, in terms of VO2 max, and you compare them to the people that are just at the 50th to 75th percentile, you're talking about a two X difference roughly, in the risk of ACM. If you compare the bottom 25% to the top 2.5%, so you're talking about bottom quarter to the elite, for a given age, you're talking about five X. - Wow! - 400% difference in all-cause mortality. That's probably the single strongest association I've seen for any modifiable behavior. - Incredible. So when you say elite, these are people that are running marathons at a pretty rapid clip. - Not necessarily. It's just like what the VO2 max is for that, like my VO2 max would be in the elite for my age group. My VO2, but again, I'm training very deliberately to make sure that it's in that. So I wouldn't consider myself elite at anything anymore, but I still maintain a VO2 max that is elite for my age. - I consider you an elite physician and podcaster. And guy all around. But true. But in terms of, okay, so- - But the point is like, you don't have to be a world class athlete to be elite here, yeah. - Got it. So maybe we could talk a little bit about"}
{"question": "Does a ketogenic diet lead to reduced thyroid hormone levels, and if so, how can this impact weight gain when returning to a more traditional diet?", "doc_id": "x7qbJeRxWGw_17", "video_id": "x7qbJeRxWGw", "video_title": "How to Control Your Metabolism by Thyroid & Growth Hormone", "video_header": "Ketogenic Diet & Its Effects On Thyroid, Rebound Weight Gain", "segment_idx": "17", "time_start": "45:34", "time_end": "48:35", "context": "And that makes sense because in ketogenic diets, blood glucose levels are very low. And thyroid hormone is secreted in large part in proportion to how much glucose is in the bloodstream and how much that glucose, excuse me, needs to be regulated. So I'm not trying to demonize the ketogenic diet. I think it definitely has its place. There are 22 studies now showing that it can dramatically reduce blood glucose. And about a third of those show that thyroid hormone levels are slightly reduced, sometimes significantly, if not more, in the ketogenic diet that may explain, I want to highlight may explain the fact that when people go back to a more traditional diet if they've been on a ketogenic diet for a long time, that oftentimes they will gain weight very quickly as they bring carbohydrates back into their diet. Some people are cycling between ketogenic and non-ketogenic every three, four days. So-called cyclical ketogenic diet. Some people are staying ketogenic for long periods of time. Some people six days on, one day off. So there's a huge variation there. The point is that carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates in particular, support the healthy production of T3 and T4. And so if you're very low carbohydrate, you're going to have a reduction in T3 and T4. And so if you're going to bring carbohydrates back into your diet, then you might want to do it more gradually. And for those of you that menstruate, and are craving carbohydrates in the early part of the cycle, that is actually associated with having a healthy cycle. If any of you have had a healthy cycle on a ketogenic diet, that would be interesting. Maybe let me know through the comments or point me in the direction of some research if you're aware of it. So as you can start to see, there's this really beautiful interplay between the different hormones, between insulin and glucose, between estrogen and thyroid, between thyroid and blood glucose and the ketogenic diet. It all starts to fit together in ways that make a lot of sense once you understand just kind of the core elements of what the hormones are and the variety of tissues that they work on. The simple version of this is if you haven't had a carbohydrate for a year, then your T3, T4 levels are going to be pretty low. And I'm sure there's some ketonistas out there. They're going to say, wait, no, thyroid hormone levels go up with keto. That might be true for other reasons, indirect reasons related to hormone pathways that are cascade from being in ketosis for long periods of time. Great. But for most people that don't consume any carbohydrate, T3, T4 are going to go down. And when they start to consume foods that require thyroid metabolism in order to work with, to metabolize, then weight gain can sometimes happen more quickly. So it's just something to consider. And it's something to work with carefully if you're going to be cyclic ketogenic, long-term ketogenic. And if you're not ketogenic, and you're consuming carbohydrates. And the three things that we talked about earlier, selenium, tyrosine and iodine, chances are unless there's an underlying condition there that your levels of thyroid are going to be in healthy range. Next, we're going to talk about growth hormone."}
{"question": "Are ecdysteroids, which are found in spinach and other plants, similar enough to cholesterol to be considered a potential supplement for humans, and could they have the same effects as testosterone and other hormones in terms of muscle growth and strength?", "doc_id": "qJXKhu5UZwk_32", "video_id": "qJXKhu5UZwk", "video_title": "The Science of How to Optimize Testosterone & Estrogen", "video_header": "Ecdysteroids: Mimic Mammalian Hormones", "segment_idx": "32", "time_start": "1:47:43", "time_end": "1:51:45", "context": "and I also mean in the scientific literature, one of the things that is new to me, anyway, probably not new to a lot of the gym rats out there, or the people that spend a lot of time on YouTube videos talking about androgens, are these, forgive me for butchering the name again, are these ecdysteroids, so ecdysteroids are molecules that come from things like spinach, believe it or not, that have a lot of similarity to the cholesterol molecule, the one that's being discussed a lot out there right now is something called turkesterone, I wish I knew why it was called turkesterone, someone tell me why it's called turkesterone, does it have anything to do with turkeys? I don't know why it's called turkesterone, perhaps someone will know. In any case, these ecdysteroids are similar enough to cholesterol, and remember, cholesterol is the precursor to testosterone, cortisol, and estrogen, and it appears that some of these ecdysteroids do have bioavailability, or their metabolites are bioavailable, and this was something that, for many years, people talked about whether or not insect hormones or hormones from other species could actually be used by humans or whether or not it would have any effect at all, and it's pretty clear based on a study that I was able to find, there's a paper that came out in 2019, it's a comparative study in the \"Archives of Toxicology,\" this is Isenmann et al., I-S-E-N-M-A-N-N et al., that talks about the ecdysteroids and it was given in conjunction with strength training or no strength training, this was a 10-week intervention, and their conclusion is that these ecdysteroids had a fairly significant, above placebo controls, increases in muscle mass, strength, hypertrophy effects, all the sorts of things that one would expect with increases in androgen, their conclusion of this study is not my conclusion, although I may or may not agree with them, this isn't about my opinions, it's just, I want to be clear, these are their words, not mine, but they say that, in their words, quote, \"Our results strongly suggest \"the inclusion of ecdysteroid \"in the list of prohibited substances.\" So they're saying these things are so powerful that they should be on the list of banned substances, which might be upsetting to some, or some of you might be thinking, well, who cares? The whole issue of augmenting hormones in sports is a very interesting issue, in fact, if you just want a little anecdote about that, I can't reveal names here, of course, but what I learned recently was very surprising to me which is that many athletes in pro sports are taking testosterone, and they are able to do that legally not just because it's available by prescription, but they are allowed to do that under the rules of their sport in the fine print that no one, including me, had ever seen, if they've had an injury, so if athletes are injured, then it opens up the door for certain forms of testosterone augmentation and other types of augmentations that are not available to them if they're not injured, which always makes me wonder now when I see them getting injured whether or not that's an attempt to get some of the support because there's absolutely no question that estrogens and testosterones modulate gene expression, modulate strength, modulate the way the brain works, modulates our relationship to effort and anxiety, et cetera, and while we're talking about supplementation, the effects of supplementation, I would say, in some individuals can be quite dramatic, but they're always, always, always, except in extreme cases, going to be far subtler, excuse me, far more subtle, to use the proper English, far more subtle than would be, for instance, just in injecting testosterone or injecting estrogen, et cetera, so I think we should just be honest and upfront about that. So thus far in terms of talking about optimizing hormones and in the discussion of supplementation, I haven't really talked about things that actually affect the brain directly,"}

I really want to drive home a key point that I think for most people men and women is not obvious but is really important when you say high intensity you don't mean a class or a run uh where you're drenched in sweat and gasping for air at the end necessarily correct let's disambiguate high intensity from what most people think of high intensity which is a really hard workout a tough class where they had me moving the whole time doing a circuit Etc what does the appropriate high-intensity workout look like okay so uh if I talk about true high-intensity interval training if you're a runner it's going to the track and doing sets of 4800s okay so 400 a lap yep 800 two laps right so you're looking at between a minute and four minutes of of hard work at 80% or more with variable recovery so that's why use a track as a as an example so if you do one lap and you're like uh I'm going to walk half a lap and then do it again that's adequate recovery tough yeah it's hard right but it's not like you're going to be there for 90 minutes doing as many 400s as you can because you have that variable recovery it might take half an hour to 40 minutes max and then you're gassed out can't do it anymore if you're looking at a gym situation I look I I like to look at something like every minute on the minute where you might be doing uh 10 deadlifts at moderate intensity weight and it Tak 10 repetitions yeah so it takes you 50 seconds to complete that then you have 10 seconds to move to the next exercise that might be thrusters so you know a squat clean thrusters so it's a squat pulling the weight up overhead so you're doing maybe eight of those in that minute and you might have 10-second recovery you go to the next exercise that might be um kettle bell swings and you're doing explosive kettle bell swings and you'll finish you know 10 seconds to go you go to the fourth exercise I don't know toes to bar or some other kind of vup some other high intensity and then you have one minute completely off so you've had four minutes of really heavy work with maybe 10 seconds to move to the next exercise one minute completely off and then you repeat that three times and this is high-intensity interval training this is not what you would consider resistance training for sake of building muscle or strength correct you're using these loads these machines the the pike you know hanging from the bar and bring your knees up or lsit or something as a tool to get the heart rate up continually y y very different than resistance training the mo the way most people think about it correct so this is the cardiovascular high-intensity interval training and the subset of that is Sprint interval training and this is something that's really really hard and people don't get it I don't necessarily mean running it can be whatever mode of activity but it's 30 seconds or less as as you can go so this is your N9 or 10 on your rating and perceived exertion 110% it's Max effort on the rower on the airdine bike running if you like of those the skier the battle ropes battle ropes are big so 30 seconds all out then rest what 10 15 seconds repeat no you want to because now we're looking at that top end where we want uh regeneration of your ATP you know all of that system and central nervous system recovery so this is 30 seconds all out could be two or three minutes of recovery oh nice because I'm not looking at Tata where you're 20 seconds on 20 seconds off because that's not the intensity we want we want you to go all out and recover well enough to be able to go all all out again you're not leaving anything in the tank so those are what I mean by high-intensity interval training or or when you're looking at polarizing your cardiovascular work that's the top end those are the two examples of your top end and then your recovery is that long slow walking on another day where you're not going and doing a tempo run you're not doing a 5k easy jog because that put you in that moderate intensity and if I heard you correctly earlier you are suggesting most women do one or two days of high-intensity interval training plus 3 to four days of resistance training for sake of building strength and muscle which looks very different it's more warm up do a couple work sets you know two to four work sets of you know an overhead press two or four work sets of maybe a barbell curl two or four sets of some dips or whatever whatever um one's you know personal choices yeah okay got it um very different Far and Away different than what most people men or women are doing out there which is um a lot of StairMaster treadmill jogging maybe some Lifting for hypertrophy because I look"}

skin plaque regular periods regular periods is that um you know I I get a lot of questions about PCOS yeah um and you're the first person we've had on this podcast that's really qualified to talk about PCOS in a real way um so here we're talking about too many androgens cysts on the ovary irregular ovarian me uh excuse me I keep saying that ovulatory menstrual cycle um what are some other indicators and do you recommend that women start taking Androgen blockers or or I mean how do seems to be a lot of PCOS out there I'm hearing about it a lot so glad you asked about this so PCOS is one of those really poorly understood conditions that gets it kind of flows flies below the radar until a woman wants to get pregnant or she's got some other issue that drives her to a physician the problem is that it is a syndrome right so polycystic ovary syndrome sometimes polycystic ovarian syndrome and syndromes don't necessarily fit together into a really clear diagnostic criteria so in this instance there are three different criteria that we look for so cists on the ovaries having um clinical manifestations of hyperandrogenism so that could be heroism acne other things and then usually irregular periods and the way that that's defined at least by the uh latest criteria is having a period every 35 days or less so typical cycle length 28 days 35 days you know you're skipping a period here and there so those are the those are the criteria that we use to diagnose PCOS there are about four different systems out there in the literature for diagnosing PCOS which is where it starts to get confusing so there's some women who have nosis on their ovaries but they've got heroism and they've got irregular periods could you define ha sism her sism is increased hair growth usually in places that you don't want it so for women it can be you know kind of male pattern they might notice it on their breasts on their chest um um and then there's of course a a familial quality to that like I was just looking at a paper last night looking at ises and how much heroism they have and whether this is related to CAG repeats on the Androgen receptor do they get um not Israelis but um do women who um who might have PCOS experience um endogenic alopecia so hair loss that sort of of the quote unquote male pattern baldness of course it's Androgen pattern baldness as opposed to male we're talking about testosterone DHD related sometimes you know this is where I'm going to invoke clinical experience rather than uh what I've seen in the literature women definitely can have some androgenic um alpia I tend to see it later in life but this is an important point because we think of PCOS as you know I was just talking about it in teenage years like wouldn't it be nice to know that you have this phenotype and you're at risk for all the things that people are at risk for and we haven't talked about glucose and ins yet we should what we know is that pcus is not just a problem in terms of irregular periods and then difficulty getting pregnant so those are mostly problems in your 20s 30s early 40s but it is a massive risk factor for cardom metabolic disease as you get older so many people tend to pigeon hole PCS is a problem of reproductive age we have to be thinking of it over the entire female life cycle and I would say it's even more important to consider it over the age of 50 you know average age of menopause is 51 to 52 because we know that that elevated testosterone the high androgens are probably the greatest cardio metabolic driver of disease for women with PCS wow now one other thing I want to mention and I still have my notes that we're going to talk about microbiome testing because that's such a fun subject what I was taught to do again saying this with so much love for the people who have taught me how to do medicine what I was taught to do is that if you have a woman with PCOS you make the diagnosis you measure her testosterone you see if she has acne blah blah blah you asked that woman one question do you want to get pregnant or not so then you have these women with PCS who get started on a birth control pill if they don't want to get pregnant if they want get pregnant then you help them get pregnant by addressing some of these PCS issues like maybe you give them Clomid or you do something to make them ovulate more frequently that is the way that most conventional medicine approaches this and it does women at gigantic disservice so one of the things I'm speaking into is the gender gap that exists so I my feeling is that the research money that goes into women's health is abysmal compared to what goes into Men's Health really and I think that's changing but there's also a huge lack of awareness of sex and gender differences when it comes to the way that we construct clinical trials and other experiments well that's absolutely true I mean I sit on I've sat on NIH review panels for more than a decade now I'm a regular standing member which is only to say that I see the research as it's being proposed yes and now it's required no Grant will get funded without sex as a biological variable and here I'm I'm by the way folks this is sex biological sex the noun not sex the verb both are super interesting obviously but um when we say sex as a biological variable meaning even even if it's a study on mice where did that start though that didn't start that long ago it must have been I think we can thank I don't want to misattribute here I think we can thank Francis Collins for insisting on this amen Francis and Bernardine hey Bernardine Healey has done so much to help us but you know she made the Women's Health Initiative which I hope we'll get to which just a hot mess like so confusing the data that came out of that and these trials are long and so the data are only now starting to emerge so just to be clear I mean I have a a question that I don't think is going to take us off track but this is I'm going to posee this question as a hypothesis because I think it's likely to be uh a little bit of a of a not a barbed wire question but maybe like a prickly question when people first hear it but it's posed as a hypothesis you you mentioned some of the psychosocial stress issues based on at the organiz ational level institutional level societal level maybe right down to the family and and just life that are biasing Health outcomes for the worse in female populations okay you refer to as the patriarchy I'm just trying to put make sure that we're both talking about the same thing and that's non-exhaustive I realize that's just a subset of the issues I'm also hearing there's a lot more PCOS which is hyper androgenization of the ovary in there we're talking about you mentioned you know excess testosterone which females naturally have more testosterone than they do estrogen anyway but we're talking about elevated levels here's a hypothesis one hypothesis would be that the increased androgens and the P PCOS are a consequence of the psychosocial conditions that are I don't want to say forcing but are biasing the need for females to um think behav react act in certain ways to survive let alone Thrive is that a I don't say this for any kind of political correctness hypothesis this is a in my this would be a fun interesting and I think important study to run right depending on stress and the conditions the specific type of stress do females underproduce or overproduce androgens or is it a neutral effect does that make make sense I love this question so let me just paraphrase the last part of it to make sure I got it it sounds like what you're asking is could PCOS or at least some phenotypes of PCOS be a response to what I'm calling patriarchy and then you had a second part to it which is do healthy women like what is their production of testosterone like is that right yes and and with the acknowledgement I mean you're the expert here um you're the physician clinician and expert in hormones and I'm not but with the understanding that absolute levels of hormones are interesting but perhaps not as interesting as the ratios of testosterone to estrogen so when we're talking about excess testosterone we're really not talking about oh women making a lot of testosterone because frankly they already make a lot like then most people weren't aware of that I wasn't aware that women make more testosterone than estrogen right and so it's not saying that testosterone in women is bad or is always a reaction to the environment yes but when it becomes um super physiological or hyper elevated is I could imagine all sorts of social conditions that would create that um so in males and females but here we're talking about PCOS and females in particular so I'd love for you to speculate um should we run the study we should totally run the study because I don't know the answer I suspect that you're on to something it may not explain all of the women with PCOS because as I metion there's a lot of different phenotypes but I think it could explain a significant portion and you know you're almost you're saying if we look at the gene environment interface this environmental influence of having being someone who's got power over you if if pcus was a response to that the way that we treat it would be completely different so on the one hand I want to be careful not to dismiss the suffering and experience of women with PCOS I've got a lot of women with PCOS in my family and it is there's so much pain and suffering you know especially if you want to have a baby and you try for years and you just can't ovulate on the other hand I read a paper recently and maybe we could site this that compares the phenotype of a woman with pcus to a man who is"}
{"question": "What are the key differences between healthy and unhealthy breathing patterns?", "doc_id": "x4m_PdFbu-s_6", "video_id": "x4m_PdFbu-s", "video_title": "How to Breathe Correctly for Optimal Health, Mood, Learning & Performance | Huberman Lab Podcast", "video_header": "High Altitudes, Oxygen & Breathing", "segment_idx": "6", "time_start": "40:36", "time_end": "47:12", "context": "and what you plan to do next, whether or not that's sleep or exercise or mental work, et cetera. Before going any further, however, there is something I want to touch on. Because even though not everyone will experience this, I think enough people experience it that it is of interest, and now's the right time to touch into what happens when you go up to a very high altitude, meaning why it's hard to breathe when you get up to high altitudes. So if you're close to sea level, you are getting out of the optimal balance of oxygen in the air you breathe. As you ascend in altitude-- so let's say you go to 6,000 feet or 10,000 or maybe even 11,000 feet above sea level. Or maybe you're one of those rare individuals that climbs Denali, or you climb Mount Everest, and you get up there, and you notice that most people are going to wear an oxygen mask. Why is it that you need an oxygen mask at those very high altitudes or when people do these very high altitude skydives that they need oxygen way up high? Well, a lot of people will say, oh, there's not much oxygen up there. The air is thinner. OK, well, perhaps a better way to think about it is that, remember when we were talking about the mechanical aspects of breathing and the fact that the lungs don't really move themselves, that they have the muscles, the diaphragm and the intercostal muscles to move them? Well, a lot of the reason why your lungs can fill so readily with air is that when you don't have much air in your lungs, there's very low air pressure in your lungs relative to outside you. So what we mean then is if you were to open up your mouth or your nose and breathe in, that is, breathe in through your nose or mouth, what's going to happen is air is going to move from high pressure to low pressure. So it's very easy to fill your lungs. Even though you need those muscles to move the various things around that allow your lungs to fill, the air is going to go from high pressure to low pressure. So for those of you listening, I just took a big inhale through my nose. And then when you exhale, you're basically taking the lungs from a state in which the pressure is really high in the lungs, high pressure, like a balloon that's full-- and the pressure in your lungs when your lungs are full is higher than the air outside. So it's pretty easy to expel that air through the nose or mouth. When you're at high altitudes, the air pressure is lower. And so what happens is when the air pressure is lower outside your body and your lungs are not full of air, you don't have that really steep gradient of high pressure outside the body to low pressure inside your lungs. And so you actually have to put a lot more effort into breathing air into your lungs. You have to really exert a lot of force. You have to get the diaphragm, those intercostal muscles working really hard. You might even find that your shoulders are lifting with each breath because you really have to generate a lot of force to get enough air and oxygen into your lungs. Now, an important principle to understand is that in humans, and in some other species, but really what we're talking about now is humans, when you inhale, that's an active process. You really need to use those muscles of the intercostals and the diaphragm in order to inflate the lungs. But the whole process is made easier when air pressure outside your body is higher than it is in your lungs because then they're going to fill up really readily. Exhaling, at least for humans, is a passive thing. You just have to relax the diaphragm and relax the intercostals and let the rib cage kind of fall back to its original position. So inhaling is active, and exhaling is passive. And so what happens is if you're at a high altitude and the air pressure is very low, then you have to put a lot of energy into breathing air into your lungs to get an equivalent amount of oxygen into your lungs and then into the bloodstream. So that's why when you arrive at a high altitude location, for the first few days, you're going to feel lightheaded maybe a headache. You're also going to have more buildup of carbon dioxide in your system. And so the whole balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide is going to be disrupted. I mention all that because, yes, indeed, there are some changes in the atmospheric gases at high altitudes, and that can impact how much oxygen you can bring into your system, into your tissues. But I've heard many explanations of why it's hard to breathe or why you feel lousy at altitude. Well, you just discovered one reason, which is that you don't have that steep high pressure to low pressure gradient from the outside of the body into the inside of the body. The converse is also true. If you've been at altitude for a few days and you've had the opportunity to adjust-- a lot of athletes, for instance, will go train at altitude. It's hard for them in the first days or weeks, and then they get really good at training at altitude. There are a number of different adaptations that occur in terms of the amount of oxygen that can be carried in the blood by hemoglobin and the interactions between carbon dioxide and hemoglobin and oxygen that allow more oxygen to be delivered to the tissues, such that, at altitude, you can function just normally. But if you then move very quickly from altitude-- say, you've been training at 8,000 feet or 10,000 feet. You've been hiking up at that high level, and you've adapted, and you come down to sea level. Well, for about two to five days, you're going to feel like an absolute beast. You're going to be able to essentially deliver far more oxygen to your muscles per breath. In part, that is because of the way that the hemoglobin and the oxygen that it's carrying has been altered when you were at high altitude. But it's also because when you were at that high altitude, those intercostal muscles and those diaphragms got trained up quite a bit and allowed you to generate more air volume for every breath. In other words, those muscles got stronger, and you got more efficient at driving the phrenic nerve consciously to really breathe in a lot of oxygen so you don't feel lightheaded, headache, et cetera. OK, so that's a little bit of an aside. But it's an important aside, I believe, because, A, it answers a question a lot of people ask and they a lot of people wonder about and, B, because it incorporates both the mechanical aspects of breathing and the chemical aspects of breathing. I realize it's a little bit of a unusual circumstance. But now if anyone asks you why it's hard to breathe at altitude, you know it has to do with this lack of a high pressure to low pressure gradient across the body and with the atmosphere outside you. It's also an opportunity for me to say that if you do find yourself at altitude and you have a headache or you're feeling like you just can't catch your breath, spending some time really consciously trying to draw in larger breaths of air, as much as that might seem fatiguing and you'll be short of breath, it will allow you to adapt more quickly. And a little bit later in the episode, we'll touch on a few methods, including deliberate hyperventilation combined with some breath holds, that can allow you to deliver more oxygen to the cells immediately upon arriving at altitude so you don't get quite as much headache, disorientation, and so on. So leaving breathing at altitude aside let's all come back down to the same conceptual level. We can ask ourselves, for instance, what is healthy breathing, and what is unhealthy breathing?"}
{"question": "What specific brain regions and mechanisms are involved in the action of vasopressin in mediating social behavior and pair bonding in rodents?", "doc_id": "ccrbE0QHy94_13", "video_id": "ccrbE0QHy94", "video_title": "Dr. Karen Parker: The Causes & Treatments for Autism", "video_header": "Vasopressin, Social Interaction; Voles & Parenthood", "segment_idx": "13", "time_start": "1:17:09", "time_end": "1:27:04", "context": "so you told us this is a molecule that chemically is very similar to oxytocin um is it manufactured in the human brain and body yes okay do we know a subset of the sites that it's known to be produced and where it's of its actions are and you mentioned the kidney and the anti-diuretic hormone um roles but within the brain like what brain areas have neurons that make vasopressin well or have the receptors for I mean The receptors are all over are all over the brain and again it varies depending on the species and you know the way the receptors are measured or in postmortem tissue right which can be very difficult to get good samples right and so we need to have that caveat going in um but yeah I mean it's it's made in the hypothalamus um and it's released all over the brain and there is vasor press and receptors all over the brain right and um what's really interesting about vaser press and I always sort of joke that oxytocin you know always saw its day in the sun if you will and the vasopress was sort of the stepchild that was like left you know sort of behind and and the reason why I find this fascinating is again like I think back to my you know my my roots as a you know evolutionary biologist behavioral neuroscientist and what was interesting is that there were studies in the early to mid 1990 showing that vasopressin was critical for male social behavior and so um there was work you know there was a variety of people and I I think Rob Minka mentioned this on his on on the podcast he did about you know there's a a group of people like Sue Carter Larry young Tom inso some of these early people and they gave Vasa pressen to male Prairie voles and V vasopressin was what induced um pair bonding um with a a female mate and also paternal care and and as I recall those experiments were done in the context of looking at um polygamy versus monogamy of these Prairie VES um Prairie VES versus like a different species so same um genus but a different species so it might be a Montaine V or you know highly related but these other species so Perales are monogamous the males uh well I mean that was the 50% divorce right yeah that was I don't think it's that bad but I think they're doing better than we are as a species that's true we should look to them for pointers and all the divorce folks are saying wait why' you say better I have some divorce friends that have said divorce is like the greatest thing so we always say like doing better doing worse right um anyway that's a whole other podcast um and certainly not the hubman Lab podcast but or maybe it is but um or will be but yeah my understanding is is that you have certain vs that mate with almost exclusively with one other V for their entire lifespan and then you have other vs located elsewhere um that in those colonies they mate with lots of different well so the males and females have lots of different partners um rais young with lots of different partners mating with lots of different partners and that if you give Vasa presson then you can make the I was want to call them polyamorous but I don't know if they love each other I'm going to answer for more and assume they love each other the polygamous moles not polyamorous but polygamous moles then become monogamous well I yeah I would say that is probably not the take-home message so the take-home message would be they had let's say that there was like the good vs right which are the Prairie VES and they were the ones that formed these monogamous parir bonds dad participates in paternal care with Mom they co- ra babies together and then Dad chases off Intruders right and then there's the more Ace social vs and so these are like the Montaine VES um and um we'll we'll see it's a complicated story but there's these Montaine vs where um males and females live separately females like maybe live on the male's territory the male mes with a few different females absolutely doesn't provide any paternal care at all mom raises babies by herself right so that's these are really the like 1950s versus 2020s yes yes to be to to broadly stereotype to broadly stereotype and if you give okay so for Prairie voles they're sort of primed to form bonds and to be the males to be good daddies if you will and all you have to do is give them a single injection of vasopressin and you know or you can give an antagonist and usually the way they form the bond is through mating right so they you put them with a female they mate they cohabit for a bit there's been all kinds of parametric studies I I can't remember how many hours it takes to form a parabond um but then you can do these things called partner preference tests and then you can say here's the guy that you made it with here's this guy you don't know and you can do it for males you can do it for females and they pick their partner they choose to go hang out with their partner the Montaine BS you know either after meting with somebody May either be equal or maybe they'll even go spend time with the new individual so the cleanest story was that Prairie voles are monogamous Mont voles are not monogamous but in the prairie vs you could give vasor pressen instead of mated cohabitation and you could turn on a like you know a bond with somebody after only living with them for a very short period of time right um or you could induce paternal behavior and I was working with a V species in grad school I think the most interesting scientific experience that I've ever had right and you and I both know this right when you're young you're actually the person doing the work right as you become you know the head of your lab you're mostly writing grants and giving talks right and then you get to hear about the super cool things that every in your lab is doing right eventually the the members of your laboratory kick you out of the lab they literally say like get out of here you're leaving things in the wrong place whereas initially you're telling them hey that's in the wrong place within a year or two for me I think it took about four or five years but by about year six right I was um demoted to my office to just write grants and write Pap I was told that one time I was back there and I tried to waigh and I was like so excited what they were working on and they basically just said go write grants and bring in more money right like that was kind of their attitude like we get to be the ones who get to do the cool stuff so back when I got to actually do the science um I remember I had this species where and I and again I told you I came at this from an evolutionary perspective so these were called meadowes and I found them very interesting so when I showed up in my thesis advisor lab she I said I really want to study oxytocin and vasopressin and I really want to study VES and I know you have a v species and she said why I don't have prairie vs I have these meow voles and I'm studying them because they're so sensitive to light and they changed their behavior based on light and I she said well you can do what you want but our grants basically have to have a circadian component and so she said you got to work that in but then we kind of struck this deal so I was hanging out in the animal rooms and I thought it was really fascinating so she had animals that were either on short day lengths or long day lengths so the mimicking some um summer and winter and I was noticing that on winter day lengths the the males were hanging out with the females and when the female had a litter he was like participating and I was like whoa these are not supposed to be monogamous animals and so I went into the field research and they were doing all these radio telemetry studies and so like if you I we should probably explain what those are putting a little transmitter um under the skin it's painless for the animal but that allows the researcher to um monitor the behavior of the animal remotely without having to you know put them in cages and stuff so and so this is like under field conditions and vs are everybody's favorite snack so they have like a very limited lifespan in the wild I mean like on the order of months and and so like if you have a short lifespan like you should just keep reproducing right and so what was interesting is at the end of the summer days as you're going into winter territories collapse and males are found with females and they co- ra babies it makes sense if it's you're going to have a litter and mom needs to get up to go eat you need somebody to sit there and warm those babies or they're going to die because they're going to freeze to death right so I started saying like wow I think these metales are good dats like I'm noticing this and so I told my thesis adviser I want to study how oxytocin invasor press can maybe this is involved in tracking these evolutionary mating strategies and so again like the coolest experience I ever had was on these males that were housed under short day length so they were like winter males um I was able to put Vaso pressent directly into their brains and and it was like turning on a light switch and they ran around the cage picked up all these babies put them in a nest and huddled over them and if you put a placebo into their brain nothing happened and so to me I always filed that away in you know in the back of my mind of like wow Vasa pressin is this really interesting hormone um and maybe someday I will I did a postto on something else but it was always you know back in the back of my mind of I really want to return to this it's so incredible that a eight amino acid long peptide could basically turn these um relatively negligent fathers into very attentive fathers yes yeah it was fascinating right that I mean it just speaks to the power of the peptide baso pressent also speaks to the power of brain circuitry it also speaks to the idea that brain circuitry is often sitting latent in the background you know ready to be activated that it's not just about neuroplasticity and building up a new circuit that some forms of neuroplasticity are about unveiling what's what's already there and that peptides can act like switches um which you know kind of makes sense on the one hand but um I've never heard of a result as dramatic as that so um I'm presuming you're going to tell us"}

have ideas and then I'll write them down I constantly am writing things down voice memos into my phone I have a method of capture where I basically try and just grab everything and then filter out what's useful do you have a process like that for for gleaning ideas a little bit I do now so um when when G Shen and I started this research on procrastination she had she had come to me she was a very creative doctoral student and she said I have my best ideas when I'm procrastinating and it was it was one of those moments where I didn't believe her but I thought it was an interesting enough idea that it was worth exploring and I said show me get let's get some data let's see if we can we can test this and she ended up um Gathering data in a Korean company where she surveyed people on how often they procrastinate and then got their supervisors to rate their creativity and sure enough found that people who procrastinate sometimes were rated as more creative than people who rarely do like me the procrastinators and I remember asking her what about the chronic procrastinators and she's like I don't know they never filled out my survey yeah as I recall from that paper there's inverted u-shaped function with procrastination on the vertical axis and and um uh and creativity on the horizontal axis flipped sorry okay so um explain to me then the relationship between procrastination and creativity Yeah so basically the the peak of creativity is in the middle of procrastination ah okay got it and yeah there's a there's an upside down U curve there and so then I thought this was fascinating so then you know we go into the lab to say can we replicate this can we control it in an experiment and the hardest part of that was how do you randomly assign people to procrastinate like to my knowledge never been done before and we eventually figured out that we could give people a bunch of task to do and then tempt them with highly entertaining YouTube videos uh that were sort of placed on their screen and we put different numbers of YouTube videos there so that uh you know if there's only one you're not tempted to procrastinate much if there are four you're probably going to get sucked into a little bit of a YouTube spiral if there are eight uh you might be putting off the test that's much less exciting than than you know watching Jimmy Kimble's Mean Tweets for example and this was done in a fairly naturalistic environment for these people are people are on a a computer they're they're asked to you know to solve some creative problems that look pretty similar to what you might do in your job and then we're going to score your creativity later and um it turned out that the people who were attempted to procrastinate moderately um ended up generating the most creative ideas so why is that um there are a couple things that happen and you have to look at both sides of the curve so what's wrong with the procrastinators and also what happens to the the extreme procrastinators um and in both cases what happens is um you end up with a little bit of tunnel vision so um when I dive right into a task I'm stuck with my first ideas and I don't wait long enough to incubate and get my best ideas I'm less likely to reframe the problem I'm less likely to access remote knowledge because I'm just I'm just diving right in and meanwhile The Chronic procrastinators um end up in the same boat because they don't get started until the last minute and so they have to rush ahead with the easiest idea to implement as opposed to really developing the most novel idea and meanwhile the the people in the middle who you know are starting to feel that pressure of of like wow I you know I kind of Spun my wheels for 10 minutes watching a bunch of YouTube videos I'm running out of time for this task they still have enough time to work on the ideas that were active in the back of their minds and and that gives them a shot at more novel ideas so I've tried to adopt this to answer your question I've tried to adopt this as my process now to say I will still dive into a project ahead of schedule but I will not commit to an idea until I've let it incubate for a few weeks and I'm working on other things whereas an earlier version of me like when I'd sit down to write a book um as soon as I had the book idea I would start writing on day one now I have the idea I file it away and I give myself at least a month before I begin drafting um and I think it feels less productive but it's far more creative what are your thoughts about some of what you described being an unconscious way of seeding the mind and the unconscious with an idea so for instance uh let's take a a School academic scenario where um students get an assignment and the assignment is contained within a folder and it just says assignment okay and it's a doe on a particular date and it says do on that particular date and they're given the folder but they have no sense of what the assignment is you can imagine one category of procrastinator that will take that thing and put it down and avoid looking at it entirely versus another category of procrastinator that will Flip Flip it open and take a look at okay this is going to be an essay on you know um I don't know something about economic theory in the late 1700s close it and then procrastinate there is an idea which I frankly I subscribe to a little bit um because we recently did this series on Mental Health not Mental Illness but mental health with Dr Paul kti where he talked extensively about the unconscious and how the unconscious mind is always working with ideas things that we are concerned about performance these sorts of things even if we're not aware of them um what what are your thoughts about the creativity that seeded by slight procrastination being related to actually knowing what you're procrastinating on specifically I I think it turns out to be I don't want to say essential but critical so one of the things we found is in order for moderate procrastination to fuel creativity you have to be intrinsically motivated by the thing you're procrastinating on interesting and so what what happens is if if you if you're bored for example by the topic you're not going to open the folder you're not going to start thinking about it at all it's not going to begin you're not going to do any subconscious processing you're not going to have any unexpected connections um between this topic and something else you've learned uh learned about or or been curious about if you're interested in the problem then when you put it off you're much more likely to still keep it active in the back of your mind and that's when when you begin to to see you know I I imagine you could explain the biology of this um I I imagine for example there's um there's probably um there are probably more neural networks um that are connecting um you probably get you get access to ideas that previously would have been sort of separate nodes and so I think that you you want to know what the topic is right you don't want to just see the blank assignment but you also have to find a reason that this is exciting to you um otherwise you're going to avoid it as opposed to letting it percolate that brings us to the topic of intrinsic motivation um and I'd like to"}

from 0 to one and from 3 to 5 Etc rarely if ever do we hear about the maturational stages of adulthood and the core conflicts that we all have to go through um you know perhaps not exactly from age 45 to 50 or 50 to 55 or 75 to 80 and so forth but that life as it were might be a series of of um trying to make it through specific milestones and when we don't make it through a milestone um problems arise sure sure you described the first half of life as one in which we're kind of foraging more or less for most people unconscious of how our parental influences or family influences um set about certain patterns that may or may not be healthy for us and then at some point some event comes um often times a painful event but that but it could be a joyous event like the birth of a child or something like that and all of a sudden we get hit Square in the face with the work that we need to do would you say that the second half of life is one in which we because of our life experience and because of some awareness and yet because also our brain is yes still plastic but it takes more work than when we're kids to to modify our brain circuitry that we you know that we have to set about this juggling Act of still trying to understand the self while still bringing the self that we have into the world right we don't we don't really get to pause go to the shop and um come out a year later in most cases um so regardless of whether or not somebody is 10 15 20 50 or 80 years old how do we know what our work is then like how do we best know like what to to focus on because it can beit be a bit overwhelming to to think about like tackling all of this sure sure well let me say first of all many years ago I was when I was still teaching at a university um I taught a course on life stages and for one of the papers I asked the students to imagine two stages ahead of them so if they were typically 18 to 22 let's say to imagine themselves in their 40s and try to write about their in their 40s and the assignment completely failed Al although it it was made useful uh for the classroom discussion because all of them imagine in their 40s they would have this perfect marriage their adolescent children will would adore them and they would be in these satisfying careers despite everything we'd read everything we' talked about as a time of turbulence and disappointment and and and so forth and and it was a complete failure so it it's hard for us to imagine that we too will go through these similar kinds of things but usually we do and some of this is triggered by roles in one's life a lot of it's determined by our own aging of the body and so forth so for example the last stage in Ericson's um um discussion in so-called old age is the conflict between Despair and integrity and I remember reading that when I was young I wondering what did he really mean by that now I know that in a very personal way despair is one sees friends die one sees Avenues in your life closed that you can't possibly do that you're confronted with the unlived life or the mistakes you made you're dealing with loss of functions of the body you're you're facing your mortality and so forth and so on and how could you not despair in the face of that well at the same time there's again the summons to accountability what now is life asking of you how are you to show up today in in this changed environment you see so you know the the stages of life you know and Shakespeare wrote about the seven stages of life I think Ericson had eight stages and again underneath this these things happen right and often one doesn't realize it one reads about it somehow it's sort of like when you're young yes mortal I understand I'm mortal but you know that happens to people out there you know it's not part of my DNA you see well it is and sooner or later life is going to unfold unless it's cut off in some way you know and uh I remember reading when I was in graduate school um a saying in ancient Greece that I saw in several different environments and it said best of all is not to have been born second best is to have died young and I thought gee how awful that is right well I think I've understood why they were saying that if you if if you're born into the veil of Tears so to speak you're born into suffering you're you're you're born into mortality you're born into loss and so forth if you're going to live you're going to go through some of those if you live long enough you'll go through the loss of people you love and care about you may outlive your children as I've had an experience and sooner or later you know life will take you to these difficult places and what are you going to do then who are you then and how are you going to address that and that's where the issue of Integrity came in I think Ericson was was right on that to in to be a person of integrity means to integrate something to pull back one's stuff and and sense this is who I am and and this is where I stand Visa this dilemma it's why I said the Practical question is how now am I to live my life in the face of this situation that's a task that comes to each of us at at some place in our life and that never goes away let's talk about death okay I've"}
{"question": "What specific genes are responsible for controlling neural connectivity and allowing for the formation of new connections in the brain, particularly in the context of speech and language development?", "doc_id": "LVxL_p_kToc_8", "video_id": "LVxL_p_kToc", "video_title": "Dr. Erich Jarvis: The Neuroscience of Speech, Language & Music | Huberman Lab Podcast #87", "video_header": "Genes for Speech & Language", "segment_idx": "8", "time_start": "31:40", "time_end": "35:46", "context": "that in many ways are similar, perhaps not in their exact wiring, but in their basic contour of wiring. And genes that are expressed in both sets of neural circuits in very distinct species that are responsible for these phenomenon we're calling speech and language. What sorts of things are those genes controlling? I could imagine they were controlling the wiring of connections between brain areas. You know, essentially a map of, you know, of a circuit, basically like an engineer would design a circuit for speech and language, nature designed the circuit for speech and language, but presumably other things too. Like the ability to connect motor patterns within the throat of muscles within the throat, or in the control of the tongue. I mean, what are these genes doing? - You're pretty good, yeah. You've made some very good guesses there that makes sense. So, yes, one of the things that differ in the speech pathways of us and these song pathways of birds is some of the connections are fundamentally different than the surrounding circuits, like a direct cortical connection from the areas that control vocalizations in the cortex or the motor neurons that control the larynx, in humans or the syrinx in birds. And so we actually made a prediction that since some of these connections differ, we're going to find genes that control neural connectivity, and that specialize in that function, that differ. And that's exactly what we found. Genes that control what we call axon guidance and form neuronal connections, and what was interesting, it was sort of in the opposite direction that we expected. That is, some of these genes, actually, a number of them that control neural connectivity were turned off in the speech circuit, all right. And it didn't make sense to us at first until we started to realize the function of these genes are to repel connections from forming, so repulsive molecules. And so when you turn them off, they allow certain connections to form that normally would have not formed. So by turning it off, you gain a function for speech, right? Other genes that surprised us were genes involved in calcium buffering neuroprotection, like Parvalbumin or heat-shock proteins, so when your brain gets hot, these proteins turn on. And we couldn't figure out for a long time, why is that the case? And then the idea popped to me one day and said, ah, when I heard the larynx is the fastest firing muscles in the body, all right. In order to vibrate sound and modulate sound in the way we do, you have to control, you have to move those muscles, you know, three to four to five times faster than just regular walking or running. And so when you stick electrodes in the brain areas that control learned vocalizations in these birds and I think in humans as well, those neurons are firing at a higher rate to control these muscles. And so what is that going to do? You're going to have lots of toxicity in those neurons, unless you upregulate molecules that take out the extra load that is needed to control the larynx. And then finally, a third set of genes that are specialized in these speech circuit are involved in neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity, meaning allowing the brain circuits to be more flexible so you can learn better. And why is that? I think learning how to produce speech is a more complex learning ability than say learning how to walk or learning how to do tricks and jumps and so forth that dogs do. - Yeah, it's interesting as you say that, because I realize that many aspects of speech are sort of reflexive. I'm not thinking about each word I'm going to say, they just sort of roll out of my mouth, hopefully with some forethought. We both know people that seem to speak, think less, fewer synapses between their brain and their mouth than others, right. - Yes. - A lot of examples out there, and some people are very deliberate in their speech, but nonetheless, that much of speech has to be precise. And some of it less precise. In terms of plasticity of speech and the ability to learn multiple languages,"}
{"question": "How can I strike a balance between rewarding myself for achieving intermediate goals to avoid burnout, while still maintaining the motivation to pursue long-term objectives?", "doc_id": "vA50EK70whE_42", "video_id": "vA50EK70whE", "video_title": "How to Increase Motivation & Drive", "video_header": "Intermittent Halting of Celebration; Enjoy Your Wins, But Not All of Them", "segment_idx": "42", "time_start": "1:14:19", "time_end": "1:18:31", "context": "occurs when you hit the milestones that you want to achieve is to occasionally remove reward subjectively, let's say you set out a goal of making I'm gonna make this quantitative with respect to finances 'cause it just is an easy description but this could also be in sport. This could be in school. This could be in music could be in anything creative endeavors but let's say you set out a certain financial goal or let's say you wanna get a certain number of followers on whatever social media platform as you reach each one of those goals. You should know now that the amount of dopamine is not going to peak. It's actually going to diminish and make you crave more the key to avoiding that crash but to still keep it in healthy levels that will allow you to continue. Your pursuit is as you are, stair casing toward your goal. Maybe that's dollars, maybe that's followers maybe that's grades maybe that's some other metric it's metals or trophies. You actually want to blunt the reward response for some of those intermediate goals. Now I'm not telling you should celebrate your wins but I'm telling you not to celebrate all of them. Whereas a good friend of mine who recently fortunately for him had a great financial success. He asked me and somebody else a good friend of mine. Who's very tuned into dopamine reward schedules understands how they work at a really deep level. And he said,\" I don't know what to do next.\" And we said,\" Oh, well, that's simple, You should just give most of it away.\" And this wasn't a ploy to receive any of the money ourselves. This was really about reducing the impact of that reward. Now hopefully giving them money away. If you already have enough of it would be something that was rewarding in and of itself. But if you're a student who's pursuing goals in university or you're an athlete, who's pursuing goals it actually makes sense from a rational perspective. Once you understand these mechanisms to hit a new high point of performance, or to get that A-plus or a for you if it's an A-minus, et cetera and to tell yourself, okay, that was good. But to actually actively blunt the reward to not go and celebrate too intensely, because in doing that you keep your dopamine system in check and you ensure that you're gonna stay on the path of continued pursuit not just for that thing, but for all things big increases in dopamine leads to big crashes in dopamine and big increases in dopamine up the ante. They increase the extent to which you are willing to invest time and energy in order to achieve goals and rewards that may be out of your reach. You never really know if you're going to succeed. So to make this crystal clear, celebrate your wins but don't celebrate every win. That's one way that you can ensure that you're going to continue down the path of progress. And I think most of the learning tools that are in schools are about reward for genuine performance. They are about encouraging us. We do have to believe that we can perform well. One of the hallmarks of growth mindset is the internalization that we're not getting it right yet. The word yet is very important. And also the sense that we reward our good behavior, our good performance, but not every time. One way to do this is to actually take the reward and reinforcement out of your own hands and your own mind. And you tell somebody that they are in control of whether or not you're allowed to feel good about your wins. Now, I realize it's very unnatural for most people but if you're somebody who simply going to be in pursuit and you're going to really register your wins, and you think that that's gonna actually make you a better performer it will in the short term, but not in the longterm. So you can lift the what Las Vegas and Atlantic city and other gambling mechanisms and places have known for a long time. They lifted it from the scientists. You can now take it back and you can start to leverage that. And you just make it intermittent. You reward yourself, not on a predictable schedule so not every other time or every third time or every 10th time, but sometimes it's three in a row then not at all for 10 days. So reward is important. Self reward is critically important but make sure that you're not doing it on such a predictable schedule that you burn out these dopamine circuits or that you undercut your own ability to strive and achieve."}

and emotional stance uh not technical uh not a technical term but I'll use it of say being um curious like to me curiosity is an interest in the outcome with no specific emotional attachment to the outcome but of course we could say you're curious with the hope of getting a certain result you know so one could modify it but there is something about that uh childlike mind so-called beginner's mind where you're open to different outcomes and it seems like the examples that you're giving keep bringing me back to these developmental themes because if it's true that CICS you know exclude a lot of data that could be useful to them um it seems that the opportunities for neuroplasticity are reduced for cynic um to flip it on its head um to what extent are we all a little bit cynical and how would we explore that like if if I were in your laboratory and you had 10 minutes with me and you what questions would you ask me um to determine how cynical I might be or how um not cynical I might be well the first thing that I would do is give you that classic questionnaire from cook and Med which would just ask you about your theories of the world what do you think people are like do you think that people are generally honest do you think that they are generally trustworthy so it loads the questions or it's open-ended where I would would you say what what are people like and then I would um just kind of free associate about it's a series of 50 statements and you're asked in a binary way do you agree or disagree with each of these statements since then olus aova and others have adapted cook medley and made it a shorter scale and turned the questions into Contin 1 to n or 1 to S uh answers um but generally speaking these are discret questions that numerically or quantitatively tap our general theories of people if you were in my lab I might also ask you to play some different economic games you know the trust game being the number one that we might use here so I can explain it um so the trust game involves two players uh and one of them is an investor they start out with some amount of money let's just say $10 they can send as much of that money as they want to a trustee the money is then tripled in value so if the investor sends $10 it the in the hands of the trustee it becomes $30 the trustee can then choose to give back whatever amount they want to the investor so they can be exactly fair and give 15 back in which case both people end up pretty much better off than they would have without an act of trust the trustee can keep all $30 themselves betraying the investor or the trustee can give more than 50% back they can say well I started out with nothing why did you take two-thirds back and this is one terrific behavioral measure of trust and it can be played in a couple of different ways one is binary where I would say Andrew do you you can send $10 to an internet stranger or you can send nothing and they can choose to send you back half or they can choose to send you back nothing would you do it I I actually I'm curious would would you do that oh I absolutely zip it over to them yeah yeah I'm curious great you know and and I'm willing to lose the money um so I suppose that factors in as well yeah follow-up question in that type of study what percentage of Trustees do you think make the trustworthy decision of sending back the money gosh 55% yeah so your prediction there is quite aligned with most people's uh um there's a great study by fetchenhauer and and and Dunning uh that found that uh people when they're asked to forecast they say I bet 52 55% of people will send this money back will make this binary trust decision uh in fact 80% of Trustees make the pro-social and trustworthy decision uh and again what fetchenhauer and Dunning found is that when we when we have negative assumptions we're less likely to send over the money and therefore less likely to learn that we were wrong right uh and so that's one of it's another example of where cynical beliefs I mean you you're interesting because you had the belief that's a 50% chance but you still chose to trust right so From abasan perspective when that person actually sent the money back which they would have an 80% chance of doing and if if I were to ask you again what percentage of people give back you might update your perception absolutely right uh but without any evidence you can't update your perception so and this is just one of many examples it turns out that there's a lot of evidence that when asked to estimate how friendly trustworthy uh compassionate or open-minded others are people's estimates come in much lower than data suggest and this to me is both the tragedy of cynical thinking those heuristics that we're using and a major opportunity for so many of us right it's a tragedy because we're coming up with these simple uh black and white physics likee predictions about the world and they're often wrong they're often unduly negative an opportunity because to the extent that we can tap into a more scientific or curious mindset to the extent that we can open ourselves to the data pleasant surprises are are everywhere the social world is full of a lot more positive and helpful and kind people than we realize right the the average person underestimates the average person this is not to say that there aren't awful PE you know people who do awful things every day around the world there of course are but we take those extreme examples and over rotate on them we assume that the most toxic awful examples that we see are representative when they're not so we miss all these opportunities but understanding that I hope opens people to uh to to gaining more of those opportunities

{"question": "What types of background noise or sounds have been shown to enhance cognitive performance and focus in the workplace?", "doc_id": "Ze2pc6NwsHQ_13", "video_id": "Ze2pc6NwsHQ", "video_title": "Optimizing Workspace for Productivity, Focus, & Creativity", "video_header": "Leveraging Background Noise", "segment_idx": "13", "time_start": "55:55", "time_end": "1:02:19", "context": "or the music in the room or the music or noise in the headphones, because it turns out that there is a lot of quality scientific data out there that speaks to whether or not listening to particular sounds can enhance our cognition. And indeed the answer is yes, but there are very particular types of things to listen to under very particular types of conditions that allow one to do that. First off, I want to say that people vary tremendously in the extent to which they can tolerate background noise for work. In fact, individuals will vary tremendously from one day to the next, or even within the same day in the extent to which they can tolerate background noise. I've experienced this myself, there been times in which I've been working at home and I felt like for whatever reason, I just could not engage in focus. And what worked to generate more focus for me was to go to a cafe or to a library or someplace where there's actually more commotion, more people moving about, maybe even more noise, maybe even music in the room. And we have to all be in touch with when we want more background noise, or when we want less background noise, there is no hard and fast rule. If you look across the literature for studies that involve complete silence or white noise or binaural beats, or music or classical music or rock and roll, you can find results to support any type of environment as being more beneficial. However, as we'll talk about in a moment, there are a few types of environments to really avoid and a few types of sounds that really can enhance the cognition and your ability to focus in your workspace environment across the board, that really seemed to work for all people. Let's talk about background noise to avoid. And here we're talking about background noise to avoid because it actually can cause some pretty severe deficits in cognition. There's a paper first author, Jordan Love, cool name, last author Alexander Francis. The, the title of the paper has to do with \"Psychophysiological responses to potentially annoying \"heating, ventilation and air conditioning noise \"during mentally demanding work,\" which is a mouthful. But basically what this paper identifies is a large dataset in which workplace and environmental noise, mostly the humming of air conditioners that's very loud or the humming of heaters, that's very loud and ongoing, just incessant doesn't let up, can really increase mental fatigue and can vastly decrease cognitive performance. And if you're interested in looking at the cognitive performance data that authors are Banbury & Berry 2005, that paper is the one that supports the fact that cognitive performance is worse when there's just the hum of an air conditioner in the background or the hum of a heater and otherwise complete silence. There's also evidence which I discussed on the episode about hearing, which is that in young children, white noise can cause some impairments in the development of the auditory system. Now I don't want parents to freak out and if you're exposed to white noise, as it as a sleep aid as a child, which I know many of you were, don't freak out, but it turns out that white noise, especially if it's loud, white noise can cause some disruption in the auditory maps, the representation of different frequencies of sound in the brain that can lead to some deficits in auditory and even language processing. So we really have to be careful about long-term exposure, extended exposure to white noise, or kind of an air conditioning noise that's really at a high level. I wouldn't worry if it's in the background and shutting off and turning on again, as the thermostat kicks off and on, but really try and avoid work in loud fan filled or ventilation generating or heat generating environments, because it really can cause damage to the auditory system long-term and as we described, it can impair cognitive performance and overall increase fatigue. I think we've all experienced that when you're in a room and there's some ongoing background noise and all of a sudden it stops and you just feel this enormous relief [sighs]. And the reason for this is that our auditory system has a parallel to our visual system. In our visual system, that light entering the eyes triggers the activation of those melanopsin cells, which triggers activation of the hypothalamus, a particular area of the hypothalamus, which generates alertness, generates the release, even of cortisol, a stress hormone. In the auditory system, when there's ongoing sound, your auditory system hears that, even if you're not paying attention to it, if you're paying attention to something else, it's still registers. Those little hair cells, as they're called in your inner ear are fluttering, the eardrum is beating and in concert to that sound frequency. And there's a brainstem mechanism that generates alertness and a kind of vigilant. So when you have a sound that's ongoing in the background, it shuts off, all of a sudden you experienced that peace, which is the turning off of those brainstem circuits that are associated with vigilance, the locus coeruleus, which we talked about earlier, which release epinephrin and norepinephrine and generate the heightened state of alertness in your brain and body, those neurons then can turn off and you experience that as relaxation. So does that mean that we shouldn't listen to white noise or pink noise or brown noise while we're working? Certainly a lot of people do. In fact, if you want to know what white noise, pink noise and brown noise are, they're just different constellations of auditory frequencies that are played together. Most of us think of white noise as the on a screen, all the black and white pixels going all around, like they call it visual snow, but pink noise has certain sound frequencies, notched out, taken out, brown noise has others. It has different frequencies that are included at higher amplitude, et cetera. You can look this stuff up on YouTube, if you want, you to just put brown noise. None of it sounds terrific, it doesn't sound like music. It's literally just noise, mixed frequencies in no particular arrangement. There is some evidence that playing white noise in the background or on headphones or pink noise or brown noise can facilitate cognition, but it's mainly through an increase in this overall alertness as a consequence of areas like locus coeruleus and other brainstem areas that are associated with autonomic arousal from that noise. So it's a lot like the air conditioner effect. And I think done in a restricted way, meaning not for hours and hours, but maybe if your focus is waning and you're having a hard time engaging in work, you might put on some brown noise or white noise or pink noise and work that way for 45 minutes or so before you go to your panoramic vision walk and get some sunlight, that should be fine. There's really no reason to suspect, however, that those particular patterns of noise are going to optimize particular mental functions. So what I'd like to turn to next are particular patterns of sounds that indeed have been shown"}

And where I'm really going with this is, why would those component parts, eventually, allow for this dissolution of the fist or the realization that there is no distinction between actor and observer and so on. SAM HARRIS: Yeah. Yeah. Well, so to answer the second question first, ultimately, meditation is not a practice that you're adding to your life. It's not a doing more of anything. It's actually ceasing to do something. It's ultimately non-distraction. I mean, ultimately, you're recognizing what consciousness is like when you're no longer distracted by the automatic arising of thought. It's not the thoughts don't arise, it's not that you can't use them, it's not that you become irrational or unintelligent, I mean, all of that-- you still have all of your tools, but everything is in plain view. I mean, there's an analogy in Tibetan Buddhism which I love, which is you're kind of in the final stage of meditation, thoughts are like thieves entering an empty house. There's nothing for them to steal. So in the usual case, thoughts are-- there really is something in jeopardy. Every time a thought comes, I'm not meditating anymore, and not only that, I feel terrible because of what I'm thinking about most of the time. And so it's totally understandable that thoughts seem like a problem in the beginning. And for certain types of meditation, they are explicitly thought of as a problem because you're trying to focus on one thing to the exclusion of everything else, including thought. And that is what I called the concentration practice earlier. And that's a training that can be good to do. It becomes a tool that you can use for other kinds of insight. But it's a very specific and it's kind of brittle skill in the end. I mean, it's a skill. Just like I'm going to pay attention to one thing and I'm going to do that so well that everything else is going to fade out. And it's somewhat analogous to what you described in the visual system. If have a laser focus to one fixation point, everything else in your visual field begins to fade out. But meditatively, if you have a laser focus on any one thing, whether it's the breath or a candle flame or whatever it is, not only does-- I mean, let's use the breath for a second. Because your eyes can be closed. I mean, you can lose all sense of everything. I mean, you can lose all sense of hearing and your physical body can disappear. I mean, like, literally, it can become incredibly subtle and vast and drug-like. And many people approach meditation thinking climbing the ladder of those changes into subtlety and vastness, that's the whole game. And it can be a deeply rewarding game to play. And it also does come with all kinds of ancillary benefits. I mean, all the focus and the calm and the smoothness of emotional states. I mean, all of that comes with greater concentration. And it can be quite wonderful. But again, at best, that's a tool to aim in the direction that I'm talking about now with respect to meditation, which relates to more what I would call mindfulness generically. And ultimately, non-dual mindfulness. So mindfulness generically and for most people, certainly in the beginning,"}

How do I know that? Well, they're right because when you reach out to grab a glass, most of the time you grab the glass, and you don't miss, right? Most of the time, when you make judgments about the world around you, based on your visual impression of them, it allows you to move functionally through the world. But let me give you some examples of where this guessing is happening right now. And it's so incredible that, to this day, this still blows my mind. Cover one eye with one hand. If you're driving, maybe don't do this. If you're viewing the world around you, presumably you can see everything that's out there. I could do this with one eye or the other eye. You probably see better out of one or the other, and we'll talk about that. You have a giant blind spot in the middle of your visual field. It's called your blind spot. It is the spot in which the connections, the wires, from all those retinal ganglion cells exit the back of the eye and head off toward the brain. In other words, you are blind for a huge spot of your central vision. The part of your vision that's highest acuity, highest detail, and yet, you don't see that ever. You cover one eye, and you see perfectly fine. And it's not just because your eye is moving around really quickly. Your brain is guessing what's in that spot, which is absolutely incredible, and so, you don't see that blind spot. This is happening all the time. Now, when you have two eyes open, the way that your eyes are positioned in your head and the way they view the world is such that they fill in each other's blind spots, so it's pretty convenient. But if you cover one eye, that's impossible, and yet, you still see the world as complete. So the brain is doing these incredible things. It's also creating depth, a sense of depth."}
{"question": "What are the potential risks and limitations of consuming high doses of CBD, and why are most CBD products available in the market likely to be ineffective due to their poor bioavailability?", "doc_id": "jouFvyRZntk_26", "video_id": "jouFvyRZntk", "video_title": "Dr. Matthew Hill: How Cannabis Impacts Health & the Potential Risks", "video_header": "Entourage Effect; Placebo Effect, CBD & Doses", "segment_idx": "26", "time_start": "3:07:22", "time_end": "3:19:11", "context": "very specific ones that CBD hits and so as a consequence one of them is what choose THC up so you can get a potentiation of THC by inhibiting its metabolism if you have high enough CBD on board given the effects on adenosine that you described before that it's sort of the what we're calling just for sake of discussion the anti- caffeine how do we explain the preponderance of CBD added to energy drinks that also contain caffeine there's like no logic there bias there you go everything everything can't be expected I have a feeling it's going to be interesting to see in the comment section on YouTube I mean presumably there's some um Regular pot smokers uh listening to this and you know the expectancy bias is so strong as I alluded to in the placebo episode and we've been talking about here um and yet it's so strong that I think people will also be convinced that there are real differences between different strains because they've maybe done the you know non-formal blind uh you know someone someone gave them their weed and someone else and then they got a completely different effect right they're not expecting something um different necessarily um or in a particular direction but they get a very different effect but that to me just speaks to the idea that again cannabis sounds like polypharmacology 70 different cannaboids THC being among the more powerful components but it's um it's yolked in the sense that as you said people self-regulate their intake provided they're smoking not ingesting it by edible and so it's almost like T is being held constant and then there's this constellation of other things around it that are modified and people eventually Veer towards what they like what they can afford what works with their lifestyle and then they come up with a bunch of theories based on packaging what they're told but presumably also some real effects of these Turpin the CBD component Etc it can't all be just psychological expectation I mean so what you're saying is like what we said is the Entourage effect and I think that is a theory that is held by a lot of people that this exists I mean the reality is these tpes and minor canab exist at such low levels that like there's a couple of kinds of cannabis that might have like a high enough level where you're seeing something but yeah I mean I agree to the extent that it would be a little wild if everyone's subjective experience across different kinds of cannabis was entirely driven by some kind of expectancy which I can't imagine is accounting for all of it but I think when we talk about sativa versus indica I think there's a huge bias that's going into there um but one of the things with CBD that's interesting unlike THC is you can actually do pretty clean blinded studies because it's really hard to give someone THC and them not know they're on THC right this was the big problem with the MDMA trial that happened recently is that people who got the placebo knew they got Placebo people got the drug knew they got the drug it's very hard you could do a dose response but it's very diff it's very challenging to give someone a psychoactive drug and a placebo and them not know which one they have whereas because CBD doesn't produce an intoxicating state it's not really perceptible from the person who's taken it um that it's doing anything that actually does make it far more amenable to do blinded trials with and so I mean the interesting thing with CBD and this is where I get a lot of people that get angry at me as well is that I would argue that the overwhelming majority of the effects of CBD that people report are all Placebo effects and I say that because people Leverage The epilepsy stuff and some of the clinical work and say but we know it does things and my response to them is do you know what dose those people are getting because this is something that for some reason has not made the transition from science into pop culture this is a similar Phenomenon with glp1 um I and other people have pointed to the fact that certain food products or certain um drinks or certain activities can increase gp1 Glon like pepti which is now becoming more um commonplace knowledge uh because of OIC monjaro Etc as um very powerful weight loss tool although there's questions about muscle loss Etc and then we had Dr Zachary Knight on who explained that even a four-fold increase in glp1 brought about through a prescription drug or ingestion of a particular food or drink does not lead to any appreciable weight loss however when one achieves thousandfold increases in glp1 through the use of things like OIC monjaro you see profound weight loss meaning that you need enormous effects in order to see the the clinically relevant changes in in that case weight loss so it sounds like a similar thing with with CBD so so if somebody um takes a CBD gummy and they feel that they sleep better you would argue that that's entirely expectation bias I think that's a placebo effect and I say that because the majority of gummies are what like two migs five migs 20 migs maybe I I've never taken a CBD product I know a few years ago they were all the rage I just I was never tempted to do it um and I'm aware and we'll talk about this a little bit more that there is evidence according to Matt Walker who did a six episode series with on sleep that THC does help certain people fall asleep but it can dramatically alter the architecture of sleep in ways that are probably not great yeah yeah I mean THC and sleep is definitely a whole other thing um but sure a lot of people report this with CBD but again so most CBD Edibles or things that people take that are sold through commercial markets are in the range of two to 25 Megs of CBD so then I say to them so you're aware that in the pediatric epilepsy studies the dose ranges are like 1,500 to 2,000 M and then you're talking about a child who weighs on the order of what 20 kilos maybe you know like 40 60 pounds somewhere in that range versus so if you start dosing by weight which is how most of these things are done well they'll say 20 Megs per kig or whatnot um so so someone my size so I weigh a bit over 200 pounds for me to take that dose of CBD uh and let's say 20 migs per kig at like 90 odd kilos I mean you're talking about me taking a liver damaging dose an insane or maybe I wouldn't say damaging um it's definitely influencing how the liver metabolizes other things because it's going to saturate those enzymes but you're taking a very high dose so if for instance you were to take a high dose of CBD and then maybe uh have a couple alcohol containing drinks that could be problematic right because now you're talking about the two- hit model yeah I I can't speak to that because I actually do not know the metabolism of alcohol well enough I don't believe so cuz that's alcohol dehydrogenase so that would probably be a separate enzyme pathway than the sips this is more like separate enzyme pathway but you're but you're um challenging the liver yeah but I don't know if it would have an effect in that capacity I mean they've definitely seen this like they know the list of medications that this is a problem for so it's things like warin um and like blood thinners uh in the anti-epileptics funnel into the same metabolic pathway as this THC so there's certain things that this would influence I don't know if I would say this would be in the context of alcohol but I think more so I mean what I try and point out to people repeatedly is I have yet to see a blinded clinical study that has found any effect of CBD that's efficacious that's under 300 to 500 milligrams and yet in in the wild and people who are using it on their own we using doses of 10 to 20 milligrams and Reporting these effects and the thing is that I think a lot of people don't also realize is CBD has absolutely horrific bioavailability like so if you take it orally in a in an oil or in a gummy or whatever you consume it in now this might be different with some of these beverages that are out there I don't know if anyone's actually ever done the pharmacokinetics on them at least I've never seen it um but standard Roots we're talking 4% like very very little actually leaves your gut into your bloodstream now we do know from the studies from GW who created the pharmaceutical version of CBD that was used for a lot of the Pediatric epilepsy studies that they did I don't know if it was random or intentional find that opposite to something like alcohol if you had just eaten a fatty meal that actually enhanced the bioavailability of CBD dramatically so then it went up to like maybe 20% got into the blood but that's probably because again CBD is a fatty molecule it likes fatty environments and for some reason having fat in the stomach and in the gut seems to promote its ability to get into the bloodstream you can see it now it's the steak in CBD or the the CBD with omelette uh protocol I'm just kidding folks I'm not I'm not suggesting that protocol but yeah it I mean and so because of this it's like you're taking very low doses of CBD that have very poor bioavailability and then people really stand by the effects of these and so I'm like you know what I would always say is if it works for you there's no reason to stop it but because you're having benefit from it but would I ever recommend someone to do this no I wouldn't because I I can't say that I think that this has any biological activity because even when we start looking at these potential targets of what CBD could could interact with there's a couple receptors people have said you know it might interact with a serotonin receptor there's some of these like random orphan receptors that we don't know a lot of what they do that CBD might interact with but like the concentrations you need to hit those are reasonable and you're not getting that in the blood and certainly not in the brain of people from consuming incredibly low doses of CBD so the whole Market that exists for CBD to me is is a little bizarre and I think for a lot of us in the Cannabis field this has been one of the most bizarre social experiments we've ever watched because like you know if you asked me in 2010 to walk into a room and ask how many people knew what CBD is like maybe one out of a hundred like no one knew what CBD was and now it's like 80 to 90% would know what it is because everyone you can't walk down a street in any city in North America and not see CBD products whether it's some kind of cream or like a shake or some random like concoction that people have added CBD because now it's going to you're saying the energy drinks like it's just it's bizarre to me how much has taken off because it seems to have somehow migrated into being a health product in some capacity so yeah I've never tried any of these CBD containing products I think uh a lot of what you're describing speaks to the fact that um you know people are eager for things that can help them adjust their anxiety and sleep better you know which is a large um reason why a lot of this podcast has focused on respiration based tools and other based tools that um can help people with anxiety I think that many people suffer from um just too much uh activation in their autonomic nervous system and um I I would argue there are much better things that are not of a ingestible type you know things that one can do that are science supported right there are clinical studies um meditation breath work any not so much breath work I would argue but um certain patterns of breathing meditation cognitive behavioral therapy there are a whole bunch of different things as you know um so I don't know what explains the CBD craze but you certainly have shed light on what is and mainly what is not known about CBD and I think it's really important for people to hear yeah it I I mean again it's I think from my point of view it's an ethical thing as well because like this isn't covered by insurance people are spending their own money on this and so I find it really challenging to recommend someone to be spending what can I mean if you're especially if you're talking about an actual clinical dose I mean for someone to take CBD at the level where it could actually be shown to have some benefit in some condition of which currently it really is just Pediatric Epsy like this idea with sleep pain anxiety there's not a lot of super conclusive data and I'd say most of the trials that have been done have not found really good evidence of benefit in any capacity so it makes it very challenging to recommend this in any capacity especially I mean if someone if finances aren't an issue sure go for it but um you know I understand people are like you say looking for Solutions so ites doesn't sound like CBD is the solution I I would I I am not convinced by the data that exists that it's really"}
{"question": "Do certain professions, such as poetry or art, have a higher incidence of bipolar depression or mania compared to other careers?", "doc_id": "m_OazsImOiI_22", "video_id": "m_OazsImOiI", "video_title": "The Science & Treatment of Bipolar Disorder | Huberman Lab Podcast #82", "video_header": "Mania, Creativity & Occupations", "segment_idx": "22", "time_start": "2:06:46", "time_end": "2:15:29", "context": "about bipolar disorder, I want to talk a little bit about this word, disorder, and this is a theme that doesn't just relate to bipolar disorder, but other psychiatric disorders as well. And when we think of a disorder, we think of something that is really detrimental to us. Something that really impairs our ability to function in work, in school, in relationships, and really starts to pull down our health status in a variety of ways. And certainly bipolar disorder meets those criteria. However, there is this idea that things like bipolar disorder, even things like schizophrenia in some cases are responsible for some of the creative aspects or the creative works that have been observed and carried out by human beings for many centuries. And believe it or not, there are good data to support the fact that certain aspects of mania are associated with creativity. Now, we are long overdue for an episode about creativity, its neural circuit basis, its chemical basis here on the Huberman Lab Podcast, and certainly we will have that conversation. But in the meantime, I'd like to just briefly touch upon this idea that certain occupations are associated with a higher incidence of bipolar depression. And in fact, it's been explored at a research level. There are data pointed to the fact that certain individuals of certain occupations tend to be more creative and that creativity is associated with, again, associated, this isn't causal, it's associated, correlated with higher levels or incidents of bipolar depression and maybe even other forms of depression. So this is a study looking at mood disorders in eminent individuals. So these are people that are not just good at what they do, but are exceptional at what they do, and explored the percentage of people in given professions with either depression or mania. And this was actually a data set gleaned from more than a thousand 20th Century Westerners based on their biographies that were reviewed by other people. So it's a bit of an indirect measurement. This isn't psychiatrist data, this is data, or I should say these are data that were compiled from self reports or from reads of self reports. And they explored a number of different professions. So for instance, they looked at people in the military or people who were professional athletes or natural scientists or social scientists, people who occupied positions in public office, or were musical performers, artists, nonfiction writers, poetry, et cetera. There are a lot of professions here. I will post this or I'll post a link to it in the show note captions for you to peruse, but I'll just give you a sense of the extremes on this graph because they're very interesting. Turns out that if you were to look at the profession or I should say among the professions they looked at in this study, 'cause they didn't look at all professions, those in the military and those who are professional athletes or had jobs in the social or natural sciences, of those, there was a lower percentage of those that had depression or mania. In some cases like those who were professional athletes didn't seem to have, there was no incidence of mania, at least in this dataset, whereas at the opposite extreme of the graph, those that were poets, so these are eminent individuals, people that were exceptional poets, exceptional fiction writers, exceptional artists or non-fiction writers, well there, especially for the poets, you find that as many as 90% of these very successful poets had either depression or mania. As high as 90%, that's incredible. Contrast that with military where it's as few as 10% or professional athletes where it's as few as 20%, and for the professional athletes, as I mentioned before, none of them had mania. So does this mean that being a poet will make you manic or depressed? Well, first of all, let's look at the poetry category. It turns out that 75% of these eminent poets, these highly accomplished poets had major depression, whereas only about 20% of those poets had manic episodes. So again, it's not that being a poet is going to give you mania, certainly we're not saying that, it's not that being a poet is going to give you depression, but it turns out that people with depression and people with depression and mania seem to gravitate towards poetry or at least are very successful at poetry. Again, associative, correlative, no causal relationship here. But it is really striking to see how the creative occupations, poetry, fiction, art, non-fiction writing, even though non-fiction writing is about non-fiction, it's still creative, music composition, theater, much higher incidents of things like mania. In fact, for the people in theater, the actors, even though the overall occurrence of depression and mania is lower than that in poets, the fraction of those individuals that have mania is exceedingly high. It's about 30% of those that they looked at who are actors, have manic episodes or have full blown mania. So I'm referring to these data because first of all, I find them incredibly interesting, right up until now we've been talking about bipolar disorder and other mood disorders for their maladaptive effects. And again, they're extremely maladaptive, much, much higher instance of suicide, et cetera, but we'd be wrong to say that certain aspects of manic episodes don't lend themselves well to creativity or that certain aspects of major depression don't lend themselves well to creativity or to the performing arts or to poetry. That said, in no way, shape or form, do I believe that being depressed is a good thing or that being manic is a good thing. Again, we return to the basic foundational criteria for bipolar disorder, major depression which is that the pressured speech, the not sleeping, the incredible increases in energy and the flights of ideas are generally not going to lead, or I think it's fair to say, are not going to lead to good places. In fact, often lead to bad places. But we would also be wrong if we didn't consider the fact that there is a somewhat inextricable relationship between mania and creativity. And it could be that hypomania or brief periods of mania, maybe even an hour a day or 30 minutes a day of composing or writing poetry, maybe even some of the lows that we feel, some of the sadness, some of the grief, some of the nostalgia that we feel provided that it's not pathologic, that it's not persistent for the four or seven days that are diagnostic of bipolar 2 and bipolar 1 disorder respectively, well, then we can start to view emotional states as something that can actually lend themselves to positive outcomes and maybe even to creativity and to improved occupations. So it's important that we have a nuanced view of what sadness versus depression versus major depression are, it's important that we distinguish between being erratic, being very energized, and full blown bipolar disorder. And I raise this for another reason as well. Nowadays, it's very common to hear people saying, ah, you know, that person is OCD. Well, on the episode about OCD that I did a few weeks back, that you can find if you like at hubermanlab.com, in that episode, I pointed out that OCD, obsessive-compulsive disorder is very maladaptive. I think it's number seven, as I recall on the list of debilitating diseases, all diseases in terms of lost time at work, suffering relationships, et cetera. So it's a really serious condition. And yet we often hear, oh, that person is obsessive. And as I pointed out, there is obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. And then there is obsessive-compulsive tendencies, which actually benefit people, but that is distinct from obsessive-compulsive disorder as a clinically diagnosed thing. Similarly, we hear that, oh, somebody's being bipolar. You know, they're all over the place. They're bipolar. Well, that's a very subjective label that people give one another in passing, more and more often I'm hearing this, and yet bipolar disorder, whether or not it's BP-1 or BP-2 are extremely maladaptive and extremely associated with high suicide risk. So while I'm not here to police people, I'm not certainly not the word police or the nomenclature police, I do think that whether or not you refer to people as OCD or as bipolar, et cetera, that's up to you, it's not my place to say, but I do think it's important that all of us understand that these psychiatric conditions carry with them tremendous maladaptive weight. So today we've really done a deep dive"}
{"question": "Do artificial sweeteners, such as saccharin or sucralose, affect the gut microbiome in humans in the same way as they do in animal models, particularly mice?", "doc_id": "15R2pMqU2ok_19", "video_id": "15R2pMqU2ok", "video_title": "How to Enhance Your Gut Microbiome for Brain & Overall Health", "video_header": "Artificial & Non-Caloric Sweeteners", "segment_idx": "19", "time_start": "1:41:02", "time_end": "1:44:23", "context": "and the gut microbiome. I want to be very clear that what I'm about to tell you has only been established in animal models, in a mouse model, at least to my knowledge. What the studies have shown, and there were several, but one published in the journal \"Nature\" a few years back is the one that got the most amount of attention is that animals that consume large amounts of artificial sweeteners. in particular things like saccharin or sucralose show disruptions in their gut microbiome. I'm not aware of any studies in humans that show the equivalent effect. And I'm not aware of any studies in humans that show the equivalent effect for things like plant-based, low-calorie sweeteners, things like Stevia, monk fruit, and things of that sort. And at least by my exploration, I couldn't find any data specifically related to the sweetener aspartame. So right now it's somewhat controversial and actually this is kind of a third rail topic out there. When one group will come out saying that artificial sweeteners are bad because they disrupt the gut microbiome, the response generally from a number of people as well, that's only been shown in animal models. And indeed that's true. So right now I don't think that there's a strong case one way or the other. I think that people should basically ask themselves whether or not they like artificial sweeteners or not, whether or not they're willing to risk it or not, and obviously that's an individual choice. I also want to point out a recent study from Diego Bohorquez's lab, which actually shows, however, that neurons in the gut, those neuropod cells, are actually capable of distinguishing between real sugars and artificial sweeteners. This is a really interesting body of work. It was published just now, just recently, I should say, February 2022. The title of the paper is \"The Preference for Sugar over Sweetener Depends on a Gut Sensor Cell\". And to make a long story short, what they showed was there's a category of neuropod cells that recognize sugar in the gut and signal that information about the presence of sugar in the gut to the brain via the pathways we talked about before, the nodose ganglia, the vagus, dopamine, et cetera, et cetera. Interestingly, the very same category of neurons can respond to artificial sweeteners and signal that information to the brain, but the pattern of signaling and indeed the signature pattern that is conveyed to the brain and received by the brain is actually quite a bit different when these same neurons are responding to artificial sweeteners versus actual sugar. And this is very interesting because what it means is first of all that neurons have incredible specificity in terms of what they are signaling from the gut to the brain. And it also means that there may be a particular signal that the brain receives that says I'm receiving some intake of food or drink that tastes sweet but doesn't actually offer much nutrients in the direction of sweetness, meaning that it doesn't have calories despite being sweet. Now, again, this is all subconscious processing. And like with the previous studies we were just discussing about artificial sweeteners generally and the gut microbiome generally, it's unclear how this relates to humans at this point in time. But given the similarity of cellular processes and molecular processes at the level of gut-brain in mice, I think it stands to reason that these neuropod cells very likely are capable of signaling sweet presence of real sweetener versus artificial sweetener in humans as well, although that still remains to be determined empirically. So I'd like to just briefly recap what I've covered today."}
{"question": "What is the role of play in adults and how can it be used to enhance our personal and professional lives?", "doc_id": "BwyZIWeBpRw_3", "video_id": "BwyZIWeBpRw", "video_title": "Using Play to Rewire & Improve Your Brain", "video_header": "Homeostatic Regulation of Play", "segment_idx": "3", "time_start": "13:59", "time_end": "23:51", "context": "Now in researching this episode, I thought that I was going to come across a bunch of papers that say this brain area connects to that brain area, which controls play in animals. And there's similar areas in babies and in adults. And indeed, that's true. And we will talk about brain circuitry, but I think more importantly is to understand what is the utility of play? You know, why do we play when we're younger? Why do we tend to play less as we get older? And what in the world is play for? Some of us would be categorized as more playful. I'm sure that you know, people like this, maybe you are like this people that can walk into a room, a social setting of any kind, and they seem to already kind of have a playful, maybe even a mischievous quality about them. We'll talk about mischief a little bit later, but they sort of look at an environment or a social setting as an opportunity for different kinds of novel interactions. Other people and I'd probably put myself into this category. If I walk into a novel environment, I tend to be more in the mode of just assessing what that environment is like. I'm not a particularly spontaneously playful person, although around certain individuals, I might be more spontaneously playful. We are all on a continuum of this kind of seriousness to playful nature. Turns out that all young animals, including humans have more playfulness and tend to engage in more spontaneous play in their earlier years than in their later years. And therein lies a very interesting portal to understanding what the utility, what the purpose of play is. First of all, I want to lay down a couple of key facts about play that point to the fact that play is not just about games. Play is about much, much more and play and in particular, how we played as a child and still how we can play as adults is really how we test and expand our potential roles in all kinds of interactions. One of the most important, interesting and surprising features of play that I'd like everyone to know about is that it is homeostatically regulated. Some of you are familiar with the term homeostasis. Homeostasis is just this aspect of biological systems to try and remain in balance. You know, if you stay awake for a long period of time, you tend to want to sleep for a long period of time. If you slept for a long period of time and you're very rested, then you tend to be very energetic the next day. And of course, I know people out there will immediately say, oh, well, if I sleep too long, then I'm groggy the next day. Of course there are exceptions, but in general, sleep and wakefulness are in homeostatic balance. Thirst and water consumption are in homeostatic balance. If you don't drink any fluids for a while, you tend to get more thirsty, you drink fluids and your thirst tends to diminish likewise with food. Likewise, with most all motivated behaviors. Well, one of the most important discoveries of the last century, was largely the work of a guy named Jaak Panksepp. No, it's not Jack it's Jaak Panksepp who really pioneered this understanding of the biology of play and relating that to the psychology of play in animals and humans. He's considered kind of luminary in the field of play, and what a great title to have, right? If you could have a title and be a scientific luminary, you might as well be the, the play guy. In fact he was known and I'll get into this later as to why, but he was known as the \"Rat Tickler\" because he tickled rats. And he actually found that rodents and animals of many kind generate laughter in response to tickling. And in fact, they don't have the capacity to tickle themselves something we'll also talk about why that is. And he was called the \"Rat tickler,\" but then he discovered that many species of animals engage in laughter in response to tickling and they tickle each other. And the reason you don't hear them laughing, no you can't hear your dog laughing that isn't laughing it's something else is that most animals besides humans laugh at kind of ultrasonic levels of auditory output. Meaning the frequencies of sound are just too high for you to hear, but with the appropriate devices, he was able with his colleagues to isolate this so-called the \"Rat Laughter\" and then turns out there's kitten laughter and there's puppy laughter. And of course there's human laughter. So Jaak Panksepp was a very interesting and pioneering person in this field. And he also discovered that play is homeostatically regulated. Meaning if animals including children are restricted from playing for a certain amount of time, they will play more when given the opportunity in the same way that if I food restrict you for a long period of time, you'll eat more when you are finally allowed to eat. Now this is important because it moves this thing that we call play from the dimension of higher order functions or things evolved recently, you know, that are really kind of at the front edge of human evolution, deeper into the circuitry of the brain, whereby we say the brain stem, the kind of ancient parts of the brain are going to be involved. And in fact, that's the case as we're going to learn later in the podcast, play is generated through the connectivity of many brain areas. But one of the key brain areas is an area called PAG Periaqueductal Gray. The Periaqueductal Gray is a brain stem area. So it's pretty far back as the brain kind of transitions into the spinal cord. And it's rich with neurons that make endogenous opioids. So these are not the kinds of opioids that are causing the opioid crisis. These are neurons that you and I all have that release endogenous, meaning self-made or biologically made opioids. They go by names like enkephalin and things of that sort. Play evokes small amounts of opioid release into the system. They kind of dope you up a little bit, not so much as one would see if one were to take exogenous opioids. And in fact exogenous opioids as we now know, are potentially very hazardous, highly high addiction potential high overdose potential. They cause all sorts of problems. Yes there are clinical uses for them, but they're causing a lot of problems nowadays, but these endogenous opioids are released in children and adults anytime we engage in play. And that turns out to be a very important chemical state because there's something about having an abundance of these endogenous opioids released into the brain that allows other areas of the brain, like the prefrontal cortex, the area of the front that's responsible for what we call executive function. Executive function is the ability to make predictions, to assess contingencies. Like if I do this, then that happens. If I do that, then that happens. Well prefrontal cortex is often seen as a kind of rigid executive of the whole brain. That's one way to view it, but probably a better way to view it is that the prefrontal cortex works in concert with these other are more primitive circuitries. And when the periaqueductal gray releases these endogenous opioids during play, the prefrontal cortex, doesn't get stupid. It actually gets smarter. It develops the ability to take on different roles and explore different contingencies. And we're going to talk about role play later in different contexts. And what we will find is that so much of play is really about exploring things in a way that feels safe enough to explore, right? This is not what happens when we drive down the street or when we bike down the street, when we are headed to work, commuting on our bicycle or walking or driving, we tend to be very linear and we tend to be very goal directed. We're not going to just take a new street just because we're not going to be spontaneously riding in the middle of the road and then on the sidewalk and then back and forth. Although I can remember as a kid, I was doing some of that. I like to jump off curb cuts when I was a kid. And then eventually I graduated, sorry to the cyclist, but I graduated to skateboarding. And then I look on skateboarding. You're always kind of exploring terrain, but you know, as I got older, actually I find myself becoming much more linear. I just don't play with my commute very much. It's really just about getting to work and then working. When endogenous opioids are in our system, when we're in this mode of play, the prefrontal cortex starts seeing and exploring many more possibilities of how we interact with our environment, with others and the roles that we can assume for ourselves. And so we're going to dissect one by one, the different aspects of play, role play, social play, individual play, imaginary play, competitive play they are enormous number of dimensions of play. And by the end of this episode, we are going to arrive at a very key feature. The key feature is one that's called your personal play identity. All of us have what we call a personal play identity. This personal play identity was laid down during development. And it is the identity that you assume in playful scenarios. And it is identity that you adopt in non playful scenarios. Now the great news is that your personal play identity is plastic throughout your entire lifespan. You can adjust your personal play identity in ways that will benefit you in work in relationships and your overall level of happiness. We will discuss protocols and ways to do that. But I do want to give a nod to the late jack, Jaak excuse me, Jaak Panksepp, \"The rat tickler.\" And I also want to just give a nod to play generally, as we move forward in the discussion. What I'd love for everyone to do is to stop thinking about play as just a child activity, not just a sport related activity, but really as an exploration in contingencies. Again, it's an exploration of, if I do A, what happens? If I do B, what happens? If someone else takes on behavior or attitude C what am I going to do? And play is really where we can expand our catalog of potential outcomes, and it can be enormously enriching. And indeed as we'll talk about the tinkerers of the world, the true creatives, the people that building incredible technologies and art, and also that just have incredibly rich, emotional and intellectual and social lives all have a strong element of play. And so today I hope to convince you of some protocols that will allow you to expand your various roles in life, through the portal of play. So we establish that play is homeostatic, meaning we all need to do it."}

"context": "questions that you uh give or ask of patients in order to help them along that pathway um because I totally agree that changing beliefs and internal narratives is very very hard uh just one quick example that meshes with the physical health realm I have a a friend and colleague he's a very accomplished scien who was very overweight for a long period of time he finally made some behavioral changes that allowed him to lose I think it was in upwards of 80 pounds a significant amount of weight felt much better looked much better he just delighted in his ability to do that but then started to reveal to me that he was deathly afraid that he was going to lose control and start eating the way he was before and stop exercising in a way that would return him to his previous weight and feelings of Malay and I said well all the things you're doing are in the direction of Health none of what you're doing speaks to the possibility of this all crumbling this was the dissolve into a puddle of my own tears kind of narrative but at this point coming from him and he just said I know but despite doing all the right things I'm still incredibly afraid that it's going to happen it was as if the the beliefs and the internal narratives hadn't changed despite the fact that he was engaging in the world differently and more positively uh I haven't checked in with him recently to find out where he's at with this now several years later he has kept off most of the weight not all of it gained a little bit back but he's still far healthier than than he ever was so hopefully he's experience some relief but you know what do you tell a patient who uh is saying you know I've got this Loop in my head that tells me I'm not good enough or that even when things are going well they're going to return to that state that I fear so much once again this kind of like you know lack of agency right just lack of agency lack of agency lack of empowerment what what sorts of practical tools can can one give themselves or that you would provide to somebody no matter what is behind what's going on in that person's mind it's addressable but you don't know what it is and how to address it until we ask the question of what's going on inside right so if he's afraid that he's going to gain all that weight back right and he has a history that if significant negative things happen he throws self-care to the wind right that then we'd come at it through that pattern right because he would have a very you know he'd have a good reason to be worried right because this pattern of something bad happens and I can't I don't take care of myself for 6 months you know and maybe someone I'm just making this up and maybe someone in his life is ill or he's fearing a death you know in the future just something that would say that's a very legitimate fear to have like let's let's talk about that like let's look at where that comes from right what got that person into that pattern in the first place right by understanding the pattern and by working together right can we can we save that off right but it could be different the person might say well I'm really I'm having a lot of food cravings right and we like okay what does that mean where's that coming from or maybe he's depressed and when and he's getting depressed and when he's depressed he can't stop eating more right so you know you would look or it might just be plain old fear like this is so good right that that I'm worried it will go away right then we might want to reinforce like okay like you know you're a person who's able to use circumspection and perseverance and preserve goodness right so like you do that and you do that really well so let's let's make sure we're doing that here right so you know a lot of times a person is worried but that worry is coming through the lens of Health like they're healthy right so then we look at okay can we Soo that worry where where's that coming from right we can come at it and reinforce the positive but if there is something negative there's a trauma driven cycle there's depression there Cravings we we can understand that too so so I come back to this idea that there's answers to just about everything and in a very regimented scientific way it's not that hard to come to them right just like in Physical Medicine like we have the par we have the tools that we need to bring to bear but you have to understand the person again if you come in and say I'm not feeling good and someone else comes in and says I'm not feeling good the doctor better not do the same things right says how are you not feeling good okay let me understand that and then let let me map that also to you whatever underlying state of health you may have or diagnoses you may have the same is true in mental health if we just apply that then it's remarkable the good that we do which I've seen very consistently across 20 years of doing this not only in my own practice but like who are the people who do really really well trying to understand and take care of people including sometimes not doing too much and realizing like hey this person is okay like there's a state of health here but this person is worried how do we reassure them right how do we help someone living a good life live a better life right if we're going to do all of this we have to approach people as individuals it's just

{"question": "Are there any plant-based sources of omega-3 fatty acids that can provide similar health benefits as fish oil?", "doc_id": "XcvhERcZpWw_14", "video_id": "XcvhERcZpWw", "video_title": "Dr. Rhonda Patrick: Micronutrients for Health & Longevity | Huberman Lab Podcast #70", "video_header": "Benefits of Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Omega-3 Index & Life Expectancy", "segment_idx": "14", "time_start": "54:24", "time_end": "59:23", "context": "So kind of back to the why for fish oil. I personally think it is one of the most powerful, anti-inflammatory things, dietary lifestyle, things that we can get easily, relatively easily, that is going to powerfully modulate the way you think, the way you feel, and the way you age. And a variety of different types of studies kind of led me to that conclusion, a variety of observational studies. So there's been lots of work by Dr. Bill Harris and his collaborators looking at, it's called the Omega-3 Index. So this is actually the omega-3 level in red blood cells. So red blood cells turn over about every 120 days. So it's a long-term marker of omega-3 status. This is very different from 99.9% of any study you see or any lab that you go to to get your omega-3 levels tested. You're getting your plasma phospholipid levels tested, which is kind of like you can think of it as, what did I eat a couple days before? Oh, I had fish. My omega-3 levels are great. But did you eat fish like that every week, or was it like you went out to dinner? So it's not a great biomarker for long-term omega-3 status. It's kind of like the fasting blood glucose levels versus the HbA1c, which is like a long-term marker of your blood glucose levels. So the Omega-3 Index. He's done a variety of studies, observational studies. So, for people listening, these are studies that are obviously flawed because they're not establishing causality. You're looking at people's lifestyles. But, in the case of Bill Harris's work, he's measuring something. So he's measuring the Omega-3 Index. And he's measuring the Omega-3 Index in people, and then looking at their mortality risk, for example, or their cardiovascular disease risk. And what he has found is that, first of all, standard American diet has an Omega-3 Index of 5%. Japan, by contrast, has an Omega-3 Index of around 10 to 11%. Big difference there. And they also have about a five-year increased life expectancy compared to people in the US. - Do you think that's mainly due to their fish intake, seafood intake? - So what he showed was, I think it's a big part of it. I mean, you can't says it's the only thing, but what he showed in his data was that, and I think it was Framingham Study, where he looked at the Omega-3 Index, and people that had a Omega-3 Index of 4% or lower, so close to what the standard American is but a little bit lower, they had a five-year decreased life expectancy compared to people that had an 8% Omega-3 Index. And so big difference there, right? Five years life expectancy. But here's the really interesting thing, Andrew. He also looked at smokers, smokers and their omega-3 levels, and so he stratified it, and he found smokers that had no omega-3 were like the worst of all. I mean, it was just like worse, right? We all know smoking is bad for us and will take years off our life expectancy. - Absolutely. - But smokers that had the high level, like smokers that were taking their fish oil or eating fish or whatever it was they were doing to get them up to 8%, they had the same life expectancy as non-smokers with the low Omega-3 Index. - Wow. - Right? - Wow. That's amazing. And it's also amazing to me that people still smoke cigarettes. But I see a lot of people vaping, and I know a lot of people consume cannabis. Have there been any studies specifically of vaping or people smoking marijuana? - Life expectancy? - All-cause mortality. - I haven't seen those. I haven't seen those. - They're not motivated enough to come in as research subjects. That was, again, a poor joke. It is hard to study people, marijuana use, unless, I'm told by my colleagues that study this stuff, unless you offer people marijuana, in which case they'll do it. But, again, they're actually not very good research subjects in all seriousness 'cause they are not very motivated or consistent, and they forget their appointments. So that's incredible. And you mentioned that the data on pollution related to the plant compounds earlier. So it's almost like these things are, again, are acting in a reparative way. - The omega-3s are, I mean, they are resolving inflammation. They're blunting inflammation. They're doing so many different. They affect so many different parts of the inflammatory pathway, which is, I think, plays a huge role in the way we age, the way our brain ages, the way we feel, our mood, our joints, all that. And so it's amazing that it's not, you know. - I love fish oil. I feel better when I take it. I try to eat some fatty fish a couple times a week. I do want to just touch on food sources for a moment. First of all, are there plants that are rich in omega-3s?"}

{"question": "What is the role of the nervous system in controlling muscle movement and growth, and how can it be optimized to achieve specific muscle goals?", "doc_id": "XLr2RKoD-oY_2", "video_id": "XLr2RKoD-oY", "video_title": "Science of Muscle Growth, Increasing Strength & Muscular Recovery", "video_header": "Muscle Is A Slave To the Nervous System", "segment_idx": "2", "time_start": "12:49", "time_end": "16:17", "context": "But of course muscles are involved in everything that we do. They are involved in speaking, they're involved in sitting and standing up, they're involved in lifting objects, including ourselves. They are absolutely essential for maintaining how we breathe. They're absolutely essential for ambulation, for moving, and for skills of any kind. So when we think about muscle, we don't just want to think about muscle the meat that is muscle, but what controls that muscle. And no surprise what controls muscle is the nervous system. The nervous system does that through three main nodes of control areas of control. And I've talked about these before on a previous podcast. So I will keep this very brief. Basically, we have upper motor neurons in our motor cortex. So those are in our skull and those are involved in deliberate movement. So if I decide that I'm going to pick my pen up and put it down, which is what I'm doing right now, my upper motor neurons were involved in generating that movement. Those upper motor neurons send signals down to my spinal cord where there are two categories of neurons. One are the lower motor neurons and those lower motor neurons send little wires that we call axons out to our muscles and cause those muscles to contract. They do that by dumping chemicals onto the muscle. In fact, the chemical is acetylcholine. I've talked before about acetylcholine in the brain which is vitally important for focus and actually can gait neuroplasticity, the brain's ability to change in response to experience. But in the neuromuscular system, acetylcholine released from motor neurons is the way the only way that muscles can contract. Now, there's another category of neurons in the spinal cord called central pattern generators or CPGs. And those are involved in rhythmic movements. Anytime we're walking or doing something where we don't have to think about it to do it deliberately, it's just happening reflexively that central pattern generators and motor neurons. Anytime we're doing something deliberately, the top-down control as we call it, from the upper motor neurons comes in and takes control of that system. So it's really simple. You've only got three ingredients. You've got the upper motor neurons, the lower motor neurons and for rhythmic movements that are reflexive, you've also got the central pattern generators. So it's a terrifically simple system at that level, but what we're going to focus on today is how that system can control muscle in ways that make that system better. Now, when I say better, I want to be very specific. If your goal is to build larger muscles, there's a way to use your nervous system to trigger hypertrophy to increase the size of those muscles. And it is indeed controlled by the nervous system. So you can forget the idea that the muscles have memory or that muscles grow in response to something that's just happening within the muscle, it's the nerve to muscle connection that actually creates hypertrophy. I'll talk exactly about how to optimize that process. In addition, if you want to improve endurance or improve flexibility or suppleness or explosiveness, that is all accomplished by the way that the nervous system engages muscles specifically. And so what that means is we have to ask ourselves are we going to take control of the upper motor neurons, the central pattern generators, or the lower motor neurons or all three in order to get to some end point of how the nervous system controls muscle. So neurophysiology 101."}
{"question": "What types of exercise are beneficial for individuals with anorexia, and how can they be encouraged to adopt a more anabolic approach to exercise and nutrition?", "doc_id": "2XGREPnlI8U_22", "video_id": "2XGREPnlI8U", "video_title": "Healthy Eating & Eating Disorders - Anorexia, Bulimia, Binging", "video_header": "Anabolic vs. Catabolic Exercise, Spontaneous Movements, NEAT", "segment_idx": "22", "time_start": "1:40:40", "time_end": "1:43:22", "context": "that for instance, build muscle resistance training and allow them to eat a bit more food without necessarily losing weight, but rather to put more muscle on their body can actually be beneficial. Now I'm not talking about anorexics becoming bodybuilders, has all body dysmorphia associated with bodybuilding, but certain forms of exercise are just catabolic. Meaning they break down the amount of muscle. They reduce body weight, overall, other types of exercises like resistance training or anabolic, they allow muscle to be put on. And there are some interesting studies, not a lot, but some interesting studies trying to encourage anorexics, not to stop exercising, but rather to stop exercising in this neurotic catabolic way of breaking oneself down, but rather getting them shifted toward breaking habits of only approaching low calorie, low fat foods, while also encouraging them to embark on resistance training and to start to learn and reward the relationship between exercise for sake of making one's body strong, including the bones, not just the muscles, but the bones, which is important, especially in anorexics. And then to see food as a way to nourish that process, to building a body that could be of the stable weight. Hopefully there, once the anorexic is of a healthy weight that they're maintaining that weight, but that they don't have to constantly be on this treadmill, no pun intended of balancing whatever food intake they have with activity. And along the lines of that. During the episode on fat loss and metabolism as well, I talked about this neat and non-exercise induced thermogenesis where people who tend to be thin, tend to bounce around a lot. They're kind of fidgety and that burns 1000 of calories a day, anywhere from 800 to 2000 calories a day. Now that can be beneficial for the folks that are overweight and have a healthy mindset about food, but are trying to lose weight. And it turns out that by, you literally fidgeting and bouncing around, like, this is why I'm doing this. It looks ridiculous. You actually burn a lot of body fat and calories. That way provide you're in a caloric deficit, you'll burn body fat because body fat is not just a passive tissue. It actually receives input from neurons that release noradrenaline and adrenaline. And this neat. Has been described for several decades now. And it actually is a pretty terrific way to burn off more calories. So, with the anorexic, you actually want to encourage them to not constantly be trying to burn off calories. That can be very challenging. So, shifting them toward activities like weight bearing activities or resistance training that promote this more anabolic type of relationship to activity, as opposed to catabolic can be beneficial. Before we move on to talking about bulimia and some related disorders, I want to talk about an aspect of anorexia."}

level and if you could understand even a tiny fraction even just one bit it what I just described you're doing great if you could understand more outstanding just to make sure that everyone's on the same page as we move forward because I do want to make sure that everyone understands ketamine and how it works because it does have these sort of cryptic functions of engaging neuroplasticity in ways that aren't obvious if you just ask you know what does ketamine do when you inject it what does ketamine produce in terms of a feeling State and then you know how does somebody get relief from depression that can all start to get a little bit muddled unless you understand the following so I'm going to tell it to you again in just very top Contour terms somebody takes a pill or an injection or sublingual ketamine it makes its way into the bloodstream and then it makes its way into the brain once it's in the brain it binds to a particular category of receptors called the nmda receptor the nmda receptor is a receptor that normally is quiescent it's just kind of sitting there it doesn't tend to do a lot under normal conditions of everyday life however the nmda receptors typical function okay so when there's no ketamine in the body or brain is to to detect abnormal levels of neural activity and in doing so recruit changes to cells receptors Etc literally change the neurons in ways that allow them to respond to that activity in the future without having to be under such big metabolic demand and they do that by recruiting more receptors Etc much in the same way as when you overload a muscle in the gym it will eventually recover if you allow it to recover and it will get stronger through the addition of a bunch of new proteins the nerve communication of that muscle will change the muscle and the nerve to muscle connection change it gets stronger and sometimes it gets bigger and stronger in the same way a neuron can change the way it functions in response to experience and neurons don't know experience of life in any other way except the patterns of electrical activity and chemical activity that impinges on them okay now ketamine the drug binds to and blocks that nmda receptor so the obvious conclusion would be that ketamine prevents neuroplasticity and that's not what happens we know that ketamine actually induces neuroplasticity and it does so specifically in the brain circuits that control mood the net consequence being improvements in mood how does that happen it happens because ketamine binds to and blocks those nmda receptors on inhibitory neurons the inhibitory neurons are the neurons that normally suppress the activity of other neurons so when ketamine binds to the nmda receptor the activity of those inhibitory neurons is reduced and as a consequence excitatory communication between neurons in those mood-related circuits increases and it increases it in a way that recruits neuroplasticity that strengthens those connections and makes them more likely to be active in the future now it is not the case at least at clinical doses the ketamine induces seizures it certainly can at higher doses but at clinical doses when ketamine suppresses the activity of those inhibitory neurons and the excitatory neurons ramp up their activity they're ramping up their activity a lot and enough to create changes in those neural circuits associated with mood and the changes are in the direction of making those neural circuits more likely to generate positive mood and less likely to generate negative mood we'll get into the specifics of those circuits in a little bit but ketamine is not creating the kind of enormous increases in excitatory communication between neurons that leads to that runaway excitation now the point of the discussion we just had over the last 10 minutes or so was several fold first of all I do believe it's important to understand the key components of neuroplasticity which is this remarkable feature of our brain and nervous system that we all have right this ability to change our own brain circuits no other organ in the body as far as we know can direct its own changes but we can direct our own brain changes and the nmda receptor is absolutely critical for that I also think it's important to understand the difference between inhibitory and excitatory communication between neurons because that's just Central to understanding brain function brain function is a series of accelerators and breaks it's not all about neurons stimulating other neurons it's also about neurons preventing the activation of other neurons that's just Central to everything not just preventing seizures but it's Central to learning it's Central to vision is Central to hearing it's Central to creativity it is at the core of brain function and the other reason to have the discussion we just did is that ketamine has this incredible property it can literally change the neural circuits that generate mood that generate your feelings of well-being but it does so through a somewhat convoluted pathway right it blocks the receptor that everyone thinks is involved in neuroplasticity and in doing so it actually creates neuroplasticity now even though I just described all of that to you over the last 10 minutes or so keep in mind that what I just described to you as a process that actually occurs in the brain takes many many days it involves cells changing gene expression making new proteins new receptors anytime we say neuroplasticity even when you read about so-called short-term neuroplasticity it is happening over the course of at least many many hours and more likely many days or even weeks so the process I just described of how ketamine creates neuroplasticity through blockade of nmda receptors is very likely to be the process that explains the longer term changes in mood and affect that are associated with ketamine therapy for the treatment of depression now it is possible that ketamine blocking the nmda receptor is also responsible for some of the immediate effects of ketamine that people experience when they take the drug the dissociation the in some cases euphoria and that sort of dreamlike state that it can put people into that is possible but it's very clear that the nmda receptor blockade is critical for the neuroplastic changes that are going to occur over the days and weeks following ketamine treatment and if you think back to our earlier discussion when we were talking about the two time a week over three week type regimen of taking ketamine or some variant on that now it might start to make sense as to why yes there is immediate and short-term benefit of taking ketamine for depression in the clinically appropriate setting of course I'm not talking about recreational use right now but that also there's some durability of those effects that even after the three weeks of taking ketamine twice per week people often will experience weeks or months of relief from depression when they're not doing the weekly ketamine therapy sessions so that longer term relief that I'm referring to as durability of the treatment is very likely to be the consequence of actual neural circuit reward wiring now there's an additional and very important facet to this whole"}
{"question": "What dosage of NMN should I take daily to increase my NAD levels and potentially slow down aging, and are there any specific forms or brands that are better than others?", "doc_id": "n9IxomBusuw_15", "video_id": "n9IxomBusuw", "video_title": "Dr. David Sinclair: The Biology of Slowing & Reversing Aging", "video_header": "Resveratrol, NAD, NMN, NR; Dosage, Timing", "segment_idx": "15", "time_start": "56:45", "time_end": "1:09:03", "context": "along the lines of supplementation. What about NMN, NR and B3, niacin? How does one, I want to know what you do. I also want to know what I should do, and I think most people want to know what they should do. These are molecules that impact the sirtuin pathway impact the pathways that control aging or rates of aging in the epigenome. How do they do that? And how does one incorporate that into a supplementation protocol? Should they choose to do that? All right. - Well, disclaimer is I don't recommend anything, but I talk about what I do. So a bit of scientific background, these are two in genes that we discovered first in yeast cells when I was at MIT and then in animals as I moved to Harvard in the 2000's one of my first post-docs, actually literally my first postdoc Haim Cohen, published a great paper just a couple of months ago and found that turning on the sirtuin six gene, middle of the seven, number six gene is very potent. It extended the lifespan dramatically of mice that he engineered both males and females, which is great. So what you want to do is so naturally boost the activity of these sirtuins. They are genes, but they also make proteins. That's what genes typically make or encode. And then those proteins take care of the body in many different ways as we've discussed. So how do you turn on these genes and make the proteins they make even more active? You want to rev up that system. So exercise will do it, fasting will do it. What about supplementation? Well, the first activator of the sirtuins that we discovered that acts on the enzyme to make it do a better job of cleaning up the body and protecting resveratrol We looked at thousands of different molecules, eventually tens of thousands. And the one that was the best was resveratrol in the dish. And then we gave it to little organisms, worms, and then flies and mice, eventually humans. And we saw that it activated that enzyme. So resveratrol is one way to activate it. And you can think of it as the accelerator pedal on a car. It revs it up, but there's something else that the sirtuins need to work and that's NAD and is a really small molecule, little chemical in the body that we need for life. It's used by the body for chemical reactions, for a hundred different reactions in the body. And without it, you're dead within seconds, you need NAD. The problem that we've seen is that NAD levels decline as you become obese, as you get older, if you don't ever get hungry and the body not only doesn't make enough of it, it's chewing it up as well. There's an enzyme called CD38 that Eric Verdin over at UCSF showed choose up. Now he's now at the Buck Institute in California, choose up NAD as you get older. So it's a double whammy. You don't make as much and chew it up, which is really bad because what we've shown in my lab and so have others is that NAD levels are really important for keeping those sirtuins and defenses at a useful level. And you can give a lot of resveratrol but if you don't have the fuel, you're basically accelerating a car that doesn't have enough gas. So you want to do both. And that's what I do. I take a precursor to NAD called NMN and the body uses that to make the NAD molecule in one step. And so I know from measuring dozens of human beings, that if you take NMN for the time period that I do, I've been taking it for years. But if you take it for about two weeks, you'll double on average, double your NAD levels in the blood. Okay, that's not public information. That's from clinical trials that are not yet published over the last two years. There are other ways to increase NAD levels in someone like me, who's getting older, I'm 52 now. You can take NR, which is used to make an amend, which is used to make NAD, and both NMN and NR are sold by companies in the US. NR is laxter phosphate, the phosphate is a small chemical the body needs. You've probably heard of the atom, phosphorus. Let's go back one step. How do you make NR? NR gets made from vitamin B3, often. You can also find it in milk and other foods, but sometimes people ask me, why don't you just take vitamin B3? And won't that just force the body to make NAD? And the answer is no, it doesn't work very well. We know this just by doing the experiment, but the reason I think is is that NAD, I said, it's a small molecule, but relative to vitamin B3, it's big. It's got those phosphates on there, it's got a sugar, it's got the vitamin B attached. So you've got all these components that come together to make this very complicated little molecule called NAD. When you give NMN, it contains all three components that the body needs to make NAD. If you give NR or just vitamin B3, which is an even smaller molecule, the body has to find these other components from somewhere else. So where do you get phosphate, well, the body needs it for DNA, it needs it for bones. So high doses of something that requires additional phosphate makes me a little concerned. And we have compared to NMN and NR head-to-head in mouse studies, for instance in NMN, we've shown in a cell paper a few years ago, makes mice run further, old mice can run 50% further 'cause they had better blood flow, better energy. NR are at the same dose, did not do that. In fact, it had no effect. - I see, dosage wise, if I were elect to take NMN in supplement form to increase my NAD levels and presumably slow my aging, how much NMN should I take? What's the protocol that you do? And are the various forms that are out there, are some better or some worse? - Well, I'm always happy to tell you what I do and what my father does, my 82-year-old father, we take a gram of NMN every day. - So it's a gram resveratrol and a gram of NMN. - Right. - Okay a thousand milligrams. - Now another important point, which is, I'm not the same as everybody else. I have a different microbiome, age, sex, right? And so I've been measuring myself and so I know if something's, or I think I know if something's making me better or worse based on measuring 45 different things. So I just want people to be aware that what I do may not perfectly or work at all for others, but I have studied, as I said, dozens of people who take NMN, at a gram, sometimes two grams. And I know by looking at all those people that without any exceptions, that if you do what I do, your NAD levels go up by about two fold or more. And so I do that every day, the thousand milligrams. Now people sell it. Now I never get into brands and all that. First of all, I don't have the time to measure products. I don't know, though I should say, I do want to say I'm working on a solution for people to know what works and what's real and what isn't, but I'm not there yet. And in the meantime, I would say, if you do want to buy this, let's say you want to buy NMN, look for a company that is well-established that has high levels of quality control. Look for three letters, GMP, which is good manufacturing practices. And so that means they make it under a certain level of quality control. You're not going to find iron filings in there and it probably has the stuff in it that they say it does. But so that's all I can say right now. I'm working on something that's going to be much more helpful, but overall, make sure it's white, crystalline NMN, and that to me, it tastes like burnt popcorn. - You crack open the capsules, and you'll take a little sample to make sure it tastes like burnt popcorn. - Well, when I'm making my capsules, I'll taste it and I do a lot of quality control on the stuff that I take. - Do you take that gram all at once with the resveratrol or do you take it spread throughout the day? - It's all in the morning for those things. So if I take Metformin, it's NMN and the resveratrol altogether. And there's a good reason for that. It's all scientific, I try to be. The levels of NAD go up in the morning in our bodies naturally. Our bodies actually have a cycle of NAD, it's not steady. - It's Arcadian? - It's Acadian. In fact, NAD controls your clock. This was shown by Shin Imai and colleagues in this nice science paper about a decade ago, that if you disrupt the NAD cycle, which is controlled by the sirtuin gene that we worked on, that is what's telling your body, oh, it's time to eat, it's time to go to sleep. And if you take these, the NMN late at night, for example, you can disrupt your circadian rhythms. - Interesting. - Conversely, when I travel and I want to reset my clock to the time zone, I will take a boost of NMN in the morning and I feel great. - Does this protocol for you, does it produce any immediate effects of increased energy, et cetera? You mentioned that one would, if it's right for them, would have to take it for at least two weeks to start to see the NAD levels increase. At that point, when NAD levels increase, could one possibly expect an increase in overall energy, focus, et cetera? I realize we're not making promises here, but I'm just wondering whether or not the only measure of whether or not this protocol is working is whether or not you die at age blank or blank plus 20. And of course, once you're dead, you can't really know if you would've lived longer if you'd done something differently and vice versa. - Sure, well, there was a study again by Shin Imai my good friend at Washington University in St. Louis that showed that improves, remember this insulin sensitivity, which is a good thing. But you can't know your insulin sensitivity unless you're measuring glucose, have a glucose monitor on your arm. - Do you have one on right now? - No, no, I used to, I learned a lot. - Yeah, last time I saw you had this thing, it looks like a small leach, not a large leach and it was measuring your blood glucose. - They're very informative because you learn what your body reacts to and grapes were really bad. Rhonda Patrick agrees with that, but the issue was, was what, where were we, Andrew? - The issue is whether or not you can expect any immediate effects on energy, vitality, focus, just even subject. - So what do you feel, is the question. And anecdotally, 'cause I've been taking this for a long time, if I don't take it, I start to feel 50 years old, it's horrible. I can't think straight. It may be placebo, but who knows? But what we're doing now are very careful clinical trials. We've done the safety for two years, and we're now treating elderly patients at Harvard Medical School with some wonderful colleagues. And those people are actually going to be an currently in MRIs. So you can measure the energetics and the NAD levels in their legs as they exercise in real time. And that will tell us if what we see in the mice is increased endurance actually works. In the meantime, it's fun to talk about anecdotes. I have a number of athlete friends, some of which have increased their load, their time in marathons, for example. There's a good friend of ours in our circle that is winning marathons at age 50 now. And he attributes that to the protocol that he's on. - Interesting, I haven't started taking NMN, but I'm planning to do that when my next birthday arrives, which is in a couple months. But I do experiments on my sister and have for years, I have a sister who's three years older than I am, who is very enthusiastic about these protocols. And I'll tell you that after reading your book, I started purchasing for her and giving her an NMN supplement and she claims and I believe her. She has a quite sensitive system and she's very tuned into it. She feels far and away better when she takes it, as opposed to when she doesn't and I've done the control experiment of removing her supply, and then giving it back to her in this kind of thing. So that's my other laboratory. This is what younger brothers do to their older sisters."}
{"question": "What are the effects on blood pressure when focusing one's visual attention on a particular location, and how can this relate to goal pursuit and performance improvement?", "doc_id": "t1F7EEGPQwo_8", "video_id": "t1F7EEGPQwo", "video_title": "The Science of Setting & Achieving Goals", "video_header": "How Vision Improves Performance: Blood Pressure", "segment_idx": "8", "time_start": "43:50", "time_end": "51:52", "context": "So what is special about focusing one's visual attention at a given location? Well, it turns out that we have two branches of our visual system. So visual information all comes in through our eyes, but then it can head down two different pathways. One pathway is engaged when our vision is brought to a common point, what we call, a vergence eye movement. So if we're focusing very intensely on a given point, regardless of how far away from us that point is, our visual system engages a certain set of neurons, neural circuits that are involved in resolving fine detail and that can evaluate small changes over small periods of time. Just think of it as a very detailed camera of the visual world. It tends to be very restricted. The other pathway through the visual system, is the so-called, magnocellular pathway. And this is a pathway that's involved in taking in global information about lots of things, that are happening around us. Movement of things to our right, movement of things to our left, things are happening down on the ground and all around us. And that pathway involves a sort of relaxation, if you will, of the neural circuits that are associated with alertness and attention. When you walk down the street and you're not thinking about much, provided you're not looking at your phone, you're not focusing on one location, you're more or less in a relaxed state, compared to when you're looking for a particular sign, you're looking for a bus or a train that's coming, or a particular person. And that should inherently make sense, when your level of attention and alertness goes up, there's sort of a small, but perceptible increase in your level of arousal. It's not really stress necessarily, but arousal of alertness. And it turns out that the visual system, accomplishes this increase in alertness by communicating with your circulatory system and the system that delivers blood and nutrients and oxygen to the rest of the tissues in your body. So let's talk for a second about what focusing our vision on a particular location does because in this study from the Balcetis Lab, what they found was, focusing on a goal line allows people, to move more effectively toward that goal. This is something you can leverage in all aspects of all goal pursuits. What happens when we focus on a particular location? Believe it or not, there's an increase in a particular feature of our blood pressure. Now your body has, of course, arteries, veins and capillaries, and your heart pumps blood, first to the arteries, and then to the other components of your vascular system. And we have so-called, blood pressure. Blood pressure is just how much, the fluid volume is pressing on those arteries, veins and capillaries. So you can imagine a pipe with very little fluid moving through it, that's low pressure. You have a pipe with a lot of fluid moving through it, that's even more pressure. You have a pipe with a lot of very viscous, meaning, very kind of sticky, thick stuff, moving forward, that's even more pressure. We have blood pressure and you've probably had your blood pressure measured. There's always two numbers. You have a top number, which is the systolic blood pressure. And then there's the bottom number, below the line, which is the diastolic pressure. So the important thing to understand, is that your blood pressure will rise when your heart beats, because there's more fluid moving through those pipes that are your arteries or veins and your capillaries. And that top number is called the systole or the systolic blood pressure, because that's the pressure at the time, when your heart contracts. So the top number, which normally, if you have a healthy blood pressure, is somewhere in the range of 90 to 120 millimeters of mercury. Millimeters of mercury is just the way, that pressure is measured. That top number, your systole, or your systolic blood pressure, is what's measured when the heart contracts. So, that's the amount of pressure when there's a heartbeat and it's moving through your vasculature. Now, between beats, the heartbeats, but then it relaxes, your blood pressure is going to drop to a lower value because fluid isn't being pumped through the system at those moments. And that's the bottom, the diastolic pressure. And typically for healthy people, that's going to be 60 to 80 millimeters of mercury. So you might hear about a normal blood pressure being about, again, this is an approximate, 120 over 80. What that means is, at the point where blood was being pumped through there, your arteries and veins, boom, that it's 120 millimeters of mercury, but then, when the heart relaxes for a second before the next beat, then it drops to 80. So there's high pressure, low pressure, high pressure, low pressure. The fluid is being pumped through the system. Now, why am I telling you all this? Well, it turns out, that there are neural circuits that link your visual system and focusing on a particular point with that top number, the systolic blood pressure. And when you focus your eyes on a particular location, that systolic blood pressure goes up, and there are some other systems that are coordinated with it in your brain and body, that start releasing adrenaline, low amounts of adrenaline in most cases. And that adrenaline, further readies your body for action. So, bringing our visual focus to a particular location, does a number of things to the brain and the whole system of the body, to prepare it, to place it into a state of readiness that makes us more likely to lean into our goals into action. And if we step back and think about this, this makes perfect sense. The brain and body need to be coordinated. We can't just think about a goal. In fact, a deer or a lion, can't just think about a goal. It has to think about a goal and then has to feel some sort of activation energy, some willingness or desire to move forward in pursuit of that goal. So imagining a goal, has to be coupled to the physical pursuit of the goal. So our visual system in a beautiful way, brings together a focus, literally, a visual focus on a particular point outside us. Then it recruits an increase in systolic blood pressure, which creates a systemic, a body-wide and brain-wide increase in fuel utilization, in oxygen availability, in our willingness to move forward as a body, as a whole coherent system. And then there are also neurotransmitter systems, like epinephrine, as we will soon see dopamine, that get recruited as well to place us into a continual mode of action. This to me is a remarkable feature of our physiology and it gets right to the point of some of the psychological phenomenon that we were talking about earlier. Let's just recall what some of those are. I won't list them all, but, a goal has to be significant, they say. All the psychologists, all the popular stuff online says, it has to be significant, has to be inspirational and has to be action oriented. So let's say you look out into the landscape of what's available to you, whether or not it's just in your mind, or you look at a specific point, you say, I want to go to that particular restaurant, to eat that particular food. And you orient towards it and you move towards it. This is the way that your brain and body, are coordinating their actions together. Conversely, when our visual system, is in a mode of looking at everything. When the aperture of our visual system is very broad, we know that there's also a reduction in our goal directed behavior and a reduction in the systolic blood pressure. It's as if our peripersonal space is sufficient, we don't need to get beyond our current state. We're not oriented toward any one thing in particular. So I've now described some of the psychology and some of the underlying physiology. Now, I'd like to mesh this within the context of actual specific goal setting and goal pursuit. Because what many of you are probably thinking is, well, that's some physiology, there's some psychology, but how do you actually apply this towards setting and achieving goals? Well, you do that, by understanding that your mental frame and your attention are always either positioned, to your peripersonal space, focused on your immediate possessions and state, or towards things outside you. But then you also have the ability, to dynamically travel back and forth between those. And so next, we're going to talk about, what the literature says about things like visualization, immediate and intermediate goals, long-term goals and how to best achieve those. And then we're going to move specifically into the protocols that you can use. It's a protocol that I've specifically developed for you, the listeners, in order to incorporate all the signs into a best practice, that you can do any time, any place, to really identify what it is specifically, that you want to pursue and the best route to pursue and achieve that goal. Focusing our visual attention on one particular point,"}
{"question": "How can eating more carbohydrate-rich foods or fasting and exercising impact my serotonin levels and mood?", "doc_id": "XfURDjegrAw_14", "video_id": "XfURDjegrAw", "video_title": "How Foods and Nutrients Control Our Moods", "video_header": "Serotonin: Gut, Brain, Satiety and Prozac", "segment_idx": "14", "time_start": "38:33", "time_end": "43:36", "context": "So the other neuromodulator that's really interesting in the context of the vagus is serotonin. Serotonin, just to remind you is a neuromodulator therefore it creates a bias in which neural circuits which neurons in the brain and body are going to be active and it makes it less likely the other ones are going to be active. I think it's fair to say without ever having measured it that my bulldog Costello, just his brain and body must be swimming in serotonin, because he's very calm and he eats a lot but he generally feels pretty sated. He's kind of an animal that's obsessed with comforts. He's a bit of a hedonist, and serotonin when it's elevated tends to make us feel really comfortable and kind of blissed out wherever we are. And that contrast with dopamine and epinephrin which mainly put us in pursuit of things. Motivation is pursuit. Serotonin is more about feeling really comfy where we are. The conversation around the brain body relationship and mood and serotonin for many years was, well, you eat a big meal. The gut is distended. You've got all the nutrients you need you rest and digest and serotonin is released. That's sorta true, but there's a lot more going on and a lot more that's interesting and actionable that's going on. First of all, some of you, but perhaps not all have heard that more than 90% of the serotonin that we make is in our gut. And indeed we have a lot of serotonin in our gut. We have neurons in our gut that makes serotonin. We have neurons in our brain that make serotonin, but here's the deal. Most of the serotonin that impacts our mood and our mental state is not in our gut. Most of it is in the neurons of the brain in an area called the raphae nucleus of the brain, there are a few other locations too, and those are the neurons that control whether or not we feel satiated or not. Whether or not we feel happy and calm. You can't have a discussion about serotonin without having discussion about antidepressants. Because during the late eighties and early nineties there was this explosion in the number of prescription drugs that were released. Things like first one and most famous one is Prozac, Zoloft and Paxil, a number of other ones that are so-called SSRI selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors. That's a long acronym, but basically those drugs work by preventing the gobbling up of serotonin or re-uptake of serotonin into neurons after it's been released which leads to more serotonin overall which means to elevate serotonin. And indeed those drugs were and can be very useful for certain people to feel better in cases of depression and some other clinical disorders as well. So I really don't want to dismiss them as useless or dangerous for everybody. They can be quite useful for many people. Not everyone responds well to them as I'm sure you've all heard. And their side effect profile has affects like blunting affect. It can make people feel kind of flat, kinda meh, it can reduce appetite for food. It can reduce appetite for sex. It can do all sorts of things, or it can work really well. Sometimes it's a dose-related issue, et cetera. Serotonin is fascinating however, because how well those neurons in the raphe work is impacted by some events within the gut. Although you might be surprised to find out what those events are. So let's go a little bit deeper into the gut. And again, the gut includes the stomach and then the small intestine in the large intestine and ask like, what is going on with serotonin in the gut? How is it impacting serotonin in the brain? And let's think about this in the context of how some of us might want to increase or decrease our serotonin levels. So as far as I know, there aren't any really good at home blood tests for things like serotonin and dopamine. There's some commercial products out there. But to me, just to me, I'm not particularly impressed. You know, it's not the same as getting your hormones levels measured or your metabolic factors measured, that's can be daunting. It can be done rigorously. There are tests out there. There are even some, believe it or not. There's some questionnaires that, and I think actually last year it made some of the bigger newspapers, are you more of a dopamine or a serotonin? Are you a this or that? I find that stuff to be a little silly although I do appreciate, and like the fact that people are thinking about and talking about neuromodulators there aren't really great ways to measure these things outside the clinic. There's some great clinical tools that you can get inside of a hospital or from a proper endocrinologist or neurologist, but no great at-home tool. So maybe that's a call to arms for some of you entrepreneurial folks out there to create these tests, accurate tests please, that could be done at home. But some people feel like they're too anxious or they're always in a motivated state and they're trying to adjust their serotonin. Many people adjust their serotonin by just eating more food and carbohydrate rich foods will increase serotonin. I've talked about this on a previous podcast but I personally am a big fan at least for me is I usually fast and exercise in the early part of the day"}
